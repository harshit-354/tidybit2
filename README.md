### How It Works

Question data lives in 663 CSV files (`data/companies/`), one per company. At build time, a prebuild script parses all CSVs into a single `public/data/questions.json`. The dashboard fetches this JSON client-side and caches it in localStorage.

No API routes. No database. No auth. Everything is statically generated.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run dev server (Turbopack)
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm run prebuild   # generates public/data/questions.json from CSVs
pnpm build          # static export to out/

# Lint & format
pnpm lint
pnpm format
```

### Deployment

#### Cloudflare Pages
```bash
pnpm run build:worker   # build for Cloudflare
pnpm run preview        # local preview with Wrangler
pnpm run deploy         # deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```

#### Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` configuration.
3. The build command will run `pnpm run prebuild` followed by `next build`.
4. Ensure you use `pnpm` if possible, though `npm` or `yarn` will also work with the provided config.
