# Suffix Array Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Suffix arrays are advanced string data structures that compress a string's entire set of suffixes into a sorted array of starting indices. While less common than hash maps or binary trees, they appear in hard-level interview questions at top tech companies, typically for problems involving repeated substrings, longest common prefixes, or complex string matching. Mastering suffix arrays demonstrates deep algorithmic knowledge and the ability to implement non-trivial constructions efficiently.

## Common Patterns

Suffix array problems generally follow three core patterns. Understanding these transforms complex string problems into manageable applications.

### 1. Longest Repeated Substring

The most frequent pattern uses the sorted suffixes to find repeated substrings efficiently. Adjacent suffixes in the sorted array share the longest common prefix (LCP). The longest repeated substring is simply the maximum LCP value between any two adjacent suffixes.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_repeated_substring(s: str) -> str:
    # Build suffix array and LCP array (implementation omitted for brevity)
    suffix_arr = build_suffix_array(s)
    lcp_arr = build_lcp_array(s, suffix_arr)

    max_len = 0
    start_idx = 0
    for i in range(len(lcp_arr)):
        if lcp_arr[i] > max_len:
            max_len = lcp_arr[i]
            start_idx = suffix_arr[i]
    return s[start_idx:start_idx + max_len]
```

```javascript
function longestRepeatedSubstring(s) {
  // Build suffix array and LCP array
  const suffixArr = buildSuffixArray(s);
  const lcpArr = buildLcpArray(s, suffixArr);

  let maxLen = 0;
  let startIdx = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lcpArr.length; i++) {
    if (lcpArr[i] > maxLen) {
      maxLen = lcpArr[i];
      startIdx = suffixArr[i];
    }
  }
  return s.substring(startIdx, startIdx + maxLen);
}
```

```java
public String longestRepeatedSubstring(String s) {
    int[] suffixArr = buildSuffixArray(s);
    int[] lcpArr = buildLcpArray(s, suffixArr);

    int maxLen = 0;
    int startIdx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lcpArr.length; i++) {
        if (lcpArr[i] > maxLen) {
            maxLen = lcpArr[i];
            startIdx = suffixArr[i];
        }
    }
    return s.substring(startIdx, startIdx + maxLen);
}
```

</div>

### 2. Multiple String Operations

Many problems involve finding common substrings across multiple strings. The standard approach concatenates strings with unique delimiter characters, builds a combined suffix array and LCP array, then uses a sliding window or grouping technique to find suffixes originating from different original strings.

### 3. Counting Distinct Substrings

The total number of distinct substrings in a string of length `n` is `n(n+1)/2`. Using the suffix array and LCP array, you subtract the sum of all LCP values from this total, since LCP values represent overlapping prefixes already counted.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def count_distinct_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    suffix_arr = build_suffix_array(s)
    lcp_arr = build_lcp_array(s, suffix_arr)

    total = n * (n + 1) // 2
    return total - sum(lcp_arr)
```

```javascript
function countDistinctSubstrings(s) {
  const n = s.length;
  const suffixArr = buildSuffixArray(s);
  const lcpArr = buildLcpArray(s, suffixArr);

  const total = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  return total - lcpArr.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
}
```

```java
public int countDistinctSubstrings(String s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int[] suffixArr = buildSuffixArray(s);
    int[] lcpArr = buildLcpArray(s, suffixArr);

    int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    int lcpSum = 0;
    for (int lcp : lcpArr) {
        lcpSum += lcp;
    }
    return total - lcpSum;
}
```

</div>

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a striking distribution: 100% of suffix array questions are categorized as Hard, with zero Easy or Medium questions. This reflects the specialized nature of the topic. Suffix arrays require:

- Implementing or applying complex construction algorithms (like doubling algorithm or SA-IS)
- Combining with auxiliary data structures like LCP arrays
- Solving optimization problems with non-obvious transformations

Interviewers use these questions to separate exceptional candidates who can handle advanced algorithms under time pressure. You won't encounter suffix arrays in screening rounds; they appear in onsite interviews for specialized roles involving text processing, bioinformatics, or search infrastructure.

## Which Companies Ask Suffix Array

Top companies known for asking suffix array questions include:

- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – for search and substring matching in large-scale systems
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – in financial text processing applications
- [Coupang](/company/coupang) – in e-commerce search and recommendation systems
- [Goldman Sachs](/company/goldman-sachs) – in genomic data analysis and quantitative research
- [Google](/company/google) – across search, storage, and bioinformatics teams

These companies test suffix arrays because they operate at scales where naive string algorithms fail, and they value candidates who understand advanced data structures.

## Study Tips

1. **Master Construction First** – Implement the O(n log n) doubling algorithm until you can write it from memory. Understand how the radix sort step works and why it achieves the time complexity.
2. **Practice LCP Array Construction** – The Kasai algorithm for building the LCP array in O(n) is almost always required. Be able to derive it from the definition and suffix array properties.
3. **Solve Pattern Variations** – Work through problems applying the three core patterns to different constraints: multiple strings, length limitations, or k-th distinct substring queries.
4. **Know When to Use Alternatives** – Recognize when suffix trees (Ukkonen's algorithm) might be conceptually simpler, but understand why suffix arrays are preferred in practice for their memory efficiency and cache performance.

Suffix array questions are challenging but predictable. Focus on the patterns, implement the core algorithms repeatedly, and you'll be prepared when they appear in your interview.
