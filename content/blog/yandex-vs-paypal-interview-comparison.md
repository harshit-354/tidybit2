When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. Both Yandex and PayPal are prominent names, but their interview processes reflect their distinct engineering cultures and product domains. Yandex, often called the "Google of Russia," emphasizes algorithmic problem-solving at scale, while PayPal, a global payments leader, focuses on robust, secure, and efficient data processing. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total volume of cataloged questions provides insight into the breadth of problems you might encounter.

**Yandex** has a larger public repository with **134 questions**. Its difficulty distribution is heavily weighted toward medium-level problems:

- **Easy:** 52 questions (39%)
- **Medium:** 72 questions (54%)
- **Hard:** 10 questions (7%)

This skew toward medium-difficulty questions suggests Yandex interviews are designed to thoroughly assess foundational data structures and algorithmic thinking under typical constraints, with fewer extremely complex optimization puzzles.

**PayPal** has **106 cataloged questions**. Its distribution shows a stronger emphasis on challenging problems:

- **Easy:** 18 questions (17%)
- **Medium:** 69 questions (65%)
- **Hard:** 19 questions (18%)

PayPal's significantly lower percentage of Easy questions and higher percentage of Hard questions indicates its interviews may probe deeper into edge cases, optimization, and advanced problem-solving, likely reflecting the need for highly reliable and performant code in financial systems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies concentrate on a similar core set of fundamental topics, which is common across the industry. However, the frequency and context of these topics can differ.

The top four topics for both are nearly identical:

- **Yandex:** Array, Hash Table, String, Two Pointers
- **PayPal:** Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting

This reveals a strong shared focus on **data manipulation and lookup efficiency**. Array and String problems form the backbone, often tested through slicing, searching, and transformation tasks. Hash Table questions assess your ability to achieve O(1) lookups for counting, deduplication, and mapping.

A key difference is Yandex's explicit highlighting of **Two Pointers**, a pattern essential for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings (e.g., finding pairs, palindromes, or merging intervals). PayPal's listed emphasis on **Sorting** suggests questions where pre-processing data is a critical first step to enable efficient solutions, which is common in transaction or log analysis scenarios.

In practice, you must master these patterns across languages. For example, a classic Two Pointers problem:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should depend on your interview timeline and strengths.

**Prepare for Yandex first if:** You are building your core algorithmic foundation. The higher volume of Easy and Medium questions provides a broader set of problems to practice fundamental patterns like Two Pointers, Hash Table usage, and array/string manipulation. Succeeding here will solidify the skills needed for most technical interviews.

**Prepare for PayPal first if:** You are already comfortable with fundamentals and need to level up on optimization and complex problem-solving. The higher proportion of Hard questions demands a deeper mastery of topics, often requiring you to combine patterns (e.g., Sorting + Two Pointers) or handle intricate constraints. This preparation will rigorously test your ability to derive efficient, correct solutions.

For a comprehensive strategy, start with the shared core: **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. Achieve fluency in these before specializing. If targeting both companies, Yandex's list offers excellent medium-difficulty practice, while PayPal's list provides the challenging problems to push your limits.
