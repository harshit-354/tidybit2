When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. PayPal and Coupang, while both major tech companies, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus areas. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of reported questions is the most immediate difference. PayPal's list stands at **106 questions**, more than double Coupang's **53 questions**. This suggests PayPal's interview process may draw from a broader pool of problems or that more candidate data is available.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The majority (65%) of questions are Medium difficulty, with a nearly even split between Easy (17%) and Hard (18%). This indicates a strong focus on core algorithmic problem-solving with a significant, but not overwhelming, hard problem component.
- **Coupang (E3/M36/H14):** The distribution skews more heavily toward challenging problems. A full 68% are Medium, but only 6% are Easy, while 26% are Hard. This profile suggests Coupang's interviews may place a greater emphasis on complex problem-solving and optimization from the outset.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** fundamentals. These are the building blocks for most data manipulation and lookup problems. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator is the fourth major topic:

- **PayPal** lists **Sorting**. This aligns with a focus on data organization, searching, and often serves as a prerequisite or component for more complex algorithms (e.g., "Merge Intervals" or "Two Sum" on a sorted array).
- **Coupang** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This signals a clear expectation to tackle optimization problems involving overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, which are typically more conceptually challenging.

This distinction influences the problem styles. PayPal questions may more frequently involve rearranging, merging, or comparing sorted data. Coupang questions are more likely to include problems about maximizing profit, minimizing cost, or counting ways to achieve a result.

```python
# Example: A Sorting-centric problem (common pattern for PayPal)
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged

# Example: A DP problem (common pattern for Coupang)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A Sorting-centric problem (common pattern for PayPal)
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}

// Example: A DP problem (common pattern for Coupang)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A Sorting-centric problem (common pattern for PayPal)
public int[][] mergeIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}

// Example: A DP problem (common pattern for Coupang)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **PayPal first** if you are early in your interview preparation cycle. Its larger question bank with a more balanced difficulty spread (including more Easy problems) provides a wider set of foundational problems. Mastering the core topics—especially Sorting and its applications—will build a strong base. This foundation is directly transferable and will make tackling Coupang's DP-heavy list less daunting.

Prepare for **Coupang first** if you are already comfortable with arrays, strings, hash tables, and sorting, and need to deep-dive into advanced topics. Focusing on Coupang will force you to master Dynamic Programming, which is a high-leverage topic for many top-tier companies. Success here means you will likely find PayPal's problem set more approachable, as the core topics overlap and the difficulty ceiling is generally lower.

In summary, use PayPal for broad foundational practice and Coupang for targeted, advanced depth in DP.
