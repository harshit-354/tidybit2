When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Intuit and Coupang, while both major tech firms, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. Intuit, a financial software giant, emphasizes foundational data structures with a broad question set. Coupang, South Korea's e-commerce leader, presents a more concentrated but similarly challenging profile. This comparison analyzes their question banks to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of documented questions. Intuit's list of **71 questions** significantly outnumbers Coupang's **53 questions**. This suggests Intuit's interview process may draw from a wider pool of problems or has been more extensively documented by candidates.

The difficulty distribution also reveals a strategic nuance:

- **Intuit (71q):** Easy 10 | Medium 47 | Hard 14
- **Coupang (53q):** Easy 3 | Medium 36 | Hard 14

Intuit includes more **Easy** questions, which often serve as warm-ups or screeners for fundamental understanding. Coupang's near absence of Easy questions (only 3) indicates their process dives directly into **Medium** and **Hard** complexity. Both companies have an identical number of **Hard** questions (14), confirming that neither interview is a walk in the park. The core of both processes is decisively Medium-difficulty problem-solving.

## Topic Overlap

The stated focus areas for both companies are nearly identical, just in a slightly different order: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This high overlap means core preparation for one company directly benefits the other.

**Arrays and Strings** are the bedrock. Expect problems involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and segmentation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer on a String (Palindrome Check)
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer on a String (Palindrome Check)
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer on a String (Palindrome Check)
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Hash Tables** are critical for efficient lookups and frequency counting, often combined with array or string problems.

**Dynamic Programming** is the key differentiator for tackling harder problems. Both companies have a significant number of Hard questions, many of which will likely involve DP patterns for optimization, such as knapsack, longest common subsequence, or state machine problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci)
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci)
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci)
public int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Intuit**. Its larger question bank with more Easy problems provides a gentler on-ramp to master the four core topics. Solving Intuit's problems will build a strong, broad foundation in Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and DP. The Easy questions help cement syntax and simple patterns before escalating complexity.

Once comfortable with Intuit's spectrum, transition to **Coupang**. Your core skills will already be sharp. The adjustment will be acclimating to a process that starts at a Medium difficulty level and maintains a high ceiling. Focus on practicing Coupang's specific list to recognize any subtle preferences in problem framing, but the underlying technical skills are fully transferable.

In essence, preparing for Intuit builds the comprehensive toolkit needed to tackle Coupang's more concentrated and immediately challenging interview.
