When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes. Snapchat and Morgan Stanley, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks on TidyBit. Snapchat's list is larger and more heavily weighted toward hard problems, reflecting its product-driven engineering culture focused on scalable, real-time systems. Morgan Stanley's list is smaller with a greater emphasis on medium problems, aligning with the financial industry's need for robust, accurate, and often mathematically-inclined solutions. Understanding the volume, difficulty, and core topics is key to efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a clear story about the intensity and focus of each company's technical screening.

**Snapchat** has a substantial bank of **99 questions**, categorized as 99 Easy, 62 Medium, and 31 Hard problems. The high proportion of Hard problems (over 30%) is notable. This suggests that for roles at Snapchat, especially senior levels, interviewers deeply test candidates on complex algorithmic thinking, optimization, and handling edge cases—skills critical for maintaining a high-performance social media app.

**Morgan Stanley** has a more curated list of **53 questions**: 13 Easy, 34 Medium, and 6 Hard. The distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty (roughly 64%), with a much smaller share of Hard problems (about 11%). This indicates a strong focus on assessing core competency and reliable problem-solving under typical constraints, which is paramount in financial software where correctness and stability are non-negotiable.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but their secondary focuses diverge, hinting at different application domains.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems form the foundation for both. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

**Diverging Specialties:**

- **Snapchat** lists **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** as a top topic. This aligns with problems involving level-order traversal, shortest path in unweighted graphs (e.g., social networks), or matrix traversal—common in features like stories, maps, or chat connectivity.
- **Morgan Stanley** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. This is critical for finance-related algorithms involving optimization, sequence analysis, or combinatorial counting (e.g., maximizing profit, risk calculation, or path counting).

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and the foundational nature of the topics.

If your goal is a **software engineering role at a tech-first, product-centric company**, start with **Snapchat's** list. Mastering its large volume of problems, especially the high number of Hard questions, will build exceptional algorithmic stamina. Proficiency in BFS and graph algorithms is broadly applicable across the tech industry. Conquering this list will make many other tech interviews feel more manageable.

If your goal is a **software or quantitative role in finance, or you are building core problem-solving skills**, start with **Morgan Stanley's** list. The strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems across core data structures provides a solid, well-rounded foundation. Deeply understanding Dynamic Programming, a challenging but fundamental paradigm, is invaluable and will serve you in many interview settings. This list offers a efficient path to demonstrating strong, reliable coding ability.

Ultimately, the shared core of Array, String, and Hash Table problems means preparation for one company significantly benefits the other. Start with the list that best matches your career target or provides the most relevant challenge to your current skill level.
