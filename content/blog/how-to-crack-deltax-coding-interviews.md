Deltax is known for a rigorous, single-round technical interview that tests both algorithmic problem-solving and clean code implementation. Candidates report a 60-minute session with three coding questions, conducted via a collaborative editor. Success requires not just correct answers, but efficient, well-explained solutions under pressure.

## By the Numbers — difficulty breakdown and what it means

The Deltax interview consistently follows a 1:1:1 ratio: one **Easy**, one **Medium**, and one **Hard** problem within the 60-minute window. This distribution is critical to understand. The Easy question is your warm-up and a chance to demonstrate clarity and communication. The Medium question is the core test of your standard algorithmic knowledge. The Hard question is the differentiator, designed to see how you handle complexity, optimization, and edge cases under time constraints.

With only 20 minutes allocated per problem on average, time management is paramount. You cannot afford to get stuck debugging the Easy problem. The structure suggests a clear strategy: solve the Easy problem quickly and flawlessly, use solid patterns on the Medium, and apply systematic problem-solving (even if incomplete) on the Hard.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Analysis of past questions reveals a clear set of high-probability topics. Prioritize these.

- **Hash Table:** The most frequent tool, essential for achieving O(1) lookups and solving problems involving counts, duplicates, or complements (like the Two Sum pattern).
- **Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or clever computations without brute force. Tests logical reasoning.
- **String:** Manipulation, parsing, palindrome checks, and substring searches are common. Often combined with hash tables or two-pointer techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A hallmark for their Hard problems. You must recognize overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, typically in sequences or grids.
- **Recursion:** Foundational for tree/graph traversal and divide-and-conquer algorithms. Understanding the call stack and base cases is non-negotiable.

The single most important pattern to master is the **Hash Table-based complement search**, as it's the cornerstone for the classic Two Sum problem and its many variants. Here is the implementation across languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example usage would return [0, 1]
```

</div>

For **Dynamic Programming**, the pattern for a 1D sequence problem, like finding the longest increasing subsequence or ways to climb stairs, is fundamental.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Climbing Stairs (DP pattern)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]  # Recurrence relation
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Climbing Stairs (DP pattern)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Recurrence relation
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Climbing Stairs (DP pattern)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Recurrence relation
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 week study plan

A focused, topic-based plan is effective for Deltax's known distribution.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Master Easy problems on the top five topics. Ensure you can implement hash table, string traversal, and basic recursion solutions in under 10 minutes. Goal: automaticity on the first interview question.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Competence.** Tackle Medium problems exclusively. For each topic (Hash Table, Math, String, DP, Recursion), solve 8-10 problems. Focus on identifying the pattern within the first two minutes of reading. Practice explaining your approach aloud as you code.

**Week 5: Hard Focus & Integration.** Dedicate this week to Hard problems, particularly DP and complex recursion. Don't aim to solve all perfectly; aim to break them down, identify subproblems, and write a partial, structured solution. Time-box attempts to 25 minutes.

**Week 6: Mock Interviews & Review.** Simulate the exact interview format: three problems (Easy, Medium, Hard) in 60 minutes. Use a timer and a plain text editor. Review not just correctness, but your speed on the Easy problem and your problem-solving process on the Hard one.

## Key Tips

1.  **Control the Clock.** Strictly budget 10 minutes for Easy, 20 for Medium, and 25 for Hard, leaving 5 minutes for initial review and final questions. If you hit the limit, verbally summarize your remaining approach and move on.
2.  **Communicate Before Coding.** For every problem, restate the question in your own words, give 1-2 short examples, and outline your algorithm and its complexity _before_ writing the first line of code. This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Start with a Brute Force.** For Medium and Hard problems, immediately state a naive solution and its complexity. This is your fallback and shows you can analyze trade-offs. Then, and only then, optimize.
4.  **Write Clean, Compilable Code First.** Avoid one-letter variables. Use helper functions. Write code you might see in a codebase. A correct, readable solution is better than a bug-optimal but cryptic one.
5.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring done, verbally run through small, large, empty, and negative input cases. Fix any issues. This is the simplest way to catch major bugs.

Mastering this blend of pattern recognition, time management, and clear communication is how you pass the Deltax interview. Practice under the real constraints.
