Hash tables are the workhorse data structure of coding interviews. With **O(1)** average-time lookups, insertions, and deletions, they transform problems that would be **O(n²)** with brute force into manageable **O(n)** solutions. Interviewers love them because they test a candidate's ability to recognize the need for fast access and to map real-world relationships into key-value pairs. Mastering hash tables isn't just about knowing the syntax for `dict`, `Map`, or `HashMap`; it's about spotting the patterns where they provide a critical optimization.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing these recurring scenarios will help you instantly reach for a hash table.

### 1. The Frequency Counter

This is the most fundamental pattern. Use a hash table to count occurrences of elements (characters, numbers, etc.). It's the go-to for "check if anagrams," "find the missing number," or "identify the duplicate."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for char in t:
        if char not in count:
            return False
        count[char] -= 1
        if count[char] == 0:
            del count[char]
    return len(count) == 0
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = new Map();
  for (const char of s) {
    count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (const char of t) {
    if (!count.has(char)) return false;
    count.set(char, count.get(char) - 1);
    if (count.get(char) === 0) count.delete(char);
  }
  return count.size === 0;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
    Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (!count.containsKey(c)) return false;
        count.put(c, count.get(c) - 1);
        if (count.get(c) == 0) count.remove(c);
    }
    return count.isEmpty();
}
```

</div>

### 2. The Complement Map (Two-Sum Pattern)

When you need to find two elements satisfying a condition (like summing to a target), store each element's complement as you iterate. This avoids a nested loop.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    seen = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

### 3. The Adjacency Storage (Graph & Cache)

Hash tables excel at storing relationships, like graph adjacency lists, or caching results for Dynamic Programming (memoization). This pattern is key for problems involving networks, dependencies, or recursive computations.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our dataset of 609 questions splits as: **Easy: 148 (24%), Medium: 350 (57%), Hard: 111 (18%)**. This distribution is telling.

- **Easy** problems typically test your basic operational knowledge—can you implement a frequency counter or a complement check? They are often a single-step application.
- **Medium** problems, the majority, require you to _combine_ the hash table with another technique. Think "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" (hash table + sliding window) or "Clone Graph" (hash table + BFS/DFS). The hash table is the core enabler, but you must integrate it into a larger algorithm.
- **Hard** problems push the concept further, often requiring you to design a custom data structure (like an LRU Cache, which combines a hash map and a doubly linked list) or use hash tables in non-obvious ways within complex graph or string algorithms.

## Which Companies Ask Hash Table

Hash tables are universal, but some top tech companies are particularly known for emphasizing them due to their importance in systems design (caching, databases, distributed systems).

- [Google](/company/google) - Frequently asks problems involving string manipulation, system design fundamentals (caches), and graph traversal.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) - Common in problems related to customer data processing, shopping cart logic, and AWS-style system components.
- [Meta](/company/meta) - Heavily featured in problems about social networks (graph relationships), content identification, and real-time data.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) - Often appears in string algorithms, system design questions, and array manipulation problems.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) - Common in financial data processing, real-time analytics, and matching problems.

## Study Tips

1.  **Internalize the Patterns, Not Just Problems.** When you solve a problem, label it with its core hash table pattern (e.g., "Frequency Counter," "Complement Map"). This builds mental shortcuts for future questions.
2.  **Practice the Multi-Technique Blend.** Since most problems are Medium, don't just practice hash tables in isolation. Drill problems that combine them with two pointers, sliding windows, and graph search.
3.  **Know Your Language's Implementation.** Understand the time complexity guarantees and API of your language's primary hash table (`dict`, `Map`, `HashMap`). Know how to handle default values and iterations cleanly.
4.  **Start with the Brute Force, Then Optimize.** If stuck, first describe the **O(n²)** nested loop solution. Then ask, "What am I repeatedly looking up?" The answer to that question is almost always your hash table key.
