When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Adobe and Capital One, while both prominent in their respective industries, present distinct interview landscapes for software engineering roles. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of available practice material. On platforms like TidyBit, Adobe's question bank is significantly larger, with **227 documented questions** compared to Capital One's **57**. This volume suggests Adobe's interview process is more extensively documented and potentially draws from a wider, more established set of problems.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring emphases:

- **Adobe (E68/M129/H30):** The distribution is centered on **Medium difficulty**, which constitutes about 57% of its questions. This indicates a strong focus on core algorithmic problem-solving under typical interview constraints. The substantial number of Easy questions (30%) often serves as warm-ups or tests for fundamental coding fluency, while the Hard problems (13%) target candidates for more senior or specialized roles.
- **Capital One (E11/M36/H10):** The pattern is similar but scaled down, with **Medium difficulty** also being the majority at about 63%. The proportions are comparable, but the smaller overall pool means you can achieve broader coverage of Capital One's problem set with less total study time.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures and algorithms. The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator lies in their secondary focuses:

- **Adobe** prominently features **Two Pointers** as a core topic. This technique is essential for solving a class of efficient array and string manipulation problems, such as finding pairs, removing duplicates, or sliding window subarrays.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read-1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

- **Capital One** lists **Math** as a primary topic. This suggests a higher likelihood of encountering problems involving number properties, basic arithmetic transformations, or mathematical logic, which may be less frequent in Adobe's core set.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Math example: Reverse Integer
def reverse(x):
    INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1
    rev = 0
    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
    x = abs(x)
    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10
        x //= 10
        # Check for overflow before multiplying
        if rev > (INT_MAX // 10) or (rev == INT_MAX // 10 and pop > 7):
            return 0
        rev = rev * 10 + pop
    return rev * sign
```

```javascript
// Math example: Reverse Integer
function reverse(x) {
  const INT_MAX = 2 ** 31 - 1;
  const INT_MIN = -(2 ** 31);
  let rev = 0;
  while (x !== 0) {
    const pop = x % 10;
    x = Math.trunc(x / 10);
    if (rev > Math.floor(INT_MAX / 10) || (rev === Math.floor(INT_MAX / 10) && pop > 7)) return 0;
    if (rev < Math.ceil(INT_MIN / 10) || (rev === Math.ceil(INT_MIN / 10) && pop < -8)) return 0;
    rev = rev * 10 + pop;
  }
  return rev;
}
```

```java
// Math example: Reverse Integer
public int reverse(int x) {
    int rev = 0;
    while (x != 0) {
        int pop = x % 10;
        x /= 10;
        if (rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
        if (rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
        rev = rev * 10 + pop;
    }
    return rev;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your goals and timeline. **Start with Capital One if you are new to technical interviews or have a shorter timeline.** The smaller, focused question bank allows you to efficiently cover their core patterns, including the notable Math problems, and build confidence. The foundational Array, String, and Hash Table practice will directly transfer to any other company.

**Begin with Adobe if you are preparing for a longer cycle, targeting multiple top tech companies, or have already built solid fundamentals.** The large volume and Medium-difficulty focus provide rigorous, comprehensive practice that will make you competitive for a wide range of roles. Mastering Adobe's set, including Two Pointers patterns, will thoroughly prepare you for Capital One's more contained problem scope, though you should still review Capital One's specific Math-focused questions.

Regardless of your starting point, ensure you practice the overlapping core topics thoroughly. For targeted practice, visit the Adobe question bank at [TidyBit /company/adobe](/company/adobe) and the Capital One question bank at [TidyBit /company/capital-one](/company/capital-one).
