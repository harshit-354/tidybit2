Medium questions at Snapchat typically assess a candidate's ability to implement efficient, correct solutions to common algorithmic problems under interview conditions. These problems often involve arrays, strings, graphs, or trees, requiring you to apply core data structures and algorithms. The focus is on clean, working code and clear communication, not just theoretical knowledge. With 62 Medium-difficulty questions in their known question pool, preparation is highly pattern-based.

## Common Patterns

Snapchat's Medium questions frequently test a few key areas. Recognizing these patterns is crucial for rapid problem-solving.

**Graph and Tree Traversal:** Questions involving social networks (connections) or hierarchical data often use BFS/DFS.

<div class="code-group">
```python
def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process node
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            queue.append(neighbor)
```
```javascript
function bfs(root) {
    if (!root) return;
    const queue = [root];
    while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        // Process node
        for (const neighbor of node.neighbors) {
            queue.push(neighbor);
        }
    }
}
```
```java
public void bfs(Node root) {
    if (root == null) return;
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node node = queue.poll();
        // Process node
        for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
            queue.offer(neighbor);
        }
    }
}
```
</div>

**Array/String Manipulation:** Problems like finding subarrays, encoding/decoding, or two-pointer techniques are common.
**Dynamic Programming:** Used for optimization problems, such as "minimum path" or "maximum subarray" variants.

## Time Targets

For a 45-minute interview slot, you should aim to solve a Medium problem within **25-30 minutes**. This timeline includes:

- **2-3 minutes:** Clarifying the problem and edge cases with the interviewer.
- **10-12 minutes:** Designing the approach, discussing time/space complexity, and getting approval.
- **10-12 minutes:** Writing clean, syntactically correct code in your chosen language.
- **3-5 minutes:** Testing your code with provided and edge-case examples verbally or with quick dry runs.

If you finish early, use the remaining time to discuss optimizations or alternative approaches. Running over 30 minutes without a complete solution significantly reduces your chances of success.

## Practice Strategy

To use Snapchat's Medium questions effectively:

1. **Pattern-First Practice:** Sort questions by topic (graphs, arrays, DP). Solve 3-5 on the same pattern in one session to build muscle memory.
2. **Strict Timing:** Always use a timer. Practice the 25-minute target in a quiet environment to simulate pressure.
3. **Verbalize Your Process:** As you practice, explain your reasoning out loud. Interviewers evaluate your communication as much as your code.
4. **Post-Solution Analysis:** After solving, review the optimal solution. If your approach differed, note why the better solution is more efficient for next time.
5. **Prioritize High-Frequency Questions:** Focus on problems that appear frequently in Snapchat interviews, as identified on platforms like TidyBit.
