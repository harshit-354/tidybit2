When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and difficulty of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Oracle and Yandex, while both being large technology firms, present distinct interview landscapes. Oracle's process is known for its breadth and classic algorithmic rigor, whereas Yandex's process, while still challenging, tends to be more focused and leans towards practical problem-solving. A strategic comparison of their question volumes, difficulty distributions, and core topics reveals clear preparation priorities.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Oracle's listed repository of **340 questions** is over 2.5 times larger than Yandex's **134 questions**. This volume alone suggests a broader potential scope in Oracle's interviews.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **Oracle (E70/M205/H65):** The difficulty curve is heavily weighted towards **Medium (205 questions)**, with a significant number of **Hard (65)** problems. This indicates an interview process that deeply tests algorithmic mastery and the ability to handle complex, multi-layered problems. The 70 Easy questions likely serve as foundational warm-ups.
- **Yandex (E52/M72/H10):** The distribution is skewed heavily towards **Easy (52)** and **Medium (72)** problems, with only a minimal number of **Hard (10)**. This suggests Yandex interviews may prioritize correctness, clean code, and efficient problem-solving on common patterns over tackling the most complex algorithmic puzzles.

This contrast means preparing for Oracle requires enduring a longer, more arduous grind against challenging problems, while Yandex preparation can be more about speed, accuracy, and breadth over moderate difficulty.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures, but with a subtle shift in priority.

**Shared Core Topics:** **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the absolute core for both. You cannot go wrong mastering these. Dynamic Programming is also crucial for Oracle's harder problems, while Two Pointers is a key technique for Yandex's array and string questions.

**Oracle's Distinct Edge:** **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a defining topic for Oracle, essential for tackling its substantial pool of Medium and Hard questions. Expect to see classic DP variations on sequences, knapsack problems, and pathfinding.

**Yandex's Distinct Edge:** **Two Pointers** is explicitly highlighted for Yandex. This technique is fundamental for solving a wide array of efficient array and string manipulation problems, such as finding pairs, removing duplicates, or checking palindromes, often with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

Here is a typical "Two Pointers" problem relevant to Yandex:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

And here is a classic "Dynamic Programming" problem central to Oracle preparation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

The strategic choice depends on your timeline and interview schedule.

**Prepare for Yandex first if:** You are interviewing with Yandex sooner, or you are building foundational confidence. The smaller, less daunting question bank allows for a more focused and potentially quicker preparation cycle. Solidifying the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and mastering the Two Pointers technique will cover a large portion of their question pool.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You have an Oracle interview first, or you have ample time and want to tackle the more challenging set. Successfully preparing for Oracle's extensive and difficult problem set will inherently cover nearly all the ground needed for Yandex. The reverse is not true; preparing only for Yandex's scope would leave you underprepared for Oracle's depth and DP focus.

In essence, Oracle preparation is a superset of Yandex preparation in terms of difficulty and topic depth. Conquering Oracle's list is a more comprehensive, albeit more demanding, training regimen.
