When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly streamline your study process. IBM and Visa, while both prominent in the tech landscape, present distinct interview profiles based on their core business needs—IBM with its broad enterprise software and consulting focus, and Visa with its deep specialization in digital payments and financial systems. A direct comparison of their coding question libraries reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis, which should guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

IBM's question bank is notably larger, with 170 total questions categorized as 52 Easy, 102 Medium, and 16 Hard. This volume suggests a broader scope of assessment, likely reflecting the diverse range of technical roles across its consulting, cloud, and software divisions. The heavy skew toward Medium-difficulty questions (60% of the total) indicates that interviewers prioritize solid, reliable problem-solving over extreme algorithmic cleverness. You can expect questions that test fundamental competency applied with careful logic.

Visa's set is smaller at 124 questions, with 32 Easy, 72 Medium, and 20 Hard. While also Medium-dominant (58%), Visa has a slightly higher proportion of Hard questions (16% vs IBM's 9%). This may point to a greater emphasis on optimizing complex systems or handling intricate data processing scenarios inherent to high-volume, low-latency financial transactions. The smaller overall volume could mean a more focused, deeper dive into specific problem domains during the interview.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, which are foundational to most coding interviews. **Sorting** is also a common topic for both. The key divergence is in the fourth major area: IBM highlights **Two Pointers**, while Visa highlights **Hash Table**.

IBM's focus on **Two Pointers** aligns with problems involving sorted data, searching, or in-place array manipulation—common in data processing and optimization tasks.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

Visa's emphasis on **Hash Table** (Hash Map/Dictionary) is critical for problems involving fast lookups, frequency counting, and transaction or user ID mapping—core operations in payment systems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Hash Table: Two Sum
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Hash Table: Two Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Hash Table: Two Sum
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with IBM if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. Its larger set of Medium-difficulty questions on fundamental topics like Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers provides a comprehensive workout for core algorithmic thinking. Mastering this foundation will make you interview-ready for a wide range of companies.

Prioritize Visa if you are already comfortable with fundamentals and want to tackle problems with a sharper focus on efficiency and lookup optimization. The higher density of Hard questions and the emphasis on Hash Tables require a deeper understanding of time-space tradeoffs, which is excellent preparation for roles involving data-intensive systems.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in Arrays, Strings, and Sorting means preparation for one company directly benefits the other. Solidify those universal skills first, then drill into Two Pointers for IBM or Hash Tables for Visa based on your target.
