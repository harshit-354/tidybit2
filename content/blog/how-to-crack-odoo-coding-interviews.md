Odoo’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical coding ability and problem-solving skills relevant to building business applications. Candidates typically face one or two rounds of algorithmic coding interviews, often conducted via platforms like Codility or HackerRank, focusing on clean, efficient solutions to common data structure problems. The emphasis is on correctness, performance, and maintainable code over obscure computer science theory.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Odoo’s coding interview questions skew heavily towards foundational concepts. The distribution is approximately 67% Easy and 33% Medium questions, with Hard problems being exceptionally rare. This breakdown signals a clear priority: Odoo values strong, reliable fundamentals over solving esoteric puzzles. They are testing for engineers who can write robust, bug-free code for common business logic scenarios—like data validation, transformation, and system design—not for those who have memorized every dynamic programming trick. Your goal is to master the basics and execute them flawlessly under time pressure.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are String manipulation, Stack operations, System Design principles, and the Two Pointers technique. You should prioritize these areas in your preparation.

**String Manipulation**
Expect problems involving parsing, validation, comparison, or transformation of string data, which is ubiquitous in business software. Common tasks include checking palindromes, formatting text, or implementing basic string functions.

**Stack**
The Stack data structure is crucial for problems related to parsing, undo/redo functionality, and validating sequences (like parentheses matching in expressions or XML tags). It’s a core pattern for managing nested or hierarchical data.

**System Design (Conceptual)**
While not always a full-scale system design interview, Odoo often includes questions on designing a specific module or feature (e.g., a booking system, a state machine). Focus on clear requirements gathering, defining data models, and outlining key APIs or interactions.

**Two Pointers**
This technique is essential for optimizing array and string algorithms, especially for tasks like finding pairs, removing duplicates in-place, or checking for substrings. It’s a hallmark of efficient, O(n) solutions.

For the Two Pointers pattern, which is highly applicable and frequently tested, here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write_index = 1
    for read_index in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read_index] != nums[read_index - 1]:
            nums[write_index] = nums[read_index]
            write_index += 1
    return write_index
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let writeIndex = 1;
  for (let readIndex = 1; readIndex < nums.length; readIndex++) {
    if (nums[readIndex] !== nums[readIndex - 1]) {
      nums[writeIndex] = nums[readIndex];
      writeIndex++;
    }
  }
  return writeIndex;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int writeIndex = 1;
    for (int readIndex = 1; readIndex < nums.length; readIndex++) {
        if (nums[readIndex] != nums[readIndex - 1]) {
            nums[writeIndex] = nums[readIndex];
            writeIndex++;
        }
    }
    return writeIndex;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key to covering the necessary ground without burnout.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Fundamentals**
Dedicate this phase to data structures. Each day, study one topic: Arrays & Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Hash Maps, and Basic Sorting. For each, solve 3-5 Easy problems on platforms like LeetCode or TidyBit, focusing on the patterns themselves (e.g., for Stacks, solve parentheses validation and stack-based queue problems). Implement solutions in your primary interview language until the syntax is automatic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Mastery**
Shift focus to algorithmic patterns. Prioritize the Two Pointers technique, Sliding Window, and basic Binary Search. Solve 2-3 Medium problems for each pattern. Simultaneously, practice 1-2 conceptual System Design exercises per week. For example, sketch the design for a hotel reservation system: identify core entities (Room, Booking), their relationships, and key operations (check availability, create booking).

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews**
In the final stretch, take full 60-90 minute practice sessions that mimic the real interview. Mix 1-2 Easy problems with 1 Medium problem. Use a timer. Practice explaining your thought process aloud as you code. Revisit all previously solved problems from the top topics (String, Stack, Design, Two Pointers) to ensure retention. In the last few days, focus on rest and reviewing your notes, not learning new material.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Readability and Edge Cases.** Odoo’s problems often model real-world data. Write clean, well-named code. Before you start coding, verbally confirm edge cases with your interviewer (empty input, large values, negative numbers). Explicitly handling these in your solution demonstrates professional thoroughness.
2.  **Communicate Your Design Decisions.** For System Design questions, talk through your trade-offs. Say, "I’m using a Stack here because we need LIFO order to match opening and closing tags," or "I’ll store users in a hash map for O(1) lookups." This shows you understand the _why_, not just the _how_.
3.  **Optimize Stepwise.** First, make it work. Provide a brute-force solution if necessary, then analyze its complexity. Next, make it better. Propose a more efficient approach (e.g., moving from O(n²) to O(n log n) with sorting or to O(n) with a hash map). This structured problem-solving is highly valued.
4.  **Know Odoo’s Context.** Briefly research what Odoo does—ERP, CRM, e-commerce platforms. While you won’t need deep product knowledge, understanding that they deal with business data, workflows, and UI modules can help you frame your solutions more relevantly during the interview.

Success in an Odoo coding interview is less about genius and more about consistent, disciplined practice of the right fundamentals. Master the patterns they test, communicate clearly, and write solid code.
