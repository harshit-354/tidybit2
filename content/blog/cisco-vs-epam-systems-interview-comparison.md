When preparing for technical interviews at Cisco and EPAM Systems, you'll find both similarities in core topics and clear differences in question volume and difficulty distribution. Cisco presents a larger, more challenging question bank (86 questions) with a significant hard problem component, while EPAM Systems offers a smaller, more moderate set (51 questions) with minimal emphasis on hard problems. Your preparation strategy should reflect these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

**Cisco** (86 questions: 22 Easy, 49 Medium, 15 Hard) demands broader and deeper preparation. The high volume of Medium questions suggests you must be proficient in applying standard algorithms to moderately complex scenarios. The notable presence of 15 Hard questions indicates you should also be ready for optimization challenges, multi-step logic, or less common algorithmic patterns. Expect a longer, more rigorous screening process.

**EPAM Systems** (51 questions: 19 Easy, 30 Medium, 2 Hard) focuses heavily on foundational and intermediate problem-solving. The vast majority of questions are Easy or Medium, testing core competency and clean implementation. The minimal number of Hard questions suggests the interview bar is set at reliably solving common problems correctly and efficiently, rather than tackling rare, highly complex algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize the same four fundamental topics: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Two Pointers**. This strong overlap means mastering these areas serves as efficient preparation for both.

- **Array & String:** Expect questions on traversal, manipulation, and searching. Sliding window and prefix sum techniques are highly relevant.
- **Hash Table:** Crucial for frequency counting and providing O(1) lookups to optimize solutions.
- **Two Pointers:** Essential for solving problems on sorted arrays/strings or for partitioning tasks.

Given the shared focus, proficiency in these topics is non-negotiable. Here is a typical Two Pointers problem you might encounter at either company:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **EPAM Systems first**. Its smaller question bank and concentration on Easy/Medium problems make it an ideal training ground. You can solidify your fundamentals in the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Two Pointers) by working through the EPAM list. This builds the reliable problem-solving muscle needed for most technical roles. Once comfortable, transition to **Cisco** preparation. Here, you'll expand your practice volume and deliberately tackle more Medium and Hard problems, which often require combining multiple techniques (e.g., Hash Table with Two Pointers) or implementing advanced data structures.

In short, use EPAM Systems to build a strong foundation in the shared core topics. Use Cisco to scale your skills upward in complexity and endurance. Mastering the EPAM question set will directly contribute to solving a significant portion of Cisco's easier problems, allowing you to then focus your efforts on Cisco's greater number of challenging questions.
