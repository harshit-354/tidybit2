Myntra’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including an initial online assessment (OA) with data structures and algorithms questions, followed by technical interviews that dive deep into your coding, debugging, and system design abilities. Success hinges on a targeted, pattern-based preparation strategy.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 24 Myntra coding questions reveals a clear focus on intermediate problem-solving. The distribution is: **Easy (4 questions, 17%), Medium (17 questions, 71%), and Hard (3 questions, 13%)**. This breakdown is critical for your preparation.

The overwhelming majority (71%) are Medium difficulty. This means Myntra prioritizes candidates who can reliably solve standard algorithmic challenges with optimal solutions. You won't be expected to solve obscure, complex graph theory puzzles every time, but you must flawlessly handle common patterns involving arrays, strings, and dynamic programming. The few Hard questions test your ability to break down a complex problem into manageable parts, often combining multiple patterns. Your goal should be to master Medium-level problems to a point of fluency, using them as a solid foundation to tackle the occasional Hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Prioritize these in your study plan.

- **Array (Top Topic):** Fundamental to almost all algorithms. Expect problems on subarrays, two-pointer techniques, and in-place manipulations.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Crucial for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, and duplicate detection.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator. Myntra frequently tests DP for optimization problems (e.g., knapsack variants, subsequences, pathfinding).
- **Sorting:** Often a preprocessing step for more efficient algorithms (like two-pointer) or the core of the problem itself (e.g., meeting intervals).
- **String:** Closely tied to array techniques. Focus on palindrome checks, anagrams, subsequence validation, and string transformations.

For Myntra, mastering the **Sliding Window** pattern for Array/String problems is essential, as it's a common optimization for subarray/substring questions. Here is a template for the variable-size sliding window pattern, used in problems like "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters":

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If duplicate found, move left pointer
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1
        # Update the character's latest index
        char_index[char] = right
        # Calculate window size
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestUniqueSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    // If duplicate found, move left pointer
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    // Update the character's latest index
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    // Calculate window size
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestUniqueSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        // If duplicate found, move left pointer
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        // Update the character's latest index
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        // Calculate window size
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused 4-6 week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Patterns.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. Don't just solve problems; internalize the patterns. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, DP, etc.), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Use a platform that categorizes by pattern (e.g., "Sliding Window," "Top-Down DP"). Write code for every problem in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Depth & Company-Specific Practice.** Dive deeper into Dynamic Programming, as it's a common stumbling block. Practice all major DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, LCS, LIS, unbounded knapsack, matrix DP). Then, shift to solving actual or similar **Myntra interview questions**. Time yourself. Practice explaining your thought process out loud as you code.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Solve problems without topic hints to simulate the actual interview. Participate in at least 5-10 mock interviews with peers or mentors. Focus on communication: state the brute force, explain the optimization, discuss time/space complexity, and handle edge cases gracefully. Revisit weak areas identified during mocks.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Never start typing in silence. Outline your approach, mention the brute force solution and its complexity, then explain your optimized plan (e.g., "I'll use a hash map to reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1)").
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Myntra evaluates code quality. Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, handle edge cases (empty input, single element), and write clean functions with proper signatures. Avoid messy, unreadable code.
3.  **Test with Your Own Examples.** After writing the code, don't just declare it done. Walk through a small test case, including edge cases, line-by-line. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches subtle bugs.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before solving, confirm assumptions about input (sorted?, limits?), output format, and edge cases. This shows you are a careful engineer and ensures you solve the right problem.
5.  **Practice Under Time Pressure.** Use a timer for every practice session. Myntra's interviews are timed; you need to build the muscle memory to analyze, code, and test within 30-45 minutes.

Mastering these patterns and honing your communication will give you a significant edge in Myntra's technical interviews. Consistent, focused practice on the right topics is the most reliable path to success.
