Revolut’s coding interviews are a direct test of practical problem-solving. The process typically involves an initial recruiter screen, followed by one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic questions and system design. The coding interviews are conducted via platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank, where you’ll write, run, and debug code in real-time. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication of your thought process.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent Revolut interview questions, the difficulty distribution is clear: 42% Easy, 58% Medium, and 0% Hard. This breakdown is highly revealing. Revolut is not focused on obscure, complex algorithms. Instead, they prioritize a strong, reliable grasp of fundamentals. The absence of Hard questions indicates they value correctness, clean implementation, and logical reasoning over solving esoteric puzzles. Your goal is to master medium-difficulty problems and execute them flawlessly under interview conditions.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Prioritize these areas in your preparation.

- **Array:** The most frequent data structure. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and two-pointer techniques.
- **String:** Often intertwined with array problems. Focus on manipulation, comparison, and sliding window patterns for substrings.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or matching pairs.
- **Linked List:** Tests pointer manipulation and cycle detection. Understand how to traverse, reverse, and merge lists.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, basic arithmetic, or simulation. Often simpler but require careful handling of edge cases.

For Revolut, the **Hash Table** pattern for frequency counting is arguably the most critical. It’s the foundation for solving a huge variety of array and string problems efficiently. Here is a classic example: determining if two strings are anagrams.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    for char in t:
        if char not in char_count or char_count[char] == 0:
            return False
        char_count[char] -= 1

    return True
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

  const charCount = new Map();
  for (const char of s) {
    charCount.set(char, (charCount.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }

  for (const char of t) {
    if (!charCount.has(char) || charCount.get(char) === 0) {
      return false;
    }
    charCount.set(char, charCount.get(char) - 1);
  }

  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

    int[] charCount = new int[26]; // For lowercase English letters
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        charCount[c - 'a']++;
    }

    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (charCount[c - 'a'] == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        charCount[c - 'a']--;
    }

    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key to covering the necessary ground without burnout.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate one day to each of the top five topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Linked List, Math). For each day, study the fundamental patterns (e.g., two-pointers for arrays, sliding window for strings) and solve 5-8 curated Easy and Medium problems. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter problems by company and topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Stop studying by topic. Start solving mixed problem sets that combine patterns. Focus exclusively on Medium difficulty. Begin doing timed practice sessions (45-60 minutes) to simulate the interview pressure. Write your code in a plain editor without auto-complete.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Refinement**
Solve every available Revolut-specific question you can find. This acclimates you to their problem style. Conduct at least 2-3 full mock interviews with a peer or mentor, focusing on articulating your approach before coding. Review and re-solve any problems where your initial solution was suboptimal or buggy.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Running Code Over Perfect Code.** Revolut interviews often use a live environment. A brute-force solution that runs is better than an optimal one with syntax errors. Get a working version first, then optimize if time permits.
2.  **Communicate Your Trade-offs.** When you choose a HashMap over an array, state why. Say, "This uses O(n) space but reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)." This demonstrates informed decision-making.
3.  **Ask Clarifying Questions Immediately.** Before writing a single line of code, confirm edge cases: "Can the input string be empty? Are the characters only lowercase?" This prevents major logic errors later.
4.  **Test Your Own Code.** After writing your solution, don't just rely on the platform's test runner. Verbally walk through a small test case with your code, including edge cases. This shows thoroughness and often catches bugs.

Success in Revolut's interviews comes from consistent, focused practice on the fundamentals. Master the core patterns, practice communicating your reasoning, and ensure your code is always executable.
