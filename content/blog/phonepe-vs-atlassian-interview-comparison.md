# PhonePe vs Atlassian: Interview Question Comparison

Preparing for technical interviews requires targeted study. PhonePe and Atlassian, while both assessing strong algorithmic fundamentals, present distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. Understanding these differences allows you to allocate your preparation time more effectively based on your target company and timeline.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a significant difference in the scale and challenge of their question banks.

**PhonePe** has a larger repository with **102 questions**, categorized as 63 Medium, 36 Hard, and only 3 Easy. This high density of Medium and Hard problems (over 97% combined) indicates a rigorous interview process focused on complex problem-solving. Expect to encounter multi-step algorithmic challenges that test optimization and edge-case handling.

**Atlassian** maintains a smaller, curated set of **62 questions**, with a notably different difficulty spread: 43 Medium, 12 Hard, and 7 Easy. The presence of Easy questions and a lower proportion of Hard problems (about 19% vs. PhonePe's 35%) suggests Atlassian's process may include more foundational screening or place a higher relative weight on system design and behavioral rounds for senior roles. The overall volume is more manageable for focused preparation.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures, but with subtle shifts in priority that reflect their engineering domains.

**Shared Core Focus:** Array, Hash Table, and Sorting are top topics for both. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays, using hash maps for efficient lookups, and applying standard sorting algorithms. These are non-negotiable fundamentals.

**PhonePe's Emphasis:** Dynamic Programming (DP) is a standout, appearing as a top-4 topic. This aligns with PhonePe's fintech focus, where optimal decision-making and optimization problems (e.g., transaction routing, resource allocation) are common. Mastering DP patterns like knapsack, LCS, or state machines is crucial.

```python
# Example DP problem (Coin Change)
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example DP problem (Coin Change)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  let dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (let coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example DP problem (Coin Change)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

**Atlassian's Emphasis:** String problems join the top list, reflecting the importance of text processing, parsing, and manipulation in collaboration and developer tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence). Be ready for problems involving string matching, transformation, and encoding.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your immediate goals and preparation style.

**Prepare for PhonePe first if:** You are aiming for roles demanding deep algorithmic expertise, are comfortable with a high volume of challenging problems, and need to solidify Dynamic Programming. Conquering PhonePe's question bank will build significant stamina and problem-solving rigor that translates well to other interviews, including Atlassian's core topics. It's the more intensive bootcamp.

**Prepare for Atlassian first if:** You are earlier in your interview preparation cycle or prefer a structured ramp-up. The smaller set with more foundational (Easy) questions allows you to solidify core concepts in Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings before tackling more complex problems. This foundation will then support you in tackling PhonePe's DP-heavy set. It's an efficient way to build confidence.

Ultimately, the strong overlap in Arrays, Hash Tables, and Sorting means preparation for one company significantly benefits the other. Prioritize based on which difficulty curve aligns with your current level and timeline.
