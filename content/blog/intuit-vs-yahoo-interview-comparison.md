When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly improve your efficiency. Intuit and Yahoo, while both established in the tech landscape, present distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks on TidyBit. Intuit's list is slightly larger and features a more challenging difficulty spread, whereas Yahoo's list is more accessible, especially for higher-level questions. This comparison breaks down the key differences in volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you prioritize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers reveal a clear initial difference in scope and challenge.

**Intuit** has a catalog of **71 questions**, categorized as 10 Easy, 47 Medium, and 14 Hard. This distribution indicates a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which are the core of most software engineering interviews. The notable presence of 14 Hard questions suggests Intuit's process may include complex problem-solving, often testing advanced algorithmic thinking or optimization under constraints.

**Yahoo** presents a list of **64 questions**, with a breakdown of 26 Easy, 32 Medium, and only 6 Hard. This profile is markedly more beginner-friendly. The high number of Easy questions and the relatively low count of Hard ones imply that Yahoo's interviews might focus more on foundational coding proficiency, clean implementation, and problem-solving on standard topics, rather than on highly esoteric or extreme optimization challenges.

In summary, Intuit's question set is both larger and skewed toward more difficult problems, while Yahoo's is more compact and weighted toward fundamentals.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test a core set of fundamental data structures and algorithms, but with subtle differences in emphasis.

The **top overlapping topics** are identical in the top three spots: **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String**. This is unsurprising, as these form the bedrock of most coding interviews. You can expect problems involving manipulation, searching, and relationship mapping within these structures.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common overlapping problem might involve arrays and hash tables.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common overlapping problem might involve arrays and hash tables.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: A common overlapping problem might involve arrays and hash tables.
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

The key difference lies in their fourth most frequent topic. **Intuit** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** prominently. This signals that you must prepare for problems involving optimization, memoization, and state transition, which are typically more challenging and require dedicated practice.

**Yahoo** lists **Sorting** as its fourth topic. This suggests a focus on problems where ordering data, using efficient comparison, or applying custom sort comparators is central. While DP can appear, the explicit topic ranking indicates it's less of a priority than at Intuit.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your interview timeline and the company's difficulty profile.

**Prepare for Yahoo first if you are earlier in your interview practice journey.** Its larger set of Easy questions and lower proportion of Hard problems makes it an excellent target for building confidence and reinforcing core concepts like array manipulation, hash table usage, and sorting algorithms. Mastering Yahoo's pattern will solidify the fundamentals needed for any interview.

**Prepare for Intuit first if you are already comfortable with core algorithms and need to level up.** The significant number of Medium and Hard questions, plus the explicit focus on Dynamic Programming, means Intuit's question bank is ideal for pushing your problem-solving skills to an advanced level. Succeeding here will likely mean you are well-prepared for Yahoo's challenges, but the reverse is not necessarily true.

A strategic approach is to use Yahoo's list for foundational drill and Intuit's list for advanced practice and depth, particularly in DP. Since the core topics (Array, Hash Table, String) overlap heavily, studying for one company inherently benefits preparation for the other.
