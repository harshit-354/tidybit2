Affirm’s technical interview process is designed to assess not just raw coding ability, but also your skill in building clear, scalable systems and communicating your thought process. The on-site loop typically involves a mix of algorithm-focused coding rounds and system design discussions, with a strong emphasis on practical, clean code that mirrors real-world engineering at the company.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent questions, the difficulty distribution is telling: 17% Easy, 58% Medium, and 25% Hard. This skew toward Medium and Hard problems means you must be exceptionally comfortable with core data structures and algorithms. The Easy questions often serve as warm-ups or test basic implementation skills, but the bulk of the interview will be at a level where you need to combine multiple concepts efficiently. The significant Hard portion indicates Affirm doesn’t shy away from complex problems, particularly in later interview stages or for senior roles, testing your ability to handle optimization and edge cases under pressure.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a clear study roadmap. Mastering these will cover the vast majority of problem scenarios you’ll encounter.

- **Hash Table:** The undisputed champion. Used for fast O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often paired with arrays or strings. Essential for problems involving counts, frequency, or mapping relationships.
- **String:** A close second. Expect manipulations, parsing, palindromes, and substring problems. Often combined with hash tables (for character counting) or two-pointer techniques.
- **Array:** Fundamental. Focus on techniques like two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, and in-place manipulations. Many array problems form the basis for more complex scenarios.
- **Design:** Reflects Affirm's product-focused engineering. Be ready for both low-level object-oriented design (e.g., designing a payment ledger) and high-level system design (e.g., designing a fraud detection service).
- **Sorting:** Rarely the final answer but a critical preprocessing step. Understanding _when_ to sort to enable a two-pointer or greedy solution is key.

Given that Hash Table is the top topic, the most important pattern is using it to achieve O(n) time complexity by trading space for time. A classic application is the **Two-Sum** problem, which is foundational.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{}; // No solution
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top four topics: Hash Table, String, Array, and Sorting. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, starting with Easy/Medium. Internalize the patterns from the code example above. Implement each solution from scratch.
- **Week 3: Pattern Integration & Design.** Move to problems that combine topics, like "Group Anagrams" (Hash Table + String Sorting). Begin studying design. Practice object-oriented design by outlining classes, relationships, and key methods for a simple system (e.g., a vending machine).
- **Week 4: Hard Problems & Mock Interviews.** Tackle 1-2 Hard problems daily. Don't just solve them—analyze why they are classified as Hard. Is it the time complexity constraint, the complex state management, or the non-obvious insight? Conduct at least 3-4 mock interviews with a timer and verbal explanation.
- **Weeks 5-6 (if available): Refinement & Company-Specific Prep.** Revisit mistakes from your problem log. Solve all available Affirm-tagged questions on platforms. Simulate full interview loops, including a system design round.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Trade-offs Explicitly.** When presenting a solution, start with a brute-force approach, then optimize. Always state the time and space complexity of your final solution and justify why the trade-off is acceptable. Say, "Using a hash table increases our space to O(n), but it reduces our time from O(n²) to O(n), which is optimal."
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Affirm values clean, maintainable code. Use descriptive variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, handle edge cases (empty input, large numbers), and consider writing helper functions for clarity. Don't just write code that passes tests; write code a colleague could easily understand.
3.  **Clarify Ambiguity Immediately.** Before coding, ask clarifying questions. For a design problem: "What are the primary use cases?" "What scale are we designing for?" For a coding problem: "Can the input contain duplicates?" "What should we return if there's no solution?" This shows systematic thinking.
4.  **Practice System Design Fundamentals.** Even for coding-focused roles, be prepared to discuss design at some level. Be comfortable discussing concepts like APIs, database schema, caching, and basic scalability in the context of financial products.

Success in Affirm interviews comes from a blend of pattern recognition, clean implementation, and clear communication. Target your preparation on the high-frequency topics, drill the patterns until they are automatic, and practice articulating your reasoning.
