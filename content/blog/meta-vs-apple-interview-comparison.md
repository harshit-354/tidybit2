When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can significantly streamline your preparation. Meta and Apple both test core computer science fundamentals, but their approach to interview questions differs in volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. A strategic candidate will tailor their study plan to these differences rather than using a generic approach.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of their respective question pools on platforms like TidyBit.

**Meta** presents a formidable challenge with **1387 questions**, categorized by difficulty:

- Easy: 414 questions
- Medium: 762 questions
- Hard: 211 questions

This large volume, with a heavy skew towards Medium-difficulty problems, reflects Meta's interview process, which often involves multiple coding rounds designed to assess problem-solving under pressure and the ability to handle complex, scalable scenarios. Preparing for Meta requires endurance and breadth.

**Apple**, in contrast, has a more focused list of **356 questions**:

- Easy: 100 questions
- Medium: 206 questions
- Hard: 50 questions

While still substantial, Apple's list is less than a third the size of Meta's. The difficulty distribution still emphasizes Medium questions, but the overall smaller pool suggests a greater likelihood of encountering known problems or close variants. Preparation can be more targeted, though depth on core topics remains critical.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are staples in interviews at both Meta and Apple. These form the essential toolkit for most coding challenges.

The key divergence appears in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Meta** lists **Math** as a top category. This often translates to problems involving number theory, combinatorics, or bit manipulation, which are common in domains like cryptography, systems design, and optimizing low-level operations.
- **Apple** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top category. This highlights Apple's focus on algorithmic optimization, efficient resource use, and elegant state management—skills highly relevant for system-level software, graphics, and battery-efficient applications on devices.

Consider a problem that could be approached with recursion or DP, like calculating the nth Fibonacci number. The optimal DP solution would be highly valued in an Apple interview context.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def fib_apple(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function fibApple(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int fibApple(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and timeline.

If you are interviewing with **both companies**, start with **Apple's list**. Its smaller, more focused set allows you to efficiently build core competency in the overlapping topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and gain crucial practice in Apple's highlighted area of Dynamic Programming. Mastering this list provides a strong foundation. You can then expand to **Meta's vast question bank**, treating it as advanced training to increase your speed, exposure to edge cases, and comfort with mathematical problems under time constraints.

If you are **only interviewing at one**, tailor your plan exclusively:

- For **Apple**: Deeply master the 356-question list. Prioritize Medium problems and ensure you can not only solve but also optimize DP and recursion problems.
- For **Meta**: Begin with the Easy and Medium problems from the core topics. Given the volume, focus on pattern recognition—practice grouping and solving problems by technique (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, BFS/DFS) rather than trying to memorize individual questions.

Ultimately, success at either company hinges on a genuine understanding of data structures and algorithms. Use the company-specific question lists to direct your practice, not as a substitute for foundational knowledge.
