When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study process. Adobe and Roblox, while both prominent in the tech landscape, present distinct interview profiles in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. This comparison breaks down their question banks to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of reported questions and their difficulty distribution is the most immediate difference.

**Adobe** has a large, well-documented question bank of **227 questions**. The difficulty breakdown is heavily weighted towards medium problems: 129 Medium (M), 68 Easy (E), and 30 Hard (H). This suggests a robust and predictable interview process where you can expect a solid mix of foundational and challenging problems, with a clear emphasis on the medium tier. Preparing for Adobe means being ready to solve a high volume of medium-difficulty algorithmic challenges under time constraints.

**Roblox**, in contrast, has a smaller, more concentrated bank of **56 questions**. The breakdown is 36 Medium (M), 8 Easy (E), and 12 Hard (H). Notably, the proportion of Hard questions is higher relative to its total size. This could indicate a more selective process where each question carries more weight, or an interview style that pushes candidates towards more complex problem-solving sooner. The smaller pool might mean less predictability but a sharper focus on core, challenging concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with subtle differences in priority.

The top topics are nearly identical: **Array, String, Hash Table** are top-three for both. This underscores their universal importance. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures, using hash tables for efficient lookups, and applying common patterns.

**Adobe's** fourth most frequent topic is **Two Pointers**, a specific algorithmic technique often used for problems involving sorted arrays or strings (e.g., finding pairs, removing duplicates, or checking palindromes). Its prominence signals a strong focus on efficient in-place array/string manipulation.

**Roblox's** fourth topic is **Math**. This points to a greater likelihood of numerical algorithms, problems involving number theory, probability, or other mathematical reasoning alongside coding.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common in Adobe)
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    s = list(s)
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return ''.join(s)

# Example: Math-focused (common in Roblox)
def is_power_of_two(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common in Adobe)
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  const arr = s.split("");
  while (left < right) {
    [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return arr.join("");
}

// Example: Math-focused (common in Roblox)
function isPowerOfTwo(n) {
  if (n <= 0) return false;
  return (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common in Adobe)
public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}

// Example: Math-focused (common in Roblox)
public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should depend on your goals and timeline.

If you are **new to technical interviews** or have more time, start with **Adobe**. Its larger bank of questions, with a strong medium-difficulty core, provides extensive practice on the most common patterns (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Two Pointers). Mastering these will build a formidable foundation applicable to almost any interview, including Roblox's. The volume allows for repeated exposure to core concepts.

If you are **short on time** or are already comfortable with medium-level problems and want to target Roblox specifically, you can start there. The smaller question bank is more manageable to cover comprehensively. However, be prepared to dive deep into the Hard questions and brush up on mathematical reasoning. The concentrated difficulty means you cannot afford weak spots in the fundamentals.

A strategic hybrid approach is to use **Adobe's extensive problem set for building core competency** and then **use Roblox's list for targeted, final-stage preparation** to acclimate to its particular difficulty weighting and math focus.
