Dynamic Programming (DP) is a decisive topic in technical interviews. It tests a candidate's ability to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems, optimize solutions, and think algorithmically. While challenging, mastering a few core patterns can transform DP from a weakness into a reliable strength.

## Common Patterns

Understanding these foundational patterns will help you tackle the majority of DP problems.

### 1. 0/1 Knapsack

This pattern involves making binary decisions: include an item or exclude it. The classic problem is: given items with weights and values, maximize value without exceeding a weight capacity.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i-1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

</div>

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

This pattern is used for comparing sequences (strings, arrays). The state `dp[i][j]` represents the LCS length of the first `i` chars of string A and first `j` chars of string B.

### 3. Fibonacci Sequence (1D DP)

This is the simplest DP pattern, where the next state depends on a fixed number of previous states. It's the basis for problems like climbing stairs or house robber.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

### 4. Matrix DP (2D Grid)

Problems involve moving through a grid (up/down/left/right). The state `dp[i][j]` typically represents the optimal solution to reach cell `(i, j)`.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 497 DP questions split as: **Easy: 12 (2%), Medium: 243 (49%), Hard: 242 (49%)**.

This distribution is critical. The near-equal split between Medium and Hard, with very few Easy problems, tells you two things. First, interviewers use DP to differentiate candidates. An "Easy" DP problem is often a straightforward application of a pattern (like Fibonacci). Second, you must be prepared for high complexity. A "Medium" problem might require identifying and implementing a known pattern with a twist. A "Hard" problem often combines multiple DP patterns or requires significant insight to define the state and transition.

## Which Companies Ask Dynamic Programming

Top companies frequently include DP in their interviews due to its effectiveness in assessing problem-solving depth.

- [Google](/company/google) often asks DP in later rounds for optimization problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) uses DP for problems related to system efficiency and resource allocation.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Meta](/company/meta) include DP in their coding screens for roles dealing with algorithms and data.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) frequently asks DP in financial and data-intensive problem contexts.

## Study Tips

1.  **Learn Patterns, Not Problems.** Memorizing hundreds of problems is futile. Focus on the 6-8 core patterns (like the ones above, plus others like Kadane's algorithm, Palindromic DP, and DP on Trees). Recognize the problem category first.
2.  **Master the State Definition.** The core of any DP solution is correctly defining `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]`. Ask: "What does this state represent?" Practice writing this down before writing any code.
3.  **Start with Top-Down (Memoization).** When solving a new problem, begin with a recursive brute-force solution, then add memoization. This approach is often more intuitive and mirrors the problem's definition. Convert it to a bottom-up (tabular) solution for optimization afterward.
4.  **Solve in Order of Difficulty.** Build confidence by solving all available Easy problems, then progress through Mediums grouped by pattern, before attempting Hards. This builds the logical muscles needed for complex state transitions.

Consistent, pattern-focused practice is the only way to build proficiency in Dynamic Programming.
