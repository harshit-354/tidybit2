Altimetrik’s technical interviews are designed to assess practical problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. The process typically involves one or two rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or through a live coding session. The emphasis is on writing clean, working code under time constraints, with a strong preference for efficient solutions.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Altimetrik's coding questions are distributed as follows: **Easy (50%)** and **Medium (50%)**. There are no Hard problems in their typical set. This breakdown is crucial for your preparation strategy. It means the interview is not about solving obscure, complex algorithms but about demonstrating **consistent accuracy and speed** on fundamental problems. You are expected to solve Easy questions flawlessly and quickly, leaving ample time to reason through and implement Medium-level solutions without major errors. Missing an edge case on an Easy problem can be more damaging than a slightly suboptimal Medium solution. The goal is to show you can write robust, production-ready code for common programming tasks.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are **Array, Hash Table, Counting, Math, and Two Pointers**. These often overlap in problems. Mastery here will cover the vast majority of questions you'll face.

- **Array & Two Pointers:** This is the most common combination. Problems often involve searching, partitioning, or comparing elements within an array. The two-pointer technique is the go-to for optimizing solutions that would otherwise require nested loops, especially for sorted arrays or problems dealing with pairs.
- **Hash Table & Counting:** This duo is fundamental for problems requiring frequency analysis, duplicate checks, or lookups. If a problem asks for "the first unique character," "two sum," or "majority element," a hash table (or dictionary/map) is almost always part of the optimal solution.
- **Math:** These are usually straightforward number manipulation problems (e.g., reverse an integer, check for palindrome, Armstrong numbers). The challenge is handling edge cases like integer overflow and negative numbers cleanly.

The most critical pattern to master is the **Two-Pointer technique on Arrays**, often combined with sorting. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # 'write' pointer places the next unique element
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    # 'write' index equals the new length
    return write
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A focused, consistent approach is more effective than cramming. Follow this plan:

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Dedicate this period to the top five topics. Solve 15-20 problems for each topic (Array/Hash Table/Two Pointers can be combined).
- For every problem, first attempt it yourself for 20-25 minutes. Then, study the optimal solution. Implement it again from scratch the next day.
- Focus on pattern recognition. For example, when you see "pair sum," immediately think "Hash Table" or "Two Pointers if sorted."

**Weeks 3-4: Speed & Problem Integration**

- Start doing timed practice sessions (30-45 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.
- Mix problems from all the core topics randomly. This trains you to quickly identify the correct data structure.
- Begin each coding session by verbally explaining your approach before writing any code. This mirrors the interview process.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Repair**

- Complete at least 4-5 full mock interviews (2 problems in 60 minutes). Use platforms that provide this service or practice with a peer.
- Analyze your mistakes. Create a list of your weak areas (e.g., off-by-one errors, missing null checks) and solve 5-10 related problems to drill them.
- In the final days, review and re-solve the most common Altimetrik problems you've practiced. Ensure you can code them flawlessly.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** Never go silent. Talk through your thought process as you analyze the problem, discuss potential approaches (and their trade-offs), and explain your code as you write it. This is as important as the code itself.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** Given the 50% Easy problem weight, a brute-force solution that works is often better than an optimal one you can't implement correctly under pressure. For Easy problems, get a working solution first, then optimize if time permits.
3.  **Master In-Place Operations:** Many array problems (like the duplicate removal example) ask for in-place modifications. Be very comfortable with techniques that use O(1) extra space by overwriting or swapping elements within the given data structure.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through standard tests (empty input, single element, large values) and problem-specific edge cases (negative numbers for math problems, all duplicates for array problems). Then, write a few of these as simple test cases in your editor.

Success in Altimetrik interviews comes from disciplined practice on their core topics and the ability to translate that practice into clear, communicative, and correct code under interview conditions.
