FactSet’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving skills with data. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic questions, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live coding environment. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and logical reasoning under time constraints. Understanding what they ask—and how often—is the first step to preparing effectively.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent FactSet coding questions reveals a clear pattern: **83% are of Medium difficulty, with the remaining 17% being Easy. Hard problems are virtually absent.** This distribution is crucial. It signals that FactSet is not trying to weed out candidates with obscure, complex algorithms. Instead, they are assessing a solid, practical foundation. Can you reliably solve common problems that involve string manipulation, array transformations, or designing a greedy approach? The absence of Hard problems means your study time is best spent mastering core patterns and achieving fluency, not diving into advanced graph theory or dynamic programming minutiae. The goal is consistency and correctness on standard challenges.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five recurring themes. Prioritize these.

1.  **String:** Expect problems involving parsing, validation, comparison, or transformation. Master two-pointer techniques and efficient character counting.
2.  **Stack:** A fundamental data structure for problems related to parsing, validation (like parentheses), and next-greater-element patterns.
3.  **Greedy:** Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each step to reach a global optimum. Common in scheduling or "minimum cost" problems.
4.  **Array:** The bread and butter. Focus on in-place operations, sliding window, prefix sums, and two-pointer techniques.
5.  **Monotonic Stack:** A specialized stack where elements are kept in a specific order (increasing or decreasing). This is the **most important pattern** for FactSet, as it efficiently solves a class of "next greater element" and "largest rectangle" problems that are interview staples.

The Monotonic Stack is a standout pattern. It maintains a stack where elements are ordered (typically monotonically decreasing) to allow O(n) solutions for problems that seem like they would require O(n²). Here is the classic "Next Greater Element" implementation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # Monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for i in range(n * 2):  # Handle circular array
        idx = i % n
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[idx]:
            prev_idx = stack.pop()
            result[prev_idx] = nums[idx]
        # Only push the index on its first pass
        if i < n:
            stack.append(idx)
    return result
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // Monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    // Handle circular array
    const idx = i % n;
    while (stack.length && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < nums[idx]) {
      const prevIdx = stack.pop();
      result[prevIdx] = nums[idx];
    }
    // Only push the index on its first pass
    if (i < n) {
      stack.push(idx);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) { // Handle circular array
        int idx = i % n;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[idx]) {
            int prevIdx = stack.pop();
            result[prevIdx] = nums[idx];
        }
        // Only push the index on its first pass
        if (i < n) {
            stack.push(idx);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan beats random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this time to the top five topics. For each topic (String, Stack, Greedy, Array, Monotonic Stack), solve 8-10 curated Medium problems. Use platforms that categorize by pattern. The goal is pattern recognition, not just solving.
- **Week 3: Integration & FactSet-Specific Practice.** Start mixing topics. Solve problems that combine patterns, like a Greedy approach on an Array. Actively seek out and solve problems tagged with "FactSet" or from known company question lists. Simulate a 45-minute time limit.
- **Week 4: Mock Interviews & Refinement.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using platform tools. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly before coding. Revisit any pattern where you feel hesitation.
- **Ongoing (Weeks 5-6 if needed):** Fill remaining gaps. If Arrays are solid but Greedy problems cause doubt, dedicate extra days to that single pattern. Polish your code for readability (meaningful variable names, consistent spacing).

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** When presented with a problem, verbally outline your approach, including time/space complexity. FactSet interviewers want to follow your logic. A silent coder is a red flag.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** With no Hard problems, a brute-force solution that works is often better than an attempted optimal one that fails. Start with a clear, working solution, then optimize if time allows.
3.  **Test Your Code Mentally.** Before declaring "done," walk through your code with a small, non-trivial test case, including edge cases (empty input, single element, sorted/reverse-sorted arrays). Mention this process to the interviewer.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language Inside-Out.** Be prepared to discuss the standard library for your language (e.g., `collections.deque` in Python for stacks, `ArrayDeque` in Java, built-in arrays in JavaScript). Use the right tool for the job.

Success in a FactSet coding interview is about disciplined preparation on the right material. Master the Medium-difficulty patterns, practice articulating your solutions, and you'll be well-equipped to perform.
