DoorDash’s technical interview is a focused test of your problem-solving and coding skills under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds of algorithm and data structure questions, often with a strong emphasis on real-world system design for more senior roles. Understanding what they prioritize is the first step to crafting an effective preparation strategy.

## By the Numbers

The reported data shows a clear emphasis on medium to hard problems. Out of 87 cataloged LeetCode questions, 51 are Medium (59%) and 30 are Hard (34%), with only 6 Easy (7%). This breakdown tells you two critical things. First, you must be exceptionally comfortable with Medium problems; they are the baseline and your performance here is non-negotiable. Second, the significant portion of Hard problems means you will likely encounter at least one complex challenge designed to test your depth. Your goal is to master Mediums to the point of fluency, then strategically tackle Hards to build the stamina and advanced thinking required for the final hurdle.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a direct roadmap for your study sessions.

**Array:** Expect manipulations, sorting, subarray problems, and two-pointer techniques. Many problems simulate real data logistics. A classic example is finding a contiguous subarray that meets a certain condition, such as having a sum equal to a target. The two-pointer technique is essential for solving problems with sorted arrays or when you need to track two indices simultaneously, like in the "Two Sum" problem when the input is sorted.

**Hash Table:** This is your primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Master using maps for frequency counting, memoization, and as a complement to other data structures. They are indispensable for problems where you need to check for the existence of an element quickly or store auxiliary information related to each input element. For instance, you can use a hash table to map a number to its index to solve the classic "Two Sum" problem in linear time.

**String:** Focus on parsing, manipulation, and sliding window algorithms. These often overlap with array techniques. String problems frequently involve checking for palindromes, finding substrings with specific properties (like the longest substring without repeating characters), or transforming one string into another. The sliding window technique is particularly powerful for substring problems where you need to maintain a dynamic view of a portion of the string.

**Depth-First Search (DFS):** Crucial for tree and graph traversal, pathfinding, and backtracking problems. Practice both recursive and iterative implementations. DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It's naturally implemented using recursion or an explicit stack. It's used in scenarios like finding a path in a maze, generating all possible permutations, or traversing a file system.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Essential for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and level-order traversals. Know when to use a queue for BFS over a stack for DFS. BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property makes it ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or printing a tree level by level.

Let's look at concrete implementations of DFS and BFS for traversing a graph represented as an adjacency list.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    result = []
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)
            # Add neighbors to stack; extend in reverse for standard order
            stack.extend(reversed(graph.get(node, [])))
    return result

def bfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    result = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return result

# Example graph: {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
print("DFS:", dfs_iterative(graph, 2))  # Output: DFS: [2, 0, 1, 3]
print("BFS:", bfs_iterative(graph, 2))  # Output: BFS: [2, 0, 3, 1]
```

```javascript
function dfsIterative(graph, start) {
  const visited = new Set();
  const stack = [start];
  const result = [];
  while (stack.length) {
    const node = stack.pop();
    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      visited.add(node);
      result.push(node);
      // Add neighbors to stack
      const neighbors = graph[node] || [];
      for (let i = neighbors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        stack.push(neighbors[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}

function bfsIterative(graph, start) {
  const visited = new Set([start]);
  const queue = [start];
  const result = [];
  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    result.push(node);
    const neighbors = graph[node] || [];
    for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        visited.add(neighbor);
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// Example graph: {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
const graph = { 0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3] };
console.log("DFS:", dfsIterative(graph, 2)); // Output: DFS: [2, 0, 1, 3]
console.log("BFS:", bfsIterative(graph, 2)); // Output: BFS: [2, 0, 3, 1]
```

```java

public class GraphTraversal {
    public static List<Integer> dfsIterative(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start) {
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();

## Preparation Strategy

A targeted 4-6 week plan is more effective than months of unstructured study.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Solidify the top five topics. For each, solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on pattern recognition, not just solutions. Ensure you can implement standard algorithms for DFS/BFS from memory. For example, when studying arrays, practice problems like "Product of Array Except Self" or "Maximum Subarray." For hash tables, solve "Group Anagrams" or "Longest Consecutive Sequence." Implement these patterns from scratch without looking at solutions.

**Weeks 3-4: Intensity & Depth.** Shift to mixed-topic practice and introduce Hard problems. Aim for 2-3 problems daily, simulating a 45-minute time limit. Dedicate specific days to common DoorDash problem domains, like delivery route simulation (graph algorithms) or order matching (arrays/hash tables). A typical graph problem might involve finding the shortest delivery route given a map of locations and roads (edges). This can be solved with BFS for unweighted graphs or Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted ones. Let's implement a basic BFS shortest path in an unweighted graph.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return [start]
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])  # (node, path)
    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor == end:
                return path + [neighbor]
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    return []  # No path found

# Example: Graph of locations
# 0 -> 1, 2
# 1 -> 0, 3
# 2 -> 0, 3
# 3 -> 1, 2, 4
# 4 -> 3
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 3], 2: [0, 3], 3: [1, 2, 4], 4: [3]}
print("Shortest path from 0 to 4:", shortest_path_bfs(graph, 0, 4))
# Output: Shortest path from 0 to 4: [0, 1, 3, 4] or [0, 2, 3, 4]
```

```javascript
function shortestPathBFS(graph, start, end) {
  if (start === end) return [start];
  const visited = new Set([start]);
  const queue = [[start, [start]]]; // [node, path]
  while (queue.length) {
    const [node, path] = queue.shift();
    const neighbors = graph[node] || [];
    for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
      if (neighbor === end) return [...path, neighbor];
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        visited.add(neighbor);
        queue.push([neighbor, [...path, neighbor]]);
      }
    }
  }
  return []; // No path found
}

// Example graph
const graph = { 0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 3], 2: [0, 3], 3: [1, 2, 4], 4: [3] };
console.log("Shortest path from 0 to 4:", shortestPathBFS(graph, 0, 4));
// Output: [0, 1, 3, 4] or [0, 2, 3, 4]
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ShortestPathBFS {
    public static List<Integer> shortestPathBFS(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) return Arrays.asList(start);
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<Integer, List<Integer>>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        visited.add(start);
        queue.offer(new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(start, Arrays.asList(start)));
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<Integer, List<Integer>> entry = queue.poll();
            int node = entry.getKey();
            List<Integer> path = entry.getValue();
            for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (neighbor == end) {
                    List<Integer> newPath = new ArrayList<>(path);
                    newPath.add(neighbor);
                    return newPath;
                }
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    List<Integer> newPath = new ArrayList<>(path);
                    newPath.add(neighbor);
                    queue.offer(new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(neighbor, newPath));
                }
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(); // No path found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        graph.put(0, Arrays.asList(1, 2));
        graph.put(1, Arrays.asList(0, 3));
        graph.put(2, Arrays.asList(0, 3));
        graph.put(3, Arrays.asList(1, 2, 4));
        graph.put(4, Arrays.asList(3));
        System.out.println("Shortest path from 0 to 4: " + shortestPathBFS(graph, 0, 4));
        // Output: [0, 1, 3, 4] or [0, 2, 3, 4]
    }
}
```

</div>

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Review.** Conduct full mock interviews (2-3 problems back-to-back). Revisit every problem you struggled with. Systematically practice explaining your thought process aloud while coding, as communication is a scored component. Record yourself solving a problem and watch it back to critique your explanation clarity and pacing.

## Key Tips

1. **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, complexity, and trade-offs. Ask clarifying questions. Treat the interview as a collaborative session. For example, if given a problem like "Find the k most frequent elements," you might say: "I'm considering two approaches. First, a brute-force method would count frequencies with a hash map, sort the items by frequency, and take the top k. That would be O(n log n) time. A more optimal approach might use the hash map for counts and then a min-heap of size k to track the top k elements, which would be O(n log k). For large n and small k, the heap is better. I'll implement the heap approach."

2. **Optimize Incrementally.** For Medium problems, often a brute-force solution is a starting point. State it, then improve it. This demonstrates structured problem-solving better than jumping straight to an optimal solution you can't fully derive. Let's see this in action with the "Two Sum" problem. The brute-force solution checks every pair. The optimal solution uses a hash map for O(n) time.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_brute_force(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    return []

def two_sum_optimal(nums, target):
    num_to_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        num_to_index[num] = i
    return []

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print("Brute force:", two_sum_brute_force(nums, target))
print("Optimal:", two_sum_optimal(nums, target))
```

```javascript
function twoSumBruteForce(nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
  return [];
}

function twoSumOptimal(nums, target) {
  const numToIndex = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numToIndex.has(complement)) {
      return [numToIndex.get(complement), i];
    }
    numToIndex.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log("Brute force:", twoSumBruteForce(nums, target));
console.log("Optimal:", twoSumOptimal(nums, target));
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TwoSum {
    public static int[] twoSumBruteForce(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }

    public static int[] twoSumOptimal(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numToIndex = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numToIndex.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{numToIndex.get(complement), i};
            }
            numToIndex.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
        int target = 9;
        System.out.println("Brute force: " + Arrays.toString(twoSumBruteForce(nums, target)));
        System.out.println("Optimal: " + Arrays.toString(twoSumOptimal(nums, target)));
    }
}
```

3. **Test Your Code.** Always run through a small example with edge cases (empty input, single element, large values) after writing your solution. This catches logical errors and shows attention to detail. For instance, if your function takes an array, test with `[]`, `[1]`, `[1,1]`, and `[large negative, large positive]`. Write these test cases as comments or simple assertions.

4. **Practice with Constraints.** Many DoorDash problems involve spatial or temporal limits (delivery windows, driver locations). Get comfortable translating these business constraints into code conditions. For example, a problem might state: "Given a list of delivery orders with preparation times and delivery deadlines, determine the maximum number of orders that can be fulfilled." This translates to an interval scheduling or greedy selection problem. Practice recognizing these real-world patterns.

Success requires a blend of strategic topic focus, consistent timed practice, and clear communication. The data gives you the blueprint; your execution turns it into an offer.
