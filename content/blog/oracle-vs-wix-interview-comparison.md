When preparing for technical interviews, the volume and nature of questions you'll face can vary dramatically between a legacy enterprise giant like Oracle and a modern web-focused company like Wix. Understanding these differences is crucial for efficient study. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you target your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of preparation differs significantly. Oracle's list, with **340 questions**, is over six times larger than Wix's **56 questions**. This volume reflects Oracle's broader range of products, from databases to cloud infrastructure, which demands a more extensive and deep assessment of algorithmic knowledge.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Oracle (E70/M205/H65)**: The profile is heavily weighted toward **Medium (205 questions)**, with a substantial number of **Hard (65)** problems. This indicates an interview process that rigorously tests the application of core concepts in complex scenarios. The high number of Medium questions is typical for large tech companies screening for strong foundational skills.
- **Wix (E16/M31/H9)**: The distribution is more balanced relative to its size, but still leans toward **Medium (31 questions)**. The number of **Hard (9)** problems is notably smaller. This suggests a focus on practical problem-solving ability over solving the most esoteric algorithmic puzzles, which aligns with Wix's product-centric, web development focus.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with a key divergence.

**Common Ground (Array, String, Hash Table):** These are the absolute essentials. Proficiency here is non-negotiable for interviews at either company. You must be able to manipulate arrays and strings efficiently and know when to leverage a hash table for O(1) lookups.

```python
# Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

**Key Divergence:**

- **Oracle** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a core topic. This aligns with its difficulty profile; DP problems are often categorized as Medium or Hard. Expect questions that require optimizing overlapping subproblems, like classic knapsack, longest common subsequence, or pathfinding problems.
- **Wix** lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)** as a core topic. This is highly relevant for web development, where traversing tree structures (like the DOM) or graph-like data (component hierarchies) is common. You should be comfortable with both recursive and iterative implementations for trees and graphs.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS on a binary tree (recursive)
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order traversal
    print(node.val)
    dfs(node.left)
    dfs(node.right)
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS on a binary tree (recursive)
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order traversal
  console.log(node.val);
  dfs(node.left);
  dfs(node.right);
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS on a binary tree (recursive)
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Pre-order traversal
    System.out.println(node.val);
    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your priorities and timeline.

**Prepare for Wix first if:** You are earlier in your interview preparation journey or are specifically targeting front-end or full-stack web roles. The smaller question bank and lower emphasis on notoriously difficult topics like DP make it a more focused and manageable first target. Mastering the shared fundamentals (Array, String, Hash Table) and DFS will cover a large portion of their question pool.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You are preparing for a broad array of software engineering roles, have more time, or want to tackle a more comprehensive curriculum. Conquering Oracle's list, with its heavy emphasis on Medium problems and DP, will inherently prepare you for the vast majority of problems you'd see in a Wix interview. The reverse is not true; skipping DP study would leave a significant gap for Oracle.

In essence, preparing for Oracle is a superset of preparing for Wix. If your goal is general readiness, start with the Oracle pattern. If you need a focused, quicker win for a web company, start with Wix.
