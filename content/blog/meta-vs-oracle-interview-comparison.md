When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Meta and Oracle, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct challenges in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation to these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of Meta's question bank is its most defining feature. With **1,387** cataloged questions, it dwarfs Oracle's **340**. This volume reflects Meta's intense, broad-scope interview process, which often involves multiple coding rounds.

More telling is the difficulty breakdown. Meta's distribution (**414 Easy, 762 Medium, 211 Hard**) reveals a heavy, deliberate focus on **Medium-difficulty problems**. These questions are the core of their interviews, designed to test not just correctness but optimal approach, clean code, and communication under pressure. The significant number of Hards indicates you must be prepared for at least one highly complex problem.

Oracle's distribution (**70 Easy, 205 Medium, 65 Hard**) shows a similar emphasis on Medium-difficulty questions as the primary filter. However, the proportion of Hard questions relative to the total bank is slightly higher than Meta's (19% vs 15%). This suggests that while Oracle's overall process may involve fewer questions, the ones you do encounter can be deeply challenging. The smaller total volume means question repetition in interviews is somewhat more likely.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are central to both question banks. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews and are essential to master.

The key divergence is in their secondary focus areas:

- **Meta** lists **Math** as a top topic. This often translates to problems involving number theory, probability, or clever computational tricks, requiring flexible mathematical thinking.
- **Oracle** highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. This signals a strong expectation that candidates can solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems. DP is a frequent and challenging hurdle in Oracle interviews.

This difference in emphasis should guide your deep-dive study. For Meta, ensure you are comfortable with mathematical algorithms. For Oracle, a rigorous review of classic DP patterns—like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings—is non-negotiable.

```python
# Example of a Math-focused pattern (Fast Modular Exponentiation)
def pow_mod(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    base = base % mod
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exp = exp >> 1
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result

# Example of a DP pattern (0/1 Knapsack)
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        for w in range(capacity, weights[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i])
    return dp[capacity]
```

```javascript
// Example of a Math-focused pattern (Fast Modular Exponentiation)
function powMod(base, exp, mod) {
  let result = 1n;
  base = base % mod;
  let b = BigInt(base),
    e = BigInt(exp),
    m = BigInt(mod);
  while (e > 0) {
    if (e % 2n === 1n) {
      result = (result * b) % m;
    }
    e = e >> 1n;
    b = (b * b) % m;
  }
  return Number(result);
}

// Example of a DP pattern (0/1 Knapsack)
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const dp = new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
    for (let w = capacity; w >= weights[i]; w--) {
      dp[w] = Math.max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
    }
  }
  return dp[capacity];
}
```

```java
// Example of a Math-focused pattern (Fast Modular Exponentiation)
public int powMod(int base, int exp, int mod) {
    int result = 1;
    base = base % mod;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if ((exp & 1) == 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        exp >>= 1;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
    }
    return result;
}

// Example of a DP pattern (0/1 Knapsack)
public int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
    int[] dp = new int[capacity + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        for (int w = capacity; w >= weights[i]; w--) {
            dp[w] = Math.max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
        }
    }
    return dp[capacity];
}

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Grind problems on **Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables** from a general platform like LeetCode. This core competency serves both companies equally.

If you are interviewing for **Meta**, prepare for breadth and stamina. You must be able to reliably solve a high volume of Medium problems. Use Meta's vast question bank for pattern recognition, but don't try to memorize it. Prioritize the top 100-150 most frequent questions. Integrate mathematical problem-solving practice.

If you are interviewing for **Oracle**, prepare for depth. Master the core topics, then dedicate significant time to **Dynamic Programming**. Practice deriving the DP state and transition from scratch. Their smaller question bank allows for more comprehensive review, but the difficulty ceiling is high.

Ultimately, Meta's process tests for consistent, high-performance problem-solving across a wide range, while Oracle's often probes deeper into specific, complex algorithmic domains like DP.
