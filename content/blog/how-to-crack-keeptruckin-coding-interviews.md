Keeptruckin’s coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving skills relevant to logistics and fleet management. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds assessing core data structure and algorithm knowledge, with an emphasis on clean, efficient code. Expect questions that model real-world data processing—tracking vehicle routes, managing time intervals, or analyzing sequences—all within a standard 45-60 minute session.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Keeptruckin’s coding questions break down as follows: 25% Easy, 75% Medium, and 0% Hard. This distribution is telling. The absence of Hard problems indicates the interview is not designed to test obscure algorithmic knowledge or complex graph theory. Instead, it assesses your ability to reliably solve common, high-frequency problems under time constraints. The 75% Medium weighting is critical—it means you must be exceptionally proficient with core patterns. Success hinges on quickly recognizing and implementing solutions for problems involving arrays, strings, and hash tables with optimal time complexity. You cannot afford to stumble on Medium-level questions.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Sorting, String, Hash Table, and Prefix Sum. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array & Hash Table:** These are almost always used together. The hash table (dictionary/map) is the primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups to avoid O(n²) nested loops on array problems. Think: two-sum, finding duplicates, or checking for complements.
- **Sorting:** Many array problems become tractable once sorted. Two-pointer techniques on sorted arrays are a common follow-up for finding pairs, removing duplicates, or merging intervals.
- **String:** Often treated as a character array. Key techniques include two-pointer reversal, sliding windows for substrings, and using hash tables for character frequency counts (anagrams, longest substring without repeating characters).
- **Prefix Sum:** A crucial pattern for problems involving subarray sums. By pre-computing cumulative sums, you can calculate the sum of any subarray in O(1) time, which is essential for meeting optimal time limits on Medium problems.

The most important combined pattern is using a **Hash Table with Prefix Sum**. This solves a whole class of "subarray sum equals K" problems efficiently. The brute-force method is O(n²). The optimal O(n) approach uses a hash map to store prefix sums as you iterate, allowing you to check if the needed complement sum has already been seen.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarraySum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    sum_map = {0: 1}  # prefix sum 0 occurred once initially

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # Check if (prefix_sum - k) exists in our map
        count += sum_map.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Record the current prefix sum
        sum_map[prefix_sum] = sum_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumMap = new Map();
  sumMap.set(0, 1); // prefix sum 0 occurred once initially

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    // Check if (prefixSum - k) exists in our map
    if (sumMap.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumMap.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    // Record the current prefix sum
    sumMap.set(prefixSum, (sumMap.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>();
    sumMap.put(0, 1); // prefix sum 0 occurred once initially

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        // Check if (prefixSum - k) exists in our map
        count += sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        // Record the current prefix sum
        sumMap.put(prefixSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, pattern-based plan is essential given the topic concentration.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Drill the top 5 topics exclusively. For each, learn the 2-3 most common patterns.
- **Arrays/Hash Tables:** Practice two-sum, contains duplicate, and intersection problems.
- **Sorting:** Master two-pointer techniques for pair-sum and overlap problems.
- **Strings:** Practice sliding window and character counting.
- **Prefix Sum:** Implement the basic pattern and the hash map variant shown above. Solve at least 5 problems using it.

**Weeks 3-4: Medium Problem Mastery**

- Solve only Medium difficulty problems that combine the core topics (e.g., an array problem requiring sorting and a hash table).
- Time yourself strictly (30 minutes per problem). Focus on identifying the pattern within the first 5 minutes of reading.
- Practice explaining your reasoning out loud as you code.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Review**

- Complete at least 4-6 full mock interviews using Keeptruckin-style questions (Medium-focused, array/string heavy).
- Revisit every problem you struggled with. Ensure you can code the optimal solution from memory without hesitation.
- In the final days, focus on clean code structure and edge case handling.

## Key Tips

1.  **Pattern Recognition Over Memorization:** When you read a problem, immediately ask: "Is this a prefix sum problem? A sliding window? A two-pointer on a sorted array?" Your goal is to map the question to a known pattern within seconds.
2.  **Communicate Your Process:** Before coding, state the brute-force approach and its complexity, then explain the optimized pattern you'll use and why it's better. This demonstrates systematic thinking.
3.  **Prioritize Correctness First:** Write a working, brute-force solution if the optimal one isn't immediately clear. Then, iterate to optimize. A correct suboptimal solution is better than an incomplete optimal one.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Before declaring done, verbally run through small inputs, empty arrays, single elements, and large values. This catches off-by-one errors and null pointer issues.

The Keeptruckin interview is a test of consistent, practical skill. By drilling the specific patterns in their question pool, you build the muscle memory to succeed under pressure.
