MakeMyTrip’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including a technical phone screen and on-site (or virtual) interviews focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design. Success hinges on targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 24 recent MakeMyTrip coding questions reveals a clear, challenging trend: **0% Easy, 71% Medium, and 29% Hard**. This distribution is significant. It tells you that MakeMyTrip does not waste time on trivial warm-up problems. You are expected to hit the ground running with intermediate to advanced algorithmic challenges from the start. The absence of Easy questions means your fundamentals must be rock-solid; there is no room for hesitation on basic concepts. The high proportion of Medium problems forms the core of the interview, testing your fluency with common patterns and your ability to implement optimal solutions. The substantial 29% Hard questions indicate they are serious about identifying top-tier candidates who can handle complex optimization and edge cases. Your preparation must be geared towards this level of difficulty.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights four critical areas. Master these to cover the vast majority of problems you'll encounter.

- **Array & String:** These are the fundamental data structures for most algorithmic problems. Expect manipulations, searches, and transformations.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A major topic for Hard problems. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in scenarios like maximizing profit, minimizing cost, or counting ways.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or checking for existence.
- **Sliding Window:** A crucial technique for optimizing problems on arrays/strings where you need to find a subarray/substring satisfying certain conditions, often involving a "window" that expands and contracts.

Given that **Sliding Window** is a highly effective pattern for Array/String problems—two of the top topics—it's a pattern you must know cold. Here is a classic example: finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}  # Hash map to store the most recent index of each character
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # If char is in map and its index is within our current window
        if s[right] in char_index and char_index[s[right]] >= left:
            left = char_index[s[right]] + 1  # Slide left side of window
        char_index[s[right]] = right  # Update the character's latest index
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLength;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

</div>

This pattern combines **Sliding Window** (via the `left` and `right` pointers) with a **Hash Table** (`charIndex`) for instant lookups, perfectly illustrating how top topics are often tested together.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable given the difficulty level.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Patterns.** Do not skip this. Systematically review all essential data structures (Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Sets, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Trees, Graphs) and algorithm paradigms. Dedicate days to mastering each of the top patterns: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Fast & Slow Pointers, and the fundamentals of Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci, 0/1 Knapsack).

**Weeks 3-4: Topic-Focused Deep Dive.** This is your main battle phase. Cycle through the top topics identified: Array, String, Dynamic Programming, Hash Table. For each topic, solve 15-20 problems, mixing Medium and Hard. On DP days, start with classic problems (Longest Increasing Subsequence, Coin Change) before moving to more complex ones. Use platforms that allow you to filter by company and topic.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Problem Synthesis.** Simulate the real environment. Conduct at least 2-3 mock interviews per week, aiming to solve two Medium or one Hard problem in 45 minutes. Actively seek out problems that combine multiple patterns (e.g., a DP problem that uses a Hash Table for memoization, or an Array problem solved with a Sliding Window). This phase is about building stamina and the ability to deconstruct a novel problem into familiar components under time pressure.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, time/space complexity, and consider edge cases. Interviewers evaluate your thought process as much as your final code.
2.  **Optimize Relentlessly.** A brute-force solution is rarely sufficient. Always ask, "Can this be done with a hash map?" or "Is there a DP relationship?" Your first solution should be at least optimal in theory (O(n log n) or better for Medium/Hard).
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include clear comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, large values). Write a few test cases verbally to demonstrate testing rigor.
4.  **Practice with Time Constraints.** Set a 25-minute timer for Medium problems and a 40-minute timer for Hards. This builds the pace you need for the actual interview where you must also explain your thinking.

Targeted, disciplined practice on the right patterns at the right difficulty level is your formula for success.
