When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and eBay represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum—one a massive global services firm and the other a focused e-commerce tech company. Their question banks on TidyBit reflect this difference, with TCS's list being significantly larger and broader, while eBay's is more compact and concentrated. A strategic comparison helps candidates prioritize their preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. TCS's list contains **217 questions**, dwarfing eBay's **60 questions**. This volume suggests TCS's interview process may draw from a wider pool of problems or involve more technical screening stages.

The difficulty distribution also reveals contrasting profiles:

- **TCS:** Easy: 94 (43%), Medium: 103 (47%), Hard: 20 (9%)
- **eBay:** Easy: 12 (20%), Medium: 38 (63%), Hard: 10 (17%)

TCS's distribution is more balanced, with a slight emphasis on Medium problems. The high number of Easy questions indicates a strong focus on foundational coding ability. eBay's distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty, with a notable percentage of Hard problems. This suggests eBay's interviews prioritize problem-solving depth and complexity over sheer breadth of fundamental topics.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, as seen in their shared top topics: **Array, String, Hash Table**. This is the essential foundation for any interview preparation.

- **TCS** includes **Two Pointers** as a primary topic. This is a critical technique for solving problems involving arrays and strings efficiently (e.g., finding pairs, palindromes, or merging sorted arrays).
- **eBay** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic. This indicates a focus on algorithms that involve ordering data, which is fundamental for search, ranking, and optimization problems common in e-commerce platforms.

The overlap means mastering Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables will benefit you for both companies. However, you should tailor your deeper practice:

- For **TCS**, ensure proficiency with the Two Pointers technique.
- For **EBay**, drill into sorting algorithms (like QuickSort, MergeSort) and their applications.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (Relevant for TCS)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Example: Sorting Application (Relevant for eBay)
def meeting_rooms(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (Relevant for TCS)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Sorting Application (Relevant for eBay)
function canAttendMeetings(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (Relevant for TCS)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Example: Sorting Application (Relevant for eBay)
public boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **eBay first**. Its focused list of 60 questions, dominated by Medium difficulty, allows for a deep, concentrated study session. You can thoroughly master the core topics and the specific emphasis on sorting algorithms. This builds a strong foundation in complex problem-solving.

After tackling eBay's list, move to **TCS**. The vast question bank will then feel like an extension of your preparation. You can efficiently work through the many Easy and Medium problems, solidifying fundamentals and adding the Two Pointers technique to your toolkit. The prior deep work for eBay will make the breadth of TCS's list less daunting.

This strategy maximizes efficiency: depth-first with eBay to build robust skills, then breadth-first with TCS to reinforce and expand them.
