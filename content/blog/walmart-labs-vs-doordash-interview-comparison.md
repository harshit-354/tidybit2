When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study. Walmart Labs and DoorDash, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and favored topics. This comparison breaks down their interview landscapes to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a clear difference in the breadth of documented questions. Walmart Labs has a larger public repository with **152 questions**, categorized as Easy (22), Medium (105), and Hard (25). This suggests a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which form the core of their technical screens and on-site interviews. The high volume indicates a wide variety of problems you might encounter, making pattern recognition crucial.

DoorDash's list is more concentrated at **87 questions**, with a distribution of Easy (6), Medium (51), and Hard (30). Notably, DoorDash has a **higher proportion of Hard problems** (≈34%) compared to Walmart Labs (≈16%). This points to DoorDash interviews potentially delving deeper into complex algorithmic challenges, especially in later rounds.

**Key Takeaway:** For Walmart Labs, mastering a wide range of Medium problems is essential. For DoorDash, you must be equally prepared to tackle tough, intricate Hard problems after solidifying Medium fundamentals.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are foundational at both. This is where you'll find questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and frequency counting.

The primary divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Walmart Labs shows a significant focus on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a topic often associated with medium-to-hard optimization problems. DoorDash, conversely, lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, indicating a greater emphasis on graph and tree traversal problems, which are common in modeling real-world logistics and mapping scenarios.

Here’s a quick example illustrating a classic problem type for each company's distinctive focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Walmart Labs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Coin Change)
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Walmart Labs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Coin Change)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Walmart Labs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Coin Change)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```python
# DoorDash Focus: Depth-First Search (Number of Islands)
def numIslands(grid):
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or grid[r][c] != '1':
            return

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Grind problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Master two-pointers, sliding windows, and subarray techniques. This core is non-negotiable for both.

If your goal is to interview at **Walmart Labs**, prioritize this core and then dedicate substantial time to **Dynamic Programming**. Practice all major DP patterns: 0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack (coin change), longest common subsequence, and matrix traversal.

If your target is **DoorDash**, after the core, shift your focus to **graph and tree algorithms**. Practice DFS, BFS, cycle detection, topological sort, and shortest path algorithms. Be prepared to solve Hard problems that combine these concepts with other data structures.

Ultimately, preparing for one will significantly aid you for the other due to the large overlap. The strategic difference lies in where you place your deep-dive emphasis: DP for Walmart Labs, and graph DFS for DoorDash.
