When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each can significantly streamline your preparation. Oracle and Cisco, while both being established technology giants, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics. This comparison breaks down their coding interview patterns to help you prioritize your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of their question banks. Oracle's list is substantially larger, with **340 total questions** categorized by difficulty: 70 Easy, 205 Medium, and 65 Hard. This volume suggests a broader pool of potential problems and indicates that Oracle's interviews may draw from a wide array of concepts, with a pronounced emphasis on **Medium-difficulty challenges**.

In contrast, Cisco's list is more focused, with **86 total questions**: 22 Easy, 49 Medium, and 15 Hard. The distribution still leans towards Medium, but the overall smaller bank implies a more predictable or narrower scope. For a candidate, this means preparing for Cisco could be a more manageable task, while preparing for Oracle requires covering more ground to account for greater variability.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the common core for both Oracle and Cisco interviews. These are essential building blocks for more complex algorithms.

The key divergence is in the next layer of topics. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a significant component for Oracle, as indicated by its topic list and the presence of Hard questions. DP problems often require substantial practice to master. Cisco's listed topics include **Two Pointers**, a technique frequently applied to Array and String problems (like finding palindromes or pair sums), which is generally considered more approachable than DP.

Here’s a typical Two Pointers problem, common for Cisco:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

An example of a Dynamic Programming problem more likely for Oracle:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your timeline and the companies' requirements.

**Prepare for Cisco first if:** You are new to technical interviews or have a shorter timeline. The smaller, more focused question bank allows you to build confidence by mastering core topics (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Two Pointers) without immediately tackling the depth of Dynamic Programming. Success here solidifies your fundamentals.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You have more time or are already comfortable with core data structures and algorithms. Tackling Oracle's larger bank, especially its Medium and Hard Dynamic Programming questions, will provide rigorous training. This deep preparation inherently covers the foundational topics needed for Cisco, making subsequent Cisco preparation largely a review of a subset of what you've already studied.

In essence, Cisco's interview can be seen as a solid benchmark for core competency, while Oracle's demands a broader and deeper algorithmic mastery. A strong strategy is to master the common core, then layer on Oracle-specific topics like DP.
