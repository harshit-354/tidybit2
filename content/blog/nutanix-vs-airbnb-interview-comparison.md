When preparing for technical interviews at different companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly improve your efficiency. Nutanix and Airbnb, while both testing core computer science fundamentals, show distinct differences in their interview question distributions and emphasis. This comparison analyzes their LeetCode question distributions to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Nutanix has 68 tagged questions on LeetCode with a distribution of 68% Easy, 24% Medium, and 8% Hard (E46/M16/H6). This indicates a strong focus on assessing fundamental problem-solving skills and coding clarity, with a clear majority of questions being accessible. The relatively lower proportion of Hard questions suggests interviews may prioritize correctness, clean code, and logical reasoning on well-known patterns over solving extremely complex, novel problems.

Airbnb has 64 tagged questions with a distribution of 58% Easy, 34% Medium, and 8% Hard (E37/M22/H5). Compared to Nutanix, Airbnb places a noticeably higher weight on Medium-difficulty problems. This shift suggests their interviews might involve a greater number of problems that require combining multiple concepts or applying standard algorithms to moderately tricky scenarios. The similar proportion of Hard questions indicates both companies include a few challenging problems, likely to evaluate depth of knowledge and performance under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** manipulations. These form the essential toolkit for most coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Nutanix** shows a higher frequency of **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This points to an emphasis on tree and graph traversal problems, which test recursive thinking, backtracking, and systematic exploration of state spaces.
- **Airbnb** shows a higher frequency of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This indicates a focus on optimization problems, breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems, and often involves string or array manipulation.

This difference in topical emphasis should guide your deeper study. For Nutanix, ensure you are comfortable with recursive tree traversals, graph DFS, and related applications like finding connected components or paths.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DFS (Tree Traversal) - Nutanix Focus
def dfs(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    return dfs(node.left, target) or dfs(node.right, target)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS (Tree Traversal) - Nutanix Focus
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS (Tree Traversal) - Nutanix Focus
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

For Airbnb, prioritize practicing classic DP patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings or arrays.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP (Fibonacci) - Airbnb Focus
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP (Fibonacci) - Airbnb Focus
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP (Fibonacci) - Airbnb Focus
public int fib(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
    if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int result = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    memo.put(n, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with Nutanix if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. The higher concentration of Easy questions allows you to solidify fundamentals—data structure operations, basic algorithms, and bug-free coding—in a less pressured context. The DFS focus is also a more concrete and common starting point for graph problems than Dynamic Programming.

Prepare for Airbnb after building a solid foundation and when you are ready to tackle more Medium-difficulty problems that often require combining concepts. The DP focus requires more dedicated practice to recognize patterns and states, which is generally a later-stage skill in interview prep. Success with Airbnb's question set implies you can handle a wider variety of moderately complex algorithmic challenges.

Ultimately, a strong core preparation covering Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings benefits you for both. Then, branch your deep-dive topics based on your target company: DFS/Graphs for Nutanix, and Dynamic Programming for Airbnb.
