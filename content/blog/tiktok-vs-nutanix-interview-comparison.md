When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are truly tested. TikTok and Nutanix, while both demanding strong algorithmic knowledge, present distinct landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus areas. Understanding these differences is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of preparation differs dramatically. TikTok's list of 383 questions is nearly six times larger than Nutanix's 68. This volume indicates a broader potential question pool and a higher likelihood of encountering a problem you've practiced.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story. TikTok's breakdown (Easy: 42, Medium: 260, Hard: 81) shows a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems, with Mediums constituting about 68% of the list. This aligns with the intense, fast-paced interview style common in top tech firms. You must be proficient at solving complex problems under time pressure.

Nutanix's list (Easy: 5, Medium: 46, Hard: 17) is smaller but proportionally even more challenging. A staggering 93% of their questions are rated Medium or Hard, with Mediums making up about 68% of the total as well. While the absolute number is lower, the concentration on difficult problems suggests a deep, rather than broad, evaluation of problem-solving skills. You need to master complex implementations, not just recognize patterns quickly.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** are top topics for both, forming a critical common core. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key divergence lies in the fourth-ranked topic. TikTok prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a topic known for its difficulty and pattern-based nature. The high volume of questions means you'll likely face multiple DP variations. Nutanix, conversely, lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, indicating a stronger focus on graph and tree traversal problems.

This difference shapes preparation:

- **For TikTok**: You must drill DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, LCS, LIS, etc.) extensively.
- **For Nutanix**: You need robust skills in recursive traversal, cycle detection, and backtracking on tree/graph structures.

```python
# Example: A common DP pattern (TikTok-relevant)
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example: A common DFS pattern (Nutanix-relevant)
function hasPathDFS(graph, start, end, visited = new Set()) {
  if (start === end) return true;
  visited.add(start);
  for (let neighbor of graph[start] || []) {
    if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
      if (hasPathDFS(graph, neighbor, end, visited)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common DFS pattern (Nutanix-relevant)
public boolean hasPathDFS(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start, int end, Set<Integer> visited) {
    if (start == end) return true;
    visited.add(start);
    for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(start, new ArrayList<>())) {
        if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
            if (hasPathDFS(graph, neighbor, end, visited)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Nutanix**. Its smaller, highly concentrated question set allows for deep, focused mastery. You can thoroughly learn the core topics (Array, Hash Table, String, DFS) and tackle most of the 68 questions. This builds a strong foundation in complex problem-solving without being overwhelming.

Then, move to **TikTok**. Use the established core skills and expand into the high-volume list. The additional practice on the shared topics will be beneficial, but the major new work will be internalizing the many Dynamic Programming patterns. Preparing for TikTok last effectively scales your knowledge from deep focus to broad pattern recognition, which is the more logical learning progression.

Ultimately, Nutanix preparation is a deep dive into algorithmic rigor, while TikTok preparation is a marathon of pattern recognition across a vast problem set. Mastering the core topics first makes the broader challenge manageable.
