When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Cisco and eBay, while both established technology giants, show distinct patterns in their coding interview question profiles. This comparison breaks down the volume, difficulty, and core topics for each, providing a clear roadmap for your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a significant difference in the total number of documented questions and their difficulty distribution.

**Cisco** presents a larger question pool with **86 total questions**. The breakdown is 22 Easy (E22), 49 Medium (M49), and 15 Hard (H15) problems. This larger volume, coupled with a higher proportion of Medium-difficulty questions (57%), suggests that Cisco's interviews are designed to thoroughly assess a candidate's problem-solving skills under typical constraints. The presence of 15 Hard questions indicates you may encounter complex optimization challenges, especially for more senior roles.

**eBay** has a smaller, but still substantial, pool of **60 total questions**. The distribution is 12 Easy (E12), 38 Medium (M38), and 10 Hard (H10). Similar to Cisco, Medium questions dominate (63% of the pool). The slightly lower total volume and marginally fewer Hard questions might suggest a slightly more focused interview loop, but the emphasis remains squarely on solid, medium-level algorithmic proficiency.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures and algorithms, with near-identical primary topics.

The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews. You must be exceptionally comfortable manipulating arrays and strings, and using hash maps (dictionaries) for efficient lookups and state tracking.

```python
# Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

The key difference lies in a secondary focus area:

- **Cisco** explicitly includes **Two Pointers** as a major topic. This technique is crucial for solving problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or finding pairs.
- **eBay** explicitly lists **Sorting** as a major topic. This implies a focus on problems where sorting the input is a critical pre-processing step or where custom comparators are needed.

In practice, these techniques often appear together. A Two Pointers solution frequently requires a sorted array, and Sorting is a common precursor to other algorithms.

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the high degree of overlap, a unified preparation strategy is effective. Start with the **common core: Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery here will serve you for both companies and most other interviews.

If you have an interview with one company scheduled first, prioritize its unique emphasis:

- Prepare for **Cisco** by practicing Two Pointers patterns on sorted data and linked lists.
- Prepare for **eBay** by diving deeper into Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) and their applications, including writing custom comparator functions.

However, if you are preparing broadly, tackle **Cisco's question list first**. Its larger pool and inclusion of Two Pointers covers a wider range of fundamental patterns. Successfully solving a broad set of Cisco's Medium-difficulty problems will inherently build the skills needed for eBay's listed topics, including sorting-related challenges. The reverse is less true, as practicing primarily sorting problems might leave you less drilled on the specific Two Pointers technique Cisco favors.

Ultimately, a strong foundation in the shared topics will get you most of the way. Then, allocate final review time to the specific patterns favored by your target company.
