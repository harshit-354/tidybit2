When preparing for technical interviews at Salesforce or Zoho, understanding the nature and focus of their coding questions is crucial for efficient study. Both companies assess fundamental software engineering skills, but their question banks reveal distinct priorities in volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation based on these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions is similar, but the distribution by difficulty level is markedly different.

Salesforce's set of **189 questions** is more heavily weighted toward medium and hard challenges. With **113 Medium (M)** and **49 Hard (H)** problems, they make up nearly 86% of the question pool. This suggests Salesforce interviews often probe deeper into algorithmic optimization and complex problem-solving under constraints. The relatively low count of **27 Easy (E)** questions implies that the initial screening or early rounds may move quickly past fundamentals.

In contrast, Zoho's **179 questions** show a stronger focus on foundational competency. With **62 Easy** and **97 Medium** problems, these two categories constitute about 89% of their questions. The **20 Hard** problems indicate that while advanced topics are tested, they are less frequent. This difficulty spread aligns with Zoho's product suite and may reflect an interview process that thoroughly assesses coding clarity, reliability, and mastery of basics before escalating complexity.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies consistently test four core data structures and algorithms: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This significant overlap means a strong foundation in these areas is essential for either interview.

- **Array and String** manipulations form the backbone of problems at both companies, involving tasks like searching, sorting, partitioning, and subsequence analysis.
- **Hash Table** usage is critical for optimizing lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, pair finding, and caching.
- **Dynamic Programming** appears in both sets, indicating expectations for solving optimization problems involving overlapping subproblems, such as longest common subsequence, knapsack variations, or pathfinding.

Given the shared emphasis, mastering these topics with the following patterns is highly effective:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Hash Table for a frequency-based problem (Two Sum variant)
def find_pairs(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            result.append((seen[complement], i))
        seen[num] = i
    return result
```

```javascript
// Example: Hash Table for a frequency-based problem (Two Sum variant)
function findPairs(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      result.push([seen.get(complement), i]);
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
// Example: Hash Table for a frequency-based problem (Two Sum variant)
import java.util.*;

public List<int[]> findPairs(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            result.add(new int[]{seen.get(complement), i});
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

</div>

The main difference lies in the depth of exploration. Salesforce's harder problems might combine these topics (e.g., Dynamic Programming on a String with Hash Table memoization) more frequently, while Zoho's problems may apply them in more straightforward, yet varied, scenarios.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by the company you are targeting and your timeline.

If you are interviewing at **Zoho**, start with the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and ensure you can solve Easy and Medium problems fluently. Build a solid, bug-free approach before tackling the smaller set of Hard problems. This path ensures you cover the vast majority of their question types.

If you are targeting **Salesforce**, you should still build a foundation with core topics, but allocate substantial time to Medium and Hard problem practice. Focus on optimization, edge cases, and complex DP or graph problems that may be adjacent to the core topics. Practice under time pressure to simulate their interview intensity.

For a generalist preparing for both, **begin with Zoho's focus**. Mastering the high volume of Easy and Medium problems across the shared topics creates a robust foundation. Once you can solve these efficiently, transition to the more challenging Medium and Hard problems prevalent in Salesforce's question bank. This approach builds competency progressively and reduces the risk of being overwhelmed by advanced problems prematurely.
