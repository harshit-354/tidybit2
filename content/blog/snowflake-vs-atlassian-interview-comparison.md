When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each can dramatically increase your efficiency. Snowflake and Atlassian, while both leaders in their domains, present distinct interview landscapes. Snowflake, a cloud data platform, tends to have a heavier emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving, whereas Atlassian, known for its collaboration software, often blends algorithmic questions with practical, system-oriented thinking. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear disparity in the sheer number of documented questions and their difficulty distribution.

**Snowflake** presents a larger and more challenging problem set, with **104 total questions** categorized as 12 Easy, 66 Medium, and 26 Hard. This high volume, coupled with a significant portion of Medium and Hard questions (88.5%), indicates that Snowflake's interviews are heavily weighted toward complex algorithmic problem-solving. Candidates should expect a rigorous coding round that tests deep understanding and optimization.

**Atlassian**, in contrast, has a smaller documented set of **62 total questions**, with a distribution of 7 Easy, 43 Medium, and 12 Hard. While still challenging, the proportion of Medium and Hard questions is slightly lower (88.7%), and the overall count is about 40% less than Snowflake's. This suggests Atlassian's technical screen might be slightly less exhaustive in pure algorithm count, potentially leaving more room for discussions on design or behavioral aspects.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with subtle differences in priority that reflect their engineering needs.

The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. These are universal building blocks for coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Using a Hash Table (dictionary) to solve a common frequency problem.
def find_duplicate(nums):
    seen = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen[num] = True
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: Using a Hash Table (object) to solve a common frequency problem.
function findDuplicate(nums) {
  const seen = {};
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (seen[num]) return num;
    seen[num] = true;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: Using a Hash Table (HashMap) to solve a common frequency problem.
public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    Map<Integer, Boolean> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (seen.containsKey(num)) return num;
        seen.put(num, true);
    }
    return -1;
}
```

The key differentiator is the fourth most frequent topic. For **Snowflake, Depth-First Search (DFS)** is prominent. This aligns with data platform engineering, where tree and graph traversals are common for querying hierarchical or graph-based data models. Expect problems involving trees, graphs, recursion, and backtracking.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DFS skeleton for a binary tree.
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Process node
    dfs(node.left)
    dfs(node.right)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS skeleton for a binary tree.
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Process node
  dfs(node.left);
  dfs(node.right);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS skeleton for a binary tree.
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Process node
    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
}
```

</div>

For **Atlassian, Sorting** is the fourth key topic. This points to an emphasis on data manipulation, optimization of lists, and preparing data for efficient processing—skills crucial for building performant features in collaboration and project management software.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and timeline.

If you are interviewing at **Snowflake**, you must prepare for it specifically and early. The larger question bank and higher prevalence of Hard problems, especially involving DFS and graphs, demand dedicated, advanced practice. A strong foundation in core data structures is not enough; you need to drill into complex graph algorithms and recursive solutions.

If **Atlassian** is your target, you can adopt a slightly more balanced approach. Start with a strong grasp of Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and Sorting algorithms. While challenging, the scope is slightly more contained. This foundation will also serve you well for many other companies, making it an efficient starting point.

For candidates targeting both, **begin with the common core**: master Array, String, and Hash Table problems to a Medium-Hard level. Then, branch out based on your interview schedule: if Snowflake is first, dive deep into DFS and graph theory; if Atlassian is first, solidify your knowledge of sorting algorithms and their applications.

Ultimately, success at either requires rigorous practice. Use the focused question banks on TidyBit to simulate their respective environments.
