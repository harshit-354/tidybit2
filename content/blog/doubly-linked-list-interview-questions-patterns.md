Doubly-linked lists are a fundamental data structure that frequently appear in coding interviews, especially at top tech companies. Unlike singly-linked lists, each node contains both `next` and `prev` pointers, enabling bidirectional traversal. This property makes them ideal for problems requiring efficient insertions/deletions at both ends, maintaining order (like LRU caches), or complex pointer manipulation. Mastering them demonstrates your understanding of low-level pointer mechanics and edge-case management.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Two-Pointer Traversal

Many problems involve finding a node, detecting cycles, or merging lists using two pointers. The bidirectional nature allows you to move forward and backward efficiently.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_middle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

```javascript
function findMiddle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return slow;
}
```

```java
public Node findMiddle(Node head) {
    Node slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    return slow;
}
```

</div>

### 2. Node Removal with `prev` Pointer

Removing a node in a doubly-linked list is O(1) if you have a reference to the node, as you can directly update the `prev` and `next` pointers of its neighbors.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_node(node):
    if node.prev:
        node.prev.next = node.next
    if node.next:
        node.next.prev = node.prev
    # Optional cleanup
    node.prev = node.next = None
```

```javascript
function removeNode(node) {
  if (node.prev) node.prev.next = node.next;
  if (node.next) node.next.prev = node.prev;
  // Optional cleanup
  node.prev = node.next = null;
}
```

```java
public void removeNode(Node node) {
    if (node.prev != null) node.prev.next = node.next;
    if (node.next != null) node.next.prev = node.prev;
    // Optional cleanup
    node.prev = node.next = null;
}
```

</div>

### 3. Maintaining Order with Head/Tail Pointers

For problems like designing an LRU cache or an ordered data structure, you often maintain explicit `head` and `tail` pointers. New nodes are added at the head (most recent), and the tail is removed when capacity is exceeded.

### 4. Flattening a Multilevel List

This pattern involves recursively traversing child lists and merging them back into the main list, carefully rewiring `prev` and `next` pointers at each level.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our dataset of 10 questions splits into 1 Easy (10%), 5 Medium (50%), and 4 Hard (40%). This distribution is telling:

- **Easy** questions typically test basic operations: insertion, deletion, or traversal.
- **Medium** problems (the majority) often combine doubly-linked lists with other concepts: designing a data structure (like a browser history), merging, or moderate pointer manipulation.
- **Hard** questions (a significant 40%) usually involve complex state management, like implementing an LRU/LFU cache, flattening a multilevel list, or solving a problem with multiple constraints requiring precise pointer updates.

The high percentage of Hard problems indicates that interviewers use doubly-linked lists to assess advanced system design and pointer control skills.

## Which Companies Ask Doubly-Linked List

Top companies frequently include doubly-linked list problems in their interviews:

- [Amazon](/company/amazon) often asks for LRU cache design.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) uses them for system design and low-level manipulation.
- [Google](/company/google) poses problems involving complex data structure composition.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) tests real-time data stream management.
- [Meta](/company/meta) focuses on practical applications like browser history or post feeds.

## Study Tips

1. **Draw Before You Code.** Always sketch the list with `prev` and `next` pointers. Visualizing pointer changes prevents errors when handling edge cases like the head or tail.
2. **Master the Basic Operations.** Be able to write bug-free functions for insertion (at head, tail, middle) and deletion without referencing the list's head, just the node itself.
3. **Practice Common Integrations.** Focus on problems where doubly-linked lists are part of a larger system, like a hash map in an LRU cache. Understand why the bidirectional links are necessary.
4. **Test Edge Cases.** Always check: empty list, single node, operations at the head, operations at the tail, and null pointer access.
