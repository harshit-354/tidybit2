Huawei’s coding interviews are a rigorous filter designed to assess strong fundamentals and problem-solving speed. The process typically involves multiple technical rounds focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design, with a heavy emphasis on writing clean, efficient code under pressure. Success requires targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 20 recent Huawei coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 4 Easy (20%), 11 Medium (55%), and 5 Hard (25%). This breakdown is telling. The majority of your interview will be fought in the "Medium" difficulty zone. These questions test your ability to apply core algorithms to slightly novel problems. The significant 25% Hard allocation means you must be prepared for complex scenarios, often involving optimization or combining multiple concepts. You cannot afford to be weak on fundamentals; the Easy questions are likely warm-ups or screening tools. Your goal is to master Medium problems and build enough competency in Hard patterns to have a fighting chance.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a clear set of high-priority areas. Allocate your study time accordingly.

- **Array & Two Pointers:** Frequently combined. Master techniques for sliding windows, partitioning, and searching in sorted arrays.
- **String:** Focus on manipulation, palindrome checks, and substring problems, often solved with the two pointers or sliding window patterns from above.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical area for Medium and Hard problems. You must be able to identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Start with classic problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and maximum subarray.
- **Stack:** Essential for parsing, next-greater-element problems, and implementing DFS iteratively. Understand monotonic stack patterns for efficiency.

Given that Array and Two Pointers are top topics, the **sliding window** pattern is arguably the most important technique to internalize. It's the optimal solution for a huge class of substring and subarray problems.

```python
def max_subarray_sum_fixed_size(arr, k):
    """Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(arr) < k:
        return -1

    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Slide the window: remove leftmost, add new rightmost
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum

# Example
print(max_subarray_sum_fixed_size([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3))  # Output: 9 (5+1+3)
```

```javascript
function maxSubarraySumFixedSize(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return -1;

  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Example
console.log(maxSubarraySumFixedSize([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class SlidingWindow {
    public static int maxSubarraySumFixedSize(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length < k) return -1;

        int windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        int maxSum = windowSum;

        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(maxSubarraySumFixedSize(arr, 3)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate each day to one of the top topics (Array, String, DP, Stack). For each, solve 10-15 curated problems, starting with Easy to build confidence and moving to Medium. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just the solution. Implement every solution in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery.** Start solving mixed-topic Medium problems. This is where you learn to combine patterns (e.g., using a hash map with a sliding window for variable-size problems). Time yourself. Aim to solve a new Medium problem in 25-30 minutes, including explaining your approach. Revisit and re-solve the hardest problems from the first two weeks.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Hard Problem Exposure.** Simulate the real environment. Do at least 5-7 timed mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Spend 2-3 days specifically dissecting Hard problems from Huawei's question pool. Don't aim to solve them instantly; aim to understand the thought process that leads from a brute-force idea to the optimized solution.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** From the moment you see the question, talk. Explain your initial thoughts, walk through a small example, discuss trade-offs of different approaches, and then code. Silence is your biggest enemy.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** It's often acceptable to start with a brute-force solution and then optimize. Say, "The naive approach is O(n²). I can improve this to O(n log n) with a sort, but I think we can get to O(n) using a hash map." This demonstrates systematic thinking.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Don't just write pseudocode. Use proper variable names, handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values), and include brief comments for complex logic. This shows attention to detail.
4.  **Test Your Own Code.** Before declaring "done," walk through your code with the given example and one edge case. Verbally state what the value of each variable is at key steps. This often catches off-by-one errors.
