When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can dramatically improve your odds. Walmart Labs and Snapchat, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes. Walmart Labs, the tech arm of the retail giant, focuses on building scalable e-commerce systems, leading to a heavy emphasis on core data processing. Snapchat, a social media pioneer, prioritizes real-time features and network-based interactions, which shapes its technical assessment. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in both the number of documented questions and their difficulty distribution.

**Walmart Labs** has a larger overall pool with **152 questions** (E22/M105/H25). The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty, which constitutes about 69% of the total. This suggests their interviews are consistently challenging but grounded in standard algorithmic concepts. The high volume of questions indicates a broad but predictable scope; you are likely to encounter well-known problem patterns.

**Snapchat** has a smaller, more concentrated pool of **99 questions** (E6/M62/H31). Notably, the proportion of **Hard** questions is higher (about 31% vs. Walmart's 16%), while Easy questions are minimal. This points to an interview process that is intensely focused on complex problem-solving. The smaller question bank might imply deeper, more nuanced exploration of fewer concepts during the interview itself.

In short, Walmart Labs tests breadth and consistency with a medium-difficulty core, while Snapchat tests depth and advanced problem-solving under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but their specialized focuses diverge.

**Common Ground (Array, String, Hash Table):** These are foundational for both. Expect problems involving string manipulation, array transformations, and efficient lookups.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

**Walmart Labs Specialization: Dynamic Programming.** The significant presence of DP aligns with optimizing complex, large-scale systems (e.g., inventory, pricing, logistics). Prepare for classic DP problems on strings, sequences, and knapsack-like scenarios.

**Snapchat Specialization: Breadth-First Search.** The focus on BFS reflects the graph-based nature of social networks (e.g., finding shortest paths between users, social breadth, feature propagation). You must be comfortable with queue-based traversal on matrices and graph adjacency lists.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: BFS on a Grid
from collections import deque

def bfs_grid(grid, start):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        # Process cell (r, c)
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
```

```javascript
// Example: BFS on a Grid
function bfsGrid(grid, start) {
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  const dirs = [
    [1, 0],
    [-1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
  ];
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set();
  visited.add(`${start[0]},${start[1]}`);

  while (queue.length) {
    const [r, c] = queue.shift();
    // Process cell (r, c)
    for (const [dr, dc] of dirs) {
      const nr = r + dr,
        nc = c + dc;
      const key = `${nr},${nc}`;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.has(key)) {
        visited.add(key);
        queue.push([nr, nc]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```java
// Example: BFS on a Grid
import java.util.*;

public void bfsGrid(int[][] grid, int[] start) {
    int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
    int[][] directions = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

    queue.offer(start);
    visited.add(start[0] + "," + start[1]);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int[] cell = queue.poll();
        int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];
        // Process cell (r, c)
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
            String key = nr + "," + nc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.contains(key)) {
                visited.add(key);
                queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Walmart Labs**. Its larger question bank with a strong Medium-difficulty core provides an excellent foundation in the universal topics (Array, String, Hash Table) that Snapchat also tests. Mastering these, along with Dynamic Programming, builds robust problem-solving muscles. This broad preparation makes you interview-ready for many companies.

Once comfortable, pivot to **Snapchat**. Use the foundational skills to tackle its higher concentration of Hard problems. Dedicate focused practice to Breadth-First Search, graph algorithms, and complex matrix traversals. The smaller question pool means you can drill deeply into each problem, focusing on optimization and edge cases.

Effectively, preparing for Walmart Labs builds your general competency, while preparing for Snapchat sharpens it to a high degree of specialization and difficulty.
