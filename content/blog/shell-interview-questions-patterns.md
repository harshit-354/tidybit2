Shell scripting questions test your ability to manipulate files, processes, and text streams—core skills for automation, DevOps, and system-related roles. While less common than algorithm problems, they appear in interviews for infrastructure, SRE, and backend positions, especially where operational efficiency is key. Mastering a few core patterns can turn these questions from obscure puzzles into straightforward exercises.

## Common Patterns

Success in shell interviews hinges on recognizing a handful of fundamental text-processing and system interaction patterns.

**1. Text Filtering and Transformation with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`**
This is the most frequent pattern. You'll often need to extract, replace, or reformat data from log files or command output.

- Use `grep` to filter lines matching a pattern.
- Use `sed` for straightforward search-and-replace or deletion.
- Use `awk` for more complex column-based processing and calculations.

**2. File and Directory Traversal**
Questions often involve finding files with certain properties (name, size, modification time) and performing actions on them. The `find` command is central here, often combined with `xargs` or `-exec` for batch operations.

**3. Process and System Resource Inspection**
You might need to list processes, filter them by name or resource usage, or send signals. Commands like `ps`, `top`, `kill`, and `pkill` are essential, often piped into filtering tools.

**4. Data Aggregation and Reporting**
This involves summarizing data, like counting occurrences, summing values, or finding unique entries. Tools like `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and `awk` are combined to build reports.

<div class="code-group">

```bash
# Pattern Example: Find all .log files modified in the last 7 days and count lines containing "ERROR"
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -7 -type f -exec grep -l "ERROR" {} \; | xargs wc -l
```

```bash
# Pattern Example: Parse a CSV (comma-delimited) and print the sum of the second column
awk -F',' '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}' data.csv
```

</div>

## Difficulty Breakdown

The provided data shows a split of **50% Easy** and **50% Medium** questions, with **0% Hard**. This is a critical insight for your preparation strategy.

- **Easy (50%):** These questions test basic competency. They typically involve a single, common command or a simple pipeline of two commands. Examples include: "How do you find all files containing a specific string?" or "Count the number of lines in a file." Your goal here is speed and accuracy—these are questions you must nail.
- **Medium (50%):** These questions combine patterns. You'll need to chain multiple commands with pipes, use more complex regular expressions, or handle edge cases (like spaces in filenames). An example might be: "From a web server log, find the top 5 IP addresses by request count." This tests your fluency in building multi-stage data pipelines in the shell.
- **Hard (0%):** The absence of hard questions is telling. It indicates that deep, esoteric shell scripting minutiae are rarely the focus. Interviewers are more interested in practical, composable skills rather than arcane syntax. You can deprioritize memorizing the most obscure flags and options.

This breakdown means you should focus on **breadth and combination**. Be solid on all easy concepts and practice stitching medium-difficulty pipelines together.

## Which Companies Ask Shell

Shell questions are most prevalent at large tech companies with significant infrastructure, where scripting is part of daily operations for many engineers.

- [Google](/company/google) and [Meta](/company/meta) often include shell questions for Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and infrastructure-focused software engineering roles.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) may ask them for backend and systems positions, particularly those related to data processing or automation.
- [Adobe](/company/adobe) could include them in interviews for roles involving build systems, developer tooling, or cloud operations.

If you're interviewing for a role mentioning Linux, DevOps, SRE, or backend systems, a shell scripting round or a few shell questions within a broader interview are a strong possibility.

## Study Tips

1.  **Learn by Doing, Not Just Reading.** Open a terminal. Don't passively read about `awk`; create a test file and practice extracting columns, computing sums, and formatting output. Muscle memory for command syntax is built through repetition.
2.  **Master the Core Toolset.** Depth in 6-8 tools is better than shallow knowledge of 20. Achieve fluency in: `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `find`, `sort`, `uniq`, `xargs`, and `cut`. Know their most common flags (`-i`, `-r`, `-n`, `-E` for grep; `-F`, `-v` for awk; `-name`, `-type`, `-exec` for find).
3.  **Practice Building Pipelines.** Start with the desired output and work backwards. If you need a sorted list of unique errors, think: `grep` to get errors -> `sort` them -> `uniq` to deduplicate. Practice breaking down medium problems into these sequential steps.
4.  **Handle Edge Cases in Your Solutions.** Mentioning edge cases shows thoroughness. What if a filename has a space? (Use `find -print0` and `xargs -0`). What if the input is empty? (Your `awk` script shouldn't crash). Thinking about these will set you apart.

The key to shell interviews is practical fluency. Understand the patterns, combine the tools, and articulate your process.
