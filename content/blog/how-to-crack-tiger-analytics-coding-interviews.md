Tiger Analytics interviews for data science and analytics roles include a coding round that tests fundamental problem-solving skills. While their problems are often applied in a data context, the core is standard algorithmic thinking. The process typically involves one or two coding interviews focusing on data structures, algorithms, and basic data manipulation, followed by domain-specific discussions.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, Tiger Analytics coding questions show a clear skew: 100% are categorized as Easy, with 0% at Medium or Hard difficulty. This breakdown is significant. It does not mean the interviews are trivial, but rather that they prioritize **correctness, clean code, and practical problem-solving** over complex algorithmic gymnastics. You are unlikely to face obscure graph algorithms or advanced dynamic programming puzzles. Instead, expect problems that test your ability to write bug-free, efficient code for common data tasks—like filtering datasets, computing aggregates, or transforming data structures. The emphasis is on demonstrating you can be a reliable coder who gets the fundamentals right.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights three critical areas: **Array**, **Dynamic Programming**, and **Hash Table**. Mastering these will cover the vast majority of their technical screen.

**Array:** This is the most fundamental data structure and the backbone of most data manipulation. Expect problems involving traversal, filtering, and in-place modifications. You must be comfortable with slicing, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.

**Dynamic Programming (DP):** While the difficulty is rated Easy, DP concepts appear in simplified forms, often related to optimization over sequences (like finding a maximum sum). Focus on the core idea of breaking problems into overlapping subproblems and memoization. The classic "climbing stairs" or "maximum subarray" problems are good benchmarks.

**Hash Table:** This is essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting, a common task in data analysis. Be prepared to use hash maps to count occurrences, check for duplicates, or map keys to values for fast access.

For Tiger Analytics, the most important pattern across these topics is likely **frequency counting with a hash table**, as it's a direct, practical skill for data work. Here is a canonical example: finding the single number in an array where every other element appears twice.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    for num, count in freq.items():
        if count == 1:
            return num
    return -1  # or handle as needed

# More efficient XOR solution for this specific problem:
# def singleNumber(nums):
#     result = 0
#     for num in nums:
#         result ^= num
#     return result
```

```javascript
function singleNumber(nums) {
  const freq = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (const [num, count] of freq) {
    if (count === 1) {
      return num;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

// XOR solution:
// function singleNumber(nums) {
//     return nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc ^ num, 0);
// }
```

```java
public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : freq.entrySet()) {
        if (entry.getValue() == 1) {
            return entry.getKey();
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

// XOR solution:
// public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
//     int result = 0;
//     for (int num : nums) {
//         result ^= num;
//     }
//     return result;
// }
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than cramming. Here is a 5-week schedule.

**Week 1-2: Foundation.** Solidify core data structures. Practice 10-15 Easy problems each on Arrays and Hash Tables. Focus on writing complete, runnable solutions. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter by company and difficulty.

**Week 3: Core Algorithms.** Introduce basic Dynamic Programming. Solve foundational problems like Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, and Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock. Understand the memoization and tabulation approaches.

**Week 4: Integration and Patterns.** Solve mixed problem sets that combine topics, like using a hash table to optimize an array problem. Practice 2-3 problems daily, ensuring you can explain your approach.

**Week 5: Mock Interviews and Review.** Simulate the interview environment. Time yourself solving Easy problems without an IDE. Review all code you've written for potential edge cases and bugs. Revisit the most common patterns.

**Final Days:** Light review. Get good sleep. The goal is to be so comfortable with the fundamentals that you can solve straightforward problems under pressure without hesitation.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** Given the Easy difficulty, a complete, correct, and readable solution is better than an optimal but incomplete one. Handle edge cases explicitly.
2.  **Communicate Your Process.** Think out loud. Start by restating the problem, then walk through examples, discuss your approach (e.g., "I'll use a hash map to count frequencies"), and finally code.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with proper indentation. This shows you think about maintainability.
4.  **Test with Examples.** Before declaring done, walk through your code with the sample input and a couple of edge cases (empty array, single element, large values). Verbally confirm the output.
5.  **Connect to Data Context.** When explaining, briefly mention how the algorithm might apply to a real data task (e.g., "This frequency counter could help find unique users in a log file").

Success in Tiger Analytics coding interviews comes from demonstrating reliable, fundamental skills. Master the core topics, practice clean coding habits, and communicate clearly.
