Tree questions appear in over 30% of technical interviews for software engineering roles. They test a candidate's grasp of hierarchical data, recursive thinking, and efficient traversal—skills directly applicable to file systems, database indexing, and UI component rendering. With 180 questions in our database, mastering trees is non-negotiable.

## Common Patterns

Most tree problems are variations of a few core patterns. Recognizing them turns a hard problem into a familiar one.

**1. Depth-First Search (DFS)**
This is the fundamental recursive traversal. You process a node and then recursively visit its children. It's used for pathfinding, searching, and many property calculations.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order: Process node first
    print(node.val)
    dfs(node.left)
    dfs(node.right)
```

```javascript
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order: Process node first
  console.log(node.val);
  dfs(node.left);
  dfs(node.right);
}
```

```java
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Pre-order: Process node first
    System.out.println(node.val);
    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
}
```

</div>

**2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level-Order Traversal**
Use a queue to visit all nodes at the present depth before moving deeper. Essential for problems involving levels, like finding the minimum depth or right-side view.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node.val)
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
    return result
```

```javascript
function bfs(root) {
  if (!root) return [];
  const queue = [root];
  const result = [];
  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    result.push(node.val);
    if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
    if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public List<Integer> bfs(TreeNode root) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null) return result;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode node = queue.poll();
        result.add(node.val);
        if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
        if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
    }
    return result;
}
```

</div>

**3. The "Tree Property" Pattern**
Many problems ask you to validate or compute a property across the tree (e.g., "Is it a valid BST?"). The solution often involves passing down constraints (like min/max allowed values) during a DFS.

**4. Path Sum and Target Problems**
These require tracking a sum or path from root to leaf. The standard approach is a DFS that carries a running sum, often backtracking after exploring a branch.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 101 Medium questions (56%), 41 Hard (23%), and 38 Easy (21%). This split is telling.

Easy questions typically test basic traversal and property checks. They are warm-ups. The high concentration of Medium problems is the core of the interview. These questions combine 2-3 patterns, like performing a BFS while tracking node depth or using DFS with memoization. Hard questions usually involve complex manipulation (like serialization), advanced data structures (like segment trees), or optimizing a brute-force DFS solution with dynamic programming on trees.

## Which Companies Ask Tree Questions

All top tech companies frequently include tree problems. They are a reliable filter for algorithmic skill.

- [Google](/company/google) often asks about tree serialization, property validation, and traversal variations.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Meta](/company/meta) commonly test path sum problems, level-order traversal, and lowest common ancestor.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) favor questions on BST operations, iterative traversals, and constructing trees from data.

## Study Tips

1.  **Master Recursion First.** If recursion feels shaky, tree problems will be overwhelming. Practice simple recursive problems until the call stack is intuitive.
2.  **Draw Before You Code.** For any non-trivial problem, sketch the tree and manually walk through your algorithm. This catches logical errors in pointer handling or state management.
3.  **Memorize the Traversals.** Have the iterative and recursive code for pre-, in-, post-order, and BFS written from memory. This is your toolbox.
4.  **Target Mediums.** Allocate most of your study time to Medium-difficulty problems. They build the pattern recognition needed to tackle Hards and are the most likely interview fare.
