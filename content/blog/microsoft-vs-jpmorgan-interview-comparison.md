When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: a pure technology giant and a global financial institution with a massive engineering footprint. While both assess core algorithmic problem-solving, their approach, volume, and focus differ significantly.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Microsoft's question bank is vast, with 1,352 documented questions, heavily weighted toward Medium (762) and Easy (379) difficulty, with a smaller set of Hard (211) problems. This reflects a broad, established hiring process where candidates may encounter a wide range of classic problems. Preparation requires covering significant ground.

In contrast, JPMorgan's set is far more concentrated, with only 78 questions. The distribution is 45 Medium, 25 Easy, and 8 Hard. This suggests a more focused interview process, likely prioritizing practical, clean solutions over obscure algorithmic depth. The lower volume does not necessarily mean easier interviews; it means the known question space is narrower, and each problem may be more representative of what you'll see.

```python
# Example of a common 'Medium' array problem you might see at either company.
def max_subarray(nums):
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
    return global_max
```

```javascript
function maxSubarray(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0];
  let globalMax = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
    globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
  }
  return globalMax;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int currentMax = nums[0];
    int globalMax = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
        globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
    }
    return globalMax;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** are top topics for both, indicating that mastery of these is non-negotiable.

- **Microsoft** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a core topic, which aligns with its focus on algorithmic optimization and computer science fundamentals. Expect problems involving recursion, memoization, and state transition.
- **JPMorgan** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic instead of DP. This points toward interviews that stress data manipulation, efficiency in common business logic tasks, and implementing or utilizing sorting paradigms. While DP questions can appear, they are less of a stated focus.

This divergence is telling: Microsoft interviews often probe deeper into algorithmic theory, while JPMorgan's may prioritize getting a correct, efficient, and maintainable solution to a common data-processing challenge.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be dictated by your target company and timeline.

**Prepare for JPMorgan first if:** You are interviewing specifically for a financial institution or have limited time. The concentrated question set allows for deep, repetitive practice on a smaller corpus. Mastering arrays, strings, hash tables, and sorting algorithms will cover the explicit core topics. You can achieve reasonable coverage more quickly.

**Prepare for Microsoft first if:** You are aiming for top tech companies or have a longer runway. The vast question bank forces a broader and deeper understanding of algorithms, especially Dynamic Programming. Successfully preparing for Microsoft's scope will inherently cover nearly all of JPMorgan's technical focus, as you will have mastered the foundational topics and the more advanced DP patterns. The reverse is not true; preparing only for JPMorgan's set would leave large gaps for a Microsoft interview.

In essence, treat JPMorgan preparation as a focused subset of Microsoft preparation. Starting with the broader Microsoft curriculum builds a stronger overall foundation, which can then be refined for a more specific target like JPMorgan.
