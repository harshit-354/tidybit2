When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice. Zoho and eBay represent two distinct interview profiles—one with broad coverage and high volume, the other more focused and moderate. Understanding their differences helps you allocate study time efficiently.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Zoho’s repository is significantly larger and more challenging. With 179 total questions, its distribution (Easy: 62, Medium: 97, Hard: 20) indicates a strong emphasis on medium-difficulty problems. This volume suggests Zoho’s interviews may involve multiple rounds of problem-solving, testing both speed and depth of knowledge. The substantial number of Hard questions (20) means you must be comfortable with complex algorithm design and optimization.

eBay’s question bank is more compact at 60 questions, with a distribution of Easy: 12, Medium: 38, Hard: 10. While still challenging, the focus is narrower. The proportion of Medium questions is high, similar to Zoho, but the total count is about one-third. This implies eBay’s process might involve fewer coding rounds or more targeted questions, but the presence of Hard problems confirms they still assess advanced problem-solving.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** fundamentals. This is the core overlap and should be your foundational practice.

**Zoho’s** listed topics are Array, String, Hash Table, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The explicit inclusion of DP is critical. It signals that Zoho frequently asks problems involving optimization, recursion with memoization, or complex state transitions. You must prepare for classic DP patterns.

```python
# Example DP problem: Climbing Stairs (a classic)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP problem: Climbing Stairs
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP problem: Climbing Stairs
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

**eBay’s** listed topics are Array, String, Hash Table, and **Sorting**. While sorting is often a sub-step, its explicit mention suggests eBay may ask problems requiring custom comparators, efficient sort-based algorithms (like merging intervals), or analysis of sorting complexity. DP is not listed as a primary topic, but may appear within Medium or Hard problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Sorting problem: Custom sort (e.g., by frequency)
from collections import Counter
def sortByFrequency(nums):
    count = Counter(nums)
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (count[x], x))
```

```javascript
// Example Sorting problem: Custom sort (e.g., by frequency)
function sortByFrequency(nums) {
  const count = {};
  nums.forEach((n) => (count[n] = (count[n] || 0) + 1));
  return nums.sort((a, b) => count[a] - count[b] || a - b);
}
```

```java
// Example Sorting problem: Custom sort (e.g., by frequency)
import java.util.*;
public List<Integer> sortByFrequency(List<Integer> nums) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (int n : nums) count.put(n, count.getOrDefault(n, 0) + 1);
    nums.sort((a, b) -> {
        int freqCompare = count.get(a) - count.get(b);
        return freqCompare != 0 ? freqCompare : a - b;
    });
    return nums;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Zoho first** if you are interviewing at both or have time. Mastering Zoho’s larger question bank, especially its Dynamic Programming problems, will inherently cover eBay’s core topics of Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting. The reverse is not true; practicing only eBay’s questions leaves a significant gap in DP preparation for Zoho.

If you are short on time and only have an eBay interview, focus on their list. Drill into Sorting algorithms and their applications, while ensuring mastery of the three core data structures. You can likely defer intensive DP study.

Regardless of target, always solve problems from the company’s own repository. Practice Zoho questions here: [TidyBit Zoho](/company/zoho). Practice eBay questions here: [TidyBit eBay](/company/ebay).
