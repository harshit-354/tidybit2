Yahoo's technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving and coding skills. Candidates can expect a mix of algorithmic questions, system design discussions, and behavioral interviews focused on collaboration and impact.

## By the Numbers

The data from reported interviews shows a clear emphasis on foundational problem-solving. Of the 64 known LeetCode-style questions, the difficulty breakdown is 41% Easy, 50% Medium, and 9% Hard. This distribution is crucial for your strategy. It means the interview is heavily weighted toward testing your core competency and fluency with standard techniques, not on solving obscure, complex puzzles. The high percentage of Medium questions indicates you must be proficient at taking a known concept and applying it to a moderately tricky variation. The small number of Hard questions suggests that while you should be prepared for a challenge, the primary goal is to demonstrate clean, efficient, and correct code on problems that have clear algorithmic pathways.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form the essential toolkit for Yahoo interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** This is the most fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place modifications, and subarray problems. Your ability to manipulate indices and manage element relationships is key.
  - **Practical Depth:** Common patterns include sliding window for subarray/substring problems, prefix sums for range queries, and in-place operations using multiple pointers. A classic problem is moving all zeros to the end of an array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def move_zeros(nums):
    """
    Moves all zeros to the end in-place.
    Uses a two-pointer approach where `write` marks the position for the next non-zero element.
    """
    write = 0
    for read in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != 0:
            nums[write], nums[read] = nums[read], nums[write]
            write += 1
    return nums

# Example
print(move_zeros([0, 1, 0, 3, 12]))  # Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

```javascript
function moveZeros(nums) {
  let write = 0;
  for (let read = 0; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== 0) {
      // Swap non-zero element to the front section
      [nums[write], nums[read]] = [nums[read], nums[write]];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return nums;
}

// Example
console.log(moveZeros([0, 1, 0, 3, 12])); // Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

```java
public class ArrayOperations {
    public static void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int write = 0;
        for (int read = 0; read < nums.length; read++) {
            if (nums[read] != 0) {
                // Swap elements
                int temp = nums[write];
                nums[write] = nums[read];
                nums[read] = temp;
                write++;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 0, 3, 12};
        moveZeroes(arr);
        System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.toString(arr)); // Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
    }
}
```

- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups and solving problems related to frequency, duplicates, or pair matching. If a brute-force solution involves nested loops, a hash map is often the first optimization.
  - **Practical Depth:** Beyond simple lookups, hash tables (or dictionaries/maps) are essential for memoization, counting frequencies, and storing mappings. A quintessential problem is finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Returns indices of the two numbers that add up to target.
    Uses a hash map to store number -> index for O(1) lookups.
    """
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashTableExample {
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{numMap.get(complement), i};
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
        int[] result = twoSum(nums, 9);
        System.out.println("[" + result[0] + ", " + result[1] + "]"); // Output: [0, 1]
    }
}
```

- **String:** Closely related to array problems but with its own nuances like character encoding, palindromes, and substring searches. Practice common operations and pattern matching.
  - **Practical Depth:** Key techniques include two-pointer checks for palindromes, sliding windows for substrings, and character frequency counting. A common interview question is checking if a string is a valid palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Checks if a string is a valid palindrome.
    Uses two pointers, skipping non-alphanumeric characters.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric characters
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        # Compare characters case-insensitively
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

# Example
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))  # Output: True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Skip non-alphanumeric characters
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) {
      left++;
    }
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) {
      right--;
    }
    // Compare characters case-insensitively
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example
console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // Output: true
```

```java
public class StringOperations {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            // Skip non-alphanumeric characters
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
                left++;
            }
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
                right--;
            }
            // Compare characters case-insensitively
            if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // Output: true
    }
}
```

- **Sorting:** Rarely asked in isolation, sorting is a critical preprocessing step for many efficient solutions. Understand the trade-offs of different sorting algorithms and how they enable techniques like the two-pointer approach.
  - **Practical Depth:** You should know the time/space complexity of common sorts (QuickSort: O(n log n) avg, O(n²) worst; MergeSort: O(n log n) stable). In interviews, you'll often use built-in sorts. The power lies in using sorting to simplify problems, like finding if there are any duplicate elements in an array.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def contains_duplicate(nums):
    """
    Returns True if array contains duplicate values.
    Sorting first brings duplicates next to each other.
    """
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            return True
    return False

# Example
print(contains_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: True
print(contains_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: False
```

```javascript
function containsDuplicate(nums) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

// Example
console.log(containsDuplicate([1, 2, 3, 1])); // Output: true
console.log(containsDuplicate([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: false
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SortingExample {
    public static boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(containsDuplicate(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 1})); // Output: true
        System.out.println(containsDuplicate(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4})); // Output: false
    }
}
```

- **Two Pointers:** This is a fundamental technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings, such as finding pairs, removing duplicates, or checking for palindromes. It's a clean way to achieve O(n) time complexity for many problems that seem more complex.
  - **Practical Depth:** There are two main patterns: 1) Opposite-direction pointers (like in palindrome check), and 2) Same-direction fast/slow runners (like in removing duplicates from a sorted array). Mastering this technique is crucial for optimal array/string solutions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates_sorted(nums):
    """
    Removes duplicates in-place from a sorted array.
    Returns the new length. Uses a slow runner (write) and fast runner (read).
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write

# Example
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
new_length = remove_duplicates_sorted(arr)
print(f"New length: {new_length}, Array up to new length: {arr[:new_length]}")
# Output: New length: 5, Array up to new length: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicatesSorted(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}

// Example
let arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
let newLength = removeDuplicatesSorted(arr);
console.log(`New length: ${newLength}, Array up to new length: ${arr.slice(0, newLength)}`);
// Output: New length: 5, Array up to new length: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```java
public class TwoPointersExample {
    public static int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int write = 1;
        for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
            if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
                nums[write] = nums[read];
                write++;
            }
        }
        return write;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5};
        int newLength = removeDuplicates(arr);
        System.out.print("New length: " + newLength + ", Array up to new length: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < newLength; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        // Output: New length: 5, Array up to new length: 1 2 3 4 5
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy

A focused 4-6 week plan is effective. Prioritize depth over breadth.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting, Two Pointers), solve 10-15 curated problems. Start with Easy problems to cement syntax and basic patterns, then immediately move to Medium problems. Do not just solve; for each problem, articulate the time/space complexity and consider edge cases.

- **Practical Depth:** Create a tracking spreadsheet. For each problem, note the core technique used, time complexity, space complexity, and any tricky edge cases (empty input, single element, large values, negative numbers). This builds a mental library. For example, when practicing arrays, solve problems like "Maximum Subarray" (Kadane's Algorithm), "Product of Array Except Self" (prefix/suffix products), and "Container With Most Water" (two pointers).

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Medium Mastery.** The goal here is fluency. Start mixing topics and focus exclusively on Medium difficulty problems. This simulates the actual interview where the category isn't given. Practice problems that combine these topics, like using a hash table to complement an array traversal or applying two pointers on a sorted array. Begin timing your sessions (45-60 minutes per problem).

- **Practical Depth:** Work on problems that require multiple techniques. For instance, "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" combines hash tables (for character index tracking) and a sliding window (two pointers). Another example is "3Sum," which combines sorting, then using a fixed element with a two-pointer sweep to find complements. Write out the brute-force solution first, then optimize step-by-step, explaining each improvement's impact on complexity.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** In the final stretch, conduct at least 4-6 full mock interviews using Yahoo's question list. Practice speaking your thought process aloud from the moment you see the question. Identify any remaining weak spots in the core topics and revisit them. Allocate a small portion of time to reviewing less frequent topics like Linked Lists or Trees, but keep the core topics as your priority.

- **Practical Depth:** Simulate the real environment: use a plain text editor, set a timer, and talk through your thinking. After each mock, do a thorough retrospective. What went well? Where did you hesitate? Did you miss any edge cases? For gaps, if you struggle with a specific pattern like "sliding window with hash map," do a deep dive on 3-4 similar problems back-to-back to solidify the pattern.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Yahoo values collaborative engineers. Start by clarifying requirements and edge cases. Talk through your brute-force idea first, then optimize. Your interviewer is assessing your thought process as much as your final code.
    - **Example Dialogue:** "I see we need to find if two numbers sum to a target. A brute-force approach would check every pair, which is O(n²). We can optimize by using a hash map to store numbers we've seen, allowing us to check for the complement in O(1) time, bringing the overall time to O(n) with O(n) space. Edge cases to consider: empty array, no solution, duplicate numbers, and negative values."

2.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Given the prevalence of Easy and Medium questions, a clean, correct solution is better than a clever but buggy one. Use clear variable names, write helper functions if logic gets complex, and comment briefly on the key steps of your algorithm.
    - **Example:** Instead of `i` and `j`, use `left` and `right` for pointers. Instead of a complex one-liner, break it down: `# Step 1: Sort the array to enable two-pointer technique`.

3.  **Practice with Constraints.** In an interview, you write code in a plain text editor without an IDE. Practice writing syntactically correct code for your chosen language under this condition. Missing a semicolon or a bracket due to auto-complete reliance is an easily avoided mistake.
    - **Drill:** Regularly solve problems on a platform like TidyBit using their "plain text" mode or in a simple notepad application. Get used to manually typing out `import` statements, loop structures, and method signatures without auto-complete.

4.  **Don't Ignore the Follow-up.** Many Medium questions have a natural follow-up to improve time or space complexity. After arriving at a working solution, proactively ask, "Can we explore optimizing this further?" This shows the depth of thinking they're looking for.
    - **Common Follow-ups:** "Can we do it in O(1) extra space?" (often using input array for output). "What if the input is too large to fit in memory?" (streaming approach). "Can we handle this in a single pass?" (often using a more sophisticated data structure like a monotonic stack or heap).

Success in Yahoo's coding interviews hinges on a strong, communicative command of core data structures and algorithms. A focused preparation plan that prioritizes high-frequency topics and clear problem-solving will position you well.
