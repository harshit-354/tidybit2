FPT’s technical interviews for software roles are designed to assess practical problem-solving and coding fundamentals. While the company operates globally with diverse projects, its coding assessments consistently focus on core algorithmic thinking and clean implementation under time constraints. Understanding the specific patterns they favor can streamline your preparation significantly.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Recent data shows a clear pattern: FPT interviews are heavily weighted towards foundational problems. Out of a typical set of three questions, you can expect two Easy problems (67%) and one Medium problem (33%). Hard problems are statistically absent (0%). This breakdown is critical—it means success hinges on **speed, accuracy, and flawless execution on standard problems**, not on solving obscure, complex algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate you can write robust, bug-free code for common scenarios. Missing an edge case on an Easy problem is far more costly than not fully optimizing a Hard one. Your study should prioritize breadth and mastery of fundamentals over depth in advanced topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Math, Simulation, Array, and Hash Table. Often, problems combine these areas, like using a Hash Table to optimize an Array search or implementing a Mathematical formula within a Simulation.

- **Math:** Problems often involve number properties, basic arithmetic sequences, or modular arithmetic. You must identify the underlying formula to avoid inefficient computation.
- **Simulation:** This requires meticulously modeling a process step-by-step. The challenge is managing state and transitions without introducing off-by-one errors.
- **Array:** This is the most fundamental data structure. Expect tasks involving traversal, in-place modification, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Hash Table (Dictionary/Map):** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, frequently used to complement Array problems by tracking seen elements or counts.

A quintessential FPT pattern is using a **Hash Table to find a complement in an Array**, such as the classic Two Sum problem. This combines Array and Hash Table topics efficiently.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
// Example: new Solution().twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9) returns [0, 1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the topic distribution, a focused plan is effective.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Deeply practice problems tagged **Easy** and **Medium** for **Array** and **Hash Table**. Solve at least 15-20 problems from each category.
- Master the standard patterns: two-pointers, sliding window (for arrays), and using maps for frequency counting and lookups.
- Implement all solutions in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Secondary Topics & Integration**

- Shift focus to **Math** and **Simulation** problems. For Math, practice deriving formulas. For Simulation, practice writing clear, iterative logic.
- Start solving problems that combine topics, like "Simulate this game process (Simulation) and track scores in a map (Hash Table)."
- Begin timed practice sessions, aiming to solve an Easy problem within 10-15 minutes and a Medium within 20-25.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Conduct at least 6-8 mock interviews replicating the FPT format: 2 Easy, 1 Medium in a 60-75 minute block.
- Prioritize explaining your thought process clearly before coding.
- Rigorously test your own code with edge cases (empty input, single element, large values).

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** With no Hard problems, a complete, correct solution is the primary goal. Write straightforward, readable code first. Optimize only if needed and if time permits.
2.  **Communicate Your Process Verbally:** Before writing code, state the brute-force approach, then explain your optimization (e.g., "We can improve lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by using a hash map here"). This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Proactively:** After coding, immediately walk through examples, including minimal, maximal, and invalid inputs. This shows thoroughness and often catches bugs before the interviewer does.
4.  **Know Your Language's Standard Libraries:** Be fluent in the utilities for your chosen language (e.g., Python's `collections.Counter`, Java's `HashMap` methods, JavaScript's `Map` and `Set`) to implement solutions quickly and idiomatically.

Success in FPT interviews is a function of disciplined practice on their favored problem types. Solidify your fundamentals, practice under time pressure, and articulate your reasoning.
