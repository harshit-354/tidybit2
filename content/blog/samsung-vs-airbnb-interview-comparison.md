When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific patterns matter. Samsung and Airbnb both test core algorithmic skills but emphasize different problem types and contexts. Understanding their distinct profiles helps you allocate preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Samsung's tagged question pool on TidyBit is slightly larger at 69 questions, compared to Airbnb's 64. The difficulty distribution reveals different priorities.

Samsung (69 total):

- Easy: 15 (21.7%)
- Medium: 37 (53.6%)
- Hard: 17 (24.6%)

Airbnb (64 total):

- Easy: 11 (17.2%)
- Medium: 34 (53.1%)
- Hard: 19 (29.7%)

While both have a majority of Medium problems, Samsung has a higher proportion of Easy questions, suggesting a broader scope that includes more fundamental checks. Airbnb has a notably higher percentage of Hard problems, indicating a greater emphasis on complex, multi-step scenarios often tied to real-world product features like booking systems or string processing.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, but their application differs.

**Common Ground (Array, Hash Table, DP):** You will need strong fundamentals here. Array manipulation and hash tables for lookups are universal.

**Samsung's Focus:** The prominence of **Two Pointers** aligns with problems involving sequences, intervals, or in-place array operations common in systems and low-level optimization contexts. DP problems often relate to combinatorial counts, paths, or resource allocation.

**Airbnb's Focus:** The high frequency of **String** problems is a key differentiator. Airbnb's business involves heavy text processing—search, parsing, formatting user data, and validating inputs (like dates or listings). Their DP and array questions frequently model real-world constraints like calendar conflicts, pricing, or reservation systems.

Consider this classic Two Pointer problem, more common at Samsung:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def trap_rain_water(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max = right_max = water = 0
    while left <= right:
        if left_max <= right_max:
            left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
            water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
            water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1
    return water
```

```javascript
function trapRainWater(height) {
  let left = 0,
    right = height.length - 1;
  let leftMax = 0,
    rightMax = 0,
    water = 0;
  while (left <= right) {
    if (leftMax <= rightMax) {
      leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, height[left]);
      water += leftMax - height[left];
      left++;
    } else {
      rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, height[right]);
      water += rightMax - height[right];
      right--;
    }
  }
  return water;
}
```

```java
public int trapRainWater(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, water = 0;
    while (left <= right) {
        if (leftMax <= rightMax) {
            leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, height[left]);
            water += leftMax - height[left];
            left++;
        } else {
            rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, height[right]);
            water += rightMax - height[right];
            right--;
        }
    }
    return water;
}
```

</div>

Now, a String parsing problem more typical of Airbnb:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def parse_ternary(expression):
    stack = []
    i = len(expression) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        char = expression[i]
        if stack and stack[-1] == '?':
            stack.pop()  # remove '?'
            on_true = stack.pop()
            stack.pop()  # remove ':'
            on_false = stack.pop()
            stack.append(on_true if char == 'T' else on_false)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
        i -= 1
    return stack[0]
```

```javascript
function parseTernary(expression) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let i = expression.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const char = expression[i];
    if (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] === "?") {
      stack.pop(); // remove '?'
      const onTrue = stack.pop();
      stack.pop(); // remove ':'
      const onFalse = stack.pop();
      stack.push(char === "T" ? onTrue : onFalse);
    } else {
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack[0];
}
```

```java
public String parseTernary(String expression) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    for (int i = expression.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        char c = expression.charAt(i);
        if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '?') {
            stack.pop(); // remove '?'
            char onTrue = stack.pop();
            stack.pop(); // remove ':'
            char onFalse = stack.pop();
            stack.push(c == 'T' ? onTrue : onFalse);
        } else {
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return String.valueOf(stack.peek());
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Samsung first** if you are solidifying core algorithmic fundamentals. Its broader range, including more Easy problems and strong focus on Two Pointers and classic DP, builds a robust foundation. Mastering these patterns will make Airbnb's harder problems more approachable.

Prepare for **Airbnb first** if you are already comfortable with arrays, hash tables, and basic DP, and need to specialize. The intense focus on String manipulation and complex, scenario-based Hard problems requires dedicated practice. Success here often depends on careful edge-case handling and modeling.

Ultimately, a strong candidate for either company must be proficient in Array, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming. Use Samsung's list to build breadth and speed, then use Airbnb's list to develop depth and mastery in parsing and system design-like problem-solving.
