Eulerian Circuit problems are rare in coding interviews, but when they appear, they’re almost exclusively at the highest difficulty level. This makes them a critical differentiator for senior engineering roles at top tech companies. Understanding the core theory—identifying when a graph has a path that uses every edge exactly once and returns to the start—is essential. You won’t see many variations, but the few that exist test your ability to recognize a classic algorithm and adapt it to a novel problem constraint.

## Common Patterns

The core algorithm is Hierholzer’s algorithm for finding an Eulerian circuit in a directed or undirected graph. The interview challenge lies in framing the problem as a graph where “edges” must be traversed exhaustively.

**1. Hierholzer’s Algorithm for Directed Graphs**
The standard approach: verify all vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree (for a circuit), then perform a DFS that backtracks when a node has no unused edges, building the circuit in reverse.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_eulerian_circuit(edges, n):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    adj = defaultdict(deque)
    in_deg, out_deg = [0] * n, [0] * n

    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        out_deg[u] += 1
        in_deg[v] += 1

    # Check if Eulerian circuit exists
    if any(in_deg[i] != out_deg[i] for i in range(n)):
        return []

    circuit = []
    stack = [0]

    while stack:
        while adj[stack[-1]]:
            stack.append(adj[stack[-1]].popleft())
        circuit.append(stack.pop())

    return circuit[::-1] if len(circuit) == len(edges) + 1 else []
```

```javascript
function findEulerianCircuit(edges, n) {
  const adj = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  const inDeg = new Array(n).fill(0);
  const outDeg = new Array(n).fill(0);

  for (const [u, v] of edges) {
    adj[u].push(v);
    outDeg[u]++;
    inDeg[v]++;
  }

  if (inDeg.some((deg, i) => deg !== outDeg[i])) {
    return [];
  }

  const circuit = [];
  const stack = [0];

  while (stack.length) {
    while (adj[stack[stack.length - 1]].length) {
      stack.push(adj[stack[stack.length - 1]].shift());
    }
    circuit.push(stack.pop());
  }

  return circuit.length === edges.length + 1 ? circuit.reverse() : [];
}
```

```java
public List<Integer> findEulerianCircuit(int[][] edges, int n) {
    List<Integer>[] adj = new List[n];
    int[] inDeg = new int[n];
    int[] outDeg = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
        adj[u].add(v);
        outDeg[u]++;
        inDeg[v]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (inDeg[i] != outDeg[i]) return new ArrayList<>();
    }

    List<Integer> circuit = new ArrayList<>();
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    stack.push(0);

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        while (!adj[stack.peek()].isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(adj[stack.peek()].remove(0));
        }
        circuit.add(stack.pop());
    }

    Collections.reverse(circuit);
    return circuit.size() == edges.length + 1 ? circuit : new ArrayList<>();
}
```

</div>

**2. Constructing the Graph from a Sequence Problem**
Often the “edges” are implicit. In the classic “Reconstruct Itinerary” problem (LeetCode 332), tickets are directed edges and you must find a lexical Eulerian path. This requires sorting adjacency lists and handling the path (not circuit) case where exactly one node has out_deg = in_deg + 1 as the start.

**3. Verifying Eulerian Properties**
Before running the algorithm, you must check the necessary conditions:

- **Undirected circuit**: All vertices have even degree.
- **Directed circuit**: All vertices have in_degree == out_degree.
- **Path existence**: For Eulerian path, exactly 0 or 2 vertices (undirected) have odd degree; or exactly one vertex has out_deg = in_deg + 1 (start) and one has in_deg = out_deg + 1 (end) in directed graphs.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a stark distribution: 100% of Eulerian Circuit questions are categorized as Hard. This means you will never encounter these problems in early-career screenings. They appear exclusively in onsite interviews for senior positions (L5/E5 at Google/Facebook, Senior SDE at Amazon) or in specialized domains like infrastructure or mapping. The difficulty lies not in implementing Hierholzer’s algorithm itself, but in recognizing that a problem about “using all connections” or “finding a specific sequence” reduces to an Eulerian path/circuit problem. You’re tested on graph modeling and application of advanced algorithms.

## Which Companies Ask Eulerian Circuit

These questions are favored by companies with complex routing, networking, or data infrastructure problems:

- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – in logistics and AWS networking roles.
- [Google](/company/google) – for mapping, flight routing, or data pipeline problems.
- [Meta](/company/meta) – in infrastructure or data engineering interviews.
- [Snapchat](/company/snapchat) – occasionally in backend roles dealing with graph data.
- [Apple](/company/apple) – in mapping or services infrastructure teams.

## Study Tips

1. **Memorize the Conditions and Algorithm** – Know the degree checks for circuits and paths in both directed and undirected graphs by heart. Implement Hierholzer’s algorithm from scratch without hesitation.
2. **Practice the Key Variations** – Focus on “Reconstruct Itinerary” and “Cracking the Safe” (LeetCode 753). These are the most common problem frames. Understand how to adapt the algorithm when a lexical smallest path is required (sort adjacency lists).
3. **Model the Graph Explicitly** – When faced with a novel problem, write down what constitutes a “vertex” and an “edge.” The leap is usually recognizing that each “edge” must be used exactly once.
4. **Test on Small Custom Examples** – Before coding, verify your reasoning on a tiny custom graph (3-4 nodes). This catches modeling errors early.

Mastering this niche topic can give you a decisive edge in high-stakes interviews.
