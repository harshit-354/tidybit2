Postmates (now part of Uber) built its reputation on a complex logistics platform that matches delivery drivers with orders in real-time. While the company is integrated into Uber, its core technical interview challenges remain highly relevant for roles involving marketplace dynamics, geolocation, and real-time systems. The coding interview typically involves 1-2 rounds focused on algorithmic problem-solving, assessing a candidate's ability to write clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints. The problems are designed to test fundamental computer science knowledge applied to practical scenarios.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, the difficulty distribution for Postmates-style interviews is telling: **Easy (33%), Medium (67%), Hard (0%)**. This breakdown reveals a clear strategy. The absence of "Hard" LeetCode-style problems indicates the interview is less about obscure algorithms and more about consistent, reliable execution. The high percentage of Medium problems means you must demonstrate mastery over core data structures and patterns. You're expected to handle problems with slight twists or multiple steps efficiently. The single Easy problem often serves as a warm-up or a check for basic coding competency. The takeaway: depth in foundational topics beats superficial knowledge of advanced ones. Your goal is to solve Medium problems flawlessly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a clear picture of the technical skills Postmates valued: **Sorting, String, Array, Binary Search, and Math**. These are the building blocks for real-world features like ordering nearby drivers, validating addresses, managing delivery queues, and optimizing routes.

- **Sorting:** Often the first step in simplifying a problem. Know how to sort with custom comparators.
- **String:** Essential for parsing and validating input (e.g., addresses, order details). Focus on two-pointer techniques and hash maps for character counting.
- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Master in-place operations, sliding window, and prefix sums.
- **Binary Search:** Not just for sorted arrays. Critical for optimization problems like "find the minimum/maximum capacity or time" (e.g., the minimum number of delivery batches).
- **Math:** Problems often involve modular arithmetic, geometry (distance calculations), or number properties.

The most critical pattern to master is the **"Modified Binary Search"** applied to an array. This appears frequently in optimization contexts. Below is a classic template for finding the first or last occurrence of a target, a pattern easily adapted for more complex scenarios.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Look for earlier occurrence
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result
```

```javascript
function findFirstOccurrence(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  let result = -1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      result = mid;
      right = mid - 1; // Look for earlier occurrence
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public int findFirstOccurrence(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    int result = -1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            result = mid;
            right = mid - 1; // Look for earlier occurrence
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach is optimal given the clear distribution of problems.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. Solve 2-3 Easy and 3-4 Medium problems per topic. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just the solution. Implement each solution in your primary language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Shift to mixed-topic practice. Use platforms that tag problems by company. Aim for 2-3 Medium problems daily. Begin timing yourself (45 minutes per problem). Start each problem by clearly stating the brute force approach, then optimize.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Review.** Complete at least 4-6 full mock interviews (2 problems in 60 minutes). Simulate the real environment. In your final week, stop learning new topics. Re-solve your past mistakes and rehearse your problem-solving narrative aloud.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, restate the problem, give examples, and explain your planned approach (brute force first, then optimal). This turns the interview into a collaboration.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity.** A bug-free, readable Medium solution is better than a half-finished, clever Hard solution. Use meaningful variable names and write helper functions for complex logic.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** After coding, walk through your logic with a small normal case, an empty input, a large input, and any edge cases specific to the problem (e.g., duplicate values for sorting).
4.  **Connect to the Domain.** When appropriate, briefly mention how a pattern (like sorting drivers by proximity or binary searching for delivery windows) relates to Postmates's business. This shows practical insight.

Mastering these core topics and patterns will prepare you for the vast majority of challenges you'll face. Consistent, clear, and correct coding is the key.
