Getting an offer from SIG (Susquehanna International Group) means passing one of the most rigorous technical interview processes in quantitative finance. Their coding interviews are designed to assess not just raw algorithmic skill, but also clarity of thought, precision, and the ability to reason under pressure. The problems are often practical, data-intensive, and require clean, efficient implementations.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent SIG coding questions reveals a clear, challenging profile: **0% Easy, 80% Medium, 20% Hard**. This distribution is telling.

The complete absence of "Easy" problems signals that SIG expects a strong baseline competency; there are no warm-up questions. The 80% concentration on "Medium" difficulty indicates their focus on **core, high-frequency problem-solving patterns**. These aren't obscure algorithms, but the essential building blocks applied to non-trivial scenarios. The 20% "Hard" problems are your differentiators, often involving multi-step logic, optimization, or combining several core concepts. This breakdown means your preparation must be deep on fundamentals, not broad and shallow. Mastery of Medium problems is the absolute minimum bar.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be highly targeted. The top topics, in order of prevalence, are:

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect manipulations, subarray problems, and in-place operations.
- **Hash Table:** The essential tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Crucial for optimizing solutions that would otherwise be O(n²).
- **Simulation:** A SIG hallmark. You'll be given a set of rules or a process (e.g., a game, a system state) and must accurately model its evolution step-by-step. Bug-free, clean code is critical here.
- **Matrix (2D Array):** Problems involving grids, traversal (BFS/DFS), or dynamic programming on a 2D plane.
- **String:** Common for parsing input or implementing specific text-based algorithms.

The most critical pattern to master is **Hash Table + Array/Simulation**. Many SIG problems involve tracking states, counts, or positions as you iterate through a data stream or simulate a process.

For example, a classic pattern is finding a contiguous subarray that meets a specific condition (like summing to a target). The brute-force approach is O(n²). The optimal O(n) approach uses a hash map to store running sums.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    # Map: prefix_sum -> frequency of that sum seen so far
    sum_map = {0: 1}

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # If (prefix_sum - k) exists in map, a subarray with sum k ends here.
        count += sum_map.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Update the frequency of the current prefix sum.
        sum_map[prefix_sum] = sum_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumMap = new Map();
  sumMap.set(0, 1);

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    if (sumMap.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumMap.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    sumMap.set(prefixSum, (sumMap.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>();
    sumMap.put(0, 1);

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        count += sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        sumMap.put(prefixSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Focus exclusively on **Array, Hash Table, and String** problems at the Medium level. Solve 2-3 problems daily. For each, first attempt a brute-force solution, then optimize. Internalize the hash table pattern shown above. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter problems by these tags and SIG's frequency.

**Weeks 3-4: SIG-Specific Patterns & Simulation**
Dive into **Simulation and Matrix** problems. This is where SIG's character shines. Practice writing clean, step-by-step code. Handle edge cases meticulously (off-by-one errors are fatal). Begin mixing in Hard problems (1 every other day) to stretch your thinking. Start timing your sessions to mimic interview pressure.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews**
Solve complete SIG question sets without topic filters. The goal is to correctly identify which pattern (e.g., "this is a simulation with a hash map for state tracking") applies to the problem description. Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer, focusing on articulating your thought process clearly before coding. Revisit all previously solved problems to ensure recall and understanding.

## Key Tips

1.  **Clarity Over Cleverness:** SIG values readable, maintainable code. Use descriptive variable names, write helper functions for complex steps, and comment briefly to explain your logic. A correct, clear solution is better than a buggy, "clever" one.
2.  **Talk Through the Trade-offs:** When presenting your solution, explicitly state the time and space complexity of your initial idea and your optimized version. Explain _why_ you chose a hash table or a particular data structure. This demonstrates systems thinking.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Before declaring your code finished, verbally run through small, large, empty, and negative input cases. For simulation problems, walk through a few steps manually. This habit catches logical errors and impresses interviewers with your thoroughness.
4.  **Practice Under Constraints:** Use a plain text editor without auto-complete for some practice sessions. Time yourself strictly (30-45 minutes per problem). This replicates the actual interview environment and builds essential stamina.

Success in a SIG interview is built on precise execution of fundamental patterns applied to clever, practical problems. Target your preparation, prioritize clean code, and practice articulating your reasoning.
