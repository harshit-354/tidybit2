When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice. TikTok and Oracle both maintain substantial LeetCode question collections with notable similarities in their core testing areas. A direct comparison of their volumes, difficulty distributions, and topic focus reveals a clear strategy for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

TikTok's list is slightly larger at 383 total questions, compared to Oracle's 340. The breakdown by difficulty shows distinct profiles:

- **TikTok (383):** 42 Easy, 260 Medium, 81 Hard. This distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium-difficulty problems, which constitute about 68% of their list. This suggests their interviews consistently target complex problem-solving and implementation under typical interview constraints.
- **Oracle (340):** 70 Easy, 205 Medium, 65 Hard. While also Medium-heavy (≈60%), Oracle has a proportionally larger set of Easy questions. This may indicate a more graduated interview process, potentially starting with more foundational problems before escalating.

The takeaway is that both companies prioritize Medium questions, but TikTok's emphasis is more pronounced. Mastery of Medium problems is non-negotiable for both.

## Topic Overlap

The core technical focus for both companies is remarkably aligned. The top four topics for each are identical:

1.  **Array**
2.  **String**
3.  **Hash Table**
4.  **Dynamic Programming**

This overlap is significant. It means a strong foundation in these areas serves as dual preparation. Arrays and Strings are the bedrock for data manipulation, Hash Tables are essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting, and Dynamic Programming tests optimal substructure and state management for complex problems.

You will likely encounter problems that combine these areas, such as using a Hash Table to optimize a substring search within a String or applying DP to an Array sequence.

```python
# Example: A common pattern combining Hash Table & Array/String
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Dynamic Programming on an Array
def maxSubArray(nums):
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    max_sum = dp[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
// Example: A common pattern combining Hash Table & Array/String
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Dynamic Programming on an Array
function maxSubArray(nums) {
  let dp = new Array(nums.length);
  dp[0] = nums[0];
  let maxSum = dp[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i], dp[i - 1] + nums[i]);
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common pattern combining Hash Table & Array/String
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Dynamic Programming on an Array
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    int maxSum = dp[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i]);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the high degree of overlap, you should **prepare for TikTok and Oracle concurrently**. Focus your primary energy on mastering Medium-difficulty problems for the core four topics: Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming.

A practical study plan:

1.  **Build Foundation:** Start with the shared Easy/Medium problems from both lists to solidify understanding of the core topics.
2.  **Depth on Mediums:** Prioritize solving all Medium problems from TikTok's list. Its larger volume provides extensive practice, which will more than cover Oracle's Medium focus.
3.  **Targeted Hard Problems:** Finally, tackle the Hard problems, particularly from TikTok, as they represent the upper bound of complexity you might face.

This approach maximizes efficiency. By focusing on the more demanding TikTok list, you inherently prepare for Oracle's slightly less intense distribution. The shared topics mean your practice is never wasted.
