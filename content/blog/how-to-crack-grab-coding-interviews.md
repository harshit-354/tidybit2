Grab’s coding interviews are a direct assessment of your problem-solving speed and engineering precision. As a superapp spanning rides, food, payments, and more, Grab’s technical challenges often mirror real-world scenarios involving data flows, user interactions, and system efficiency. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or CodeSignal, followed by deeper technical discussions. Success hinges on a clear, methodical approach and mastery of a well-defined set of core patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 15 recent Grab coding questions reveals a clear emphasis on practical, solvable problems:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (13%)
- **Medium:** 13 questions (87%)
- **Hard:** 0 questions (0%)

This distribution is strategic. Grab isn't primarily testing for esoteric algorithm knowledge; they are evaluating how reliably you can dissect a common software engineering problem under pressure and implement a robust, optimal solution within 45 minutes. The absence of "Hard" problems is telling—your goal isn't to conquer impossibly complex puzzles, but to demonstrate consistent, flawless execution on high-frequency Medium challenges. Missing an edge case or arriving at a suboptimal `O(n²)` solution for a standard array problem is a bigger risk here than failing to solve a dynamic programming monster.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be intensely focused. The vast majority of questions fall into these five categories.

**Array & String Manipulation:** The bedrock of Grab's questions. Expect tasks involving traversal, partitioning, sliding windows, and in-place modifications, simulating data processing for user locations, transaction logs, or text parsing.

**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving `O(1)` lookups to optimize nested loops. It's indispensable for frequency counting, mapping relationships (e.g., user ID to session data), and validating conditions across datasets.

**Dynamic Programming:** A critical topic for optimization problems, such as finding the most efficient path (relevant for delivery routing), maximizing value within constraints, or counting ways to decode a message (like a payment confirmation code).

**Stack:** Essential for problems involving nested structures, parsing, and "next greater element" patterns. Think of validating sequences (e.g., user action logs) or evaluating expressions, which can be analogous to processing nested API calls or configuration rules.

The most frequent pattern across these topics is the **Sliding Window**, particularly for Array/String problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. Mastering it is non-negotiable.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray_sum_fixed(nums, k):
    """Example: Maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(nums) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSubarraySumFixed(nums, k) {
  if (nums.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = nums.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubarraySumFixed(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: **Foundation.** Drill the top 5 topics exclusively. For each, learn the 2-3 most common patterns (e.g., for Array: Sliding Window, Two Pointers; for DP: 1D Knapsack, Longest Increasing Subsequence). Solve 15-20 foundational Medium problems, ensuring you can code them from scratch.

Weeks 3-4: **Integration & Speed.** Start solving complete, random Medium problems tagged for Grab or similar companies. Time every session (45 minutes max). Practice verbalizing your thought process before coding. This week is about building consistency and pattern recognition speed.

Weeks 5-6: **Mock Interviews & Polish.** Conduct at least 4-5 timed mock interviews with a peer or using platform tools. Simulate the exact environment. Revisit and re-solve any problems you previously struggled with. Focus on writing clean, commented code with proper edge-case handling from the first line.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Always spend the first 2-3 minutes restating the problem, confirming edge cases (empty input? large numbers?), and outlining your approach. This demonstrates structured thinking and can catch misunderstandings early.
2.  **Optimize Deliberately:** Start with a brute-force solution only if you immediately explain its inefficiency and state you will optimize. For Grab's Medium problems, the optimal solution is usually expected. Aim for the best time/space complexity your initial plan allows.
3.  **Test with Purpose:** Don't just run the example. Verbally walk through a small custom test case, including edge cases, before execution. Explain what you're testing for (e.g., "This checks the case where the window shrinks to size zero").
4.  **Practice in the Interview Language:** Use one primary language (Python, JavaScript, or Java) for all your practice and the interview. Fluency with its standard library (especially for Hash Tables and Arrays) saves critical minutes.
