When preparing for technical interviews at large tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution of their questions can significantly streamline your study process. IBM and Walmart Labs, while both being major employers with rigorous technical interviews, exhibit distinct patterns in their question selection, difficulty distribution, and core topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their profiles to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers reveal different strategic approaches to candidate assessment.

IBM's dataset contains **170 questions**, with a difficulty distribution skewed heavily toward foundational concepts: **52 Easy**, **102 Medium**, and **16 Hard** questions. This breakdown suggests IBM's interviews frequently start with accessible problems to assess core competency and problem-solving approach before progressing to more complex, medium-difficulty challenges. The relatively low number of Hard questions indicates that while advanced problems may appear, the interview is not primarily a gauntlet of extreme complexity.

Walmart Labs, with **152 questions**, presents a more challenging overall profile: **22 Easy**, **105 Medium**, and **25 Hard** questions. The stark reduction in Easy questions and the significant increase in Hard questions compared to IBM points to an interview process that moves quickly into substantial algorithmic problems. The high concentration of Medium-difficulty questions forms the backbone of their assessment, demanding strong, consistent performance on standard algorithmic challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with a clear divergence in secondary focus.

**IBM's Core Topics** are Array, String, Two Pointers, and Sorting. This combination highlights a focus on **data manipulation and ordered data processing**. Two Pointers and Sorting are often used together to solve problems involving searching, deduplication, or meeting specific conditions within sequences. The emphasis is on clean, efficient handling of linear data structures.

**Walmart Labs' Core Topics** are Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (DP). The inclusion of **Hash Table and DP** signals a shift toward problems involving **lookup optimization and stateful computation**. Hash Table questions test your ability to trade space for time to achieve O(1) lookups, while DP problems assess skills in breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems, a common requirement for optimization challenges.

The common ground is Array and String problems. However, IBM is more likely to test your ability to sort and traverse these structures with two pointers, whereas Walmart Labs is more likely to ask you to use a hash map for frequency counting or to apply dynamic programming to a string-based problem like "Longest Palindromic Substring."

```python
# IBM-style: Two Pointers on a Sorted Array (e.g., Two Sum II)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Walmart Labs-style: Hash Table (e.g., Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// IBM-style: Two Pointers on a Sorted Array
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    else if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Walmart Labs-style: Hash Table
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// IBM-style: Two Pointers on a Sorted Array
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Walmart Labs-style: Hash Table
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and current skill level.

If you are **new to technical interviews** or seeking to build a strong foundation, **start with IBM's question profile**. The higher volume of Easy questions provides a gentler on-ramp to practice core concepts like array manipulation and string processing. Mastering Two Pointers and Sorting techniques on these easier problems will build essential skills that are transferable to any interview. Once comfortable, you can tackle their large set of Medium questions, which will solidify your problem-solving approach.

If you are already **comfortable with Easy and common Medium problems** and are specifically targeting Walmart Labs or similar companies, you should **prioritize their profile**. Begin by solidifying your understanding of Hash Table applications and then move directly into rigorous Dynamic Programming practice. The scarcity of Easy questions in their set means you must be prepared to perform under pressure on Medium and Hard problems from the outset. Focus on high-frequency DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.) and complex array/hash map combinations.

Ultimately, a robust preparation for either company will involve mastering Arrays and Strings. The key differentiator is the secondary skill set: efficient traversal and ordering for IBM versus optimal lookup and state optimization for Walmart Labs.
