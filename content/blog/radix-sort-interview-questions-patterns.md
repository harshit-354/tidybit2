# Radix Sort Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Radix sort is a specialized non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that frequently appears in coding interviews despite its narrow use case. Interviewers don't test it to see if you can implement textbook sorting—they want to assess your understanding of when to apply specialized tools over general ones. The algorithm's O(nk) time complexity (where k is the number of digits) makes it optimal for sorting integers with bounded digit length, particularly in problems involving large datasets with fixed-width keys.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Fixed-Width Integer Sorting

When you need to sort integers with a known maximum digit length, radix sort outperforms comparison-based sorts. The pattern involves counting sort as a stable subroutine for each digit position.

```python
def counting_sort(arr, exp):
    n = len(arr)
    output = [0] * n
    count = [0] * 10

    for i in range(n):
        index = arr[i] // exp
        count[index % 10] += 1

    for i in range(1, 10):
        count[i] += count[i - 1]

    i = n - 1
    while i >= 0:
        index = arr[i] // exp
        output[count[index % 10] - 1] = arr[i]
        count[index % 10] -= 1
        i -= 1

    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = output[i]

def radix_sort(arr):
    max_val = max(arr)
    exp = 1
    while max_val // exp > 0:
        counting_sort(arr, exp)
        exp *= 10
    return arr
```

```javascript
function countingSort(arr, exp) {
  const n = arr.length;
  const output = new Array(n).fill(0);
  const count = new Array(10).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const index = Math.floor(arr[i] / exp);
    count[index % 10]++;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    count[i] += count[i - 1];
  }

  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const index = Math.floor(arr[i] / exp);
    output[count[index % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
    count[index % 10]--;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = output[i];
  }
}

function radixSort(arr) {
  const maxVal = Math.max(...arr);
  let exp = 1;
  while (Math.floor(maxVal / exp) > 0) {
    countingSort(arr, exp);
    exp *= 10;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

```java
public void countingSort(int[] arr, int exp) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int[] output = new int[n];
    int[] count = new int[10];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int index = arr[i] / exp;
        count[index % 10]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        count[i] += count[i - 1];
    }

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int index = arr[i] / exp;
        output[count[index % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
        count[index % 10]--;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = output[i];
    }
}

public void radixSort(int[] arr) {
    int maxVal = Arrays.stream(arr).max().getAsInt();
    for (int exp = 1; maxVal / exp > 0; exp *= 10) {
        countingSort(arr, exp);
    }
}
```

### 2. String Sorting by Character Position

Radix sort extends to strings when sorting lexicographically by character position from least significant to most significant. This pattern appears in problems involving fixed-length strings or dictionary ordering.

### 3. Multi-Pass Processing with Buckets

Each digit pass uses buckets (0-9) to group elements. This pattern teaches you to think about data distribution and stable sorting properties, which are valuable for problems requiring preservation of relative order.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows 100% medium difficulty questions—zero easy or hard problems. This distribution reveals how interviewers use radix sort: not as a trivial implementation exercise, but as a conceptual tool within broader problems. Medium difficulty means you'll typically need to:

- Recognize when radix sort is the optimal approach among alternatives
- Adapt the algorithm to constraints like negative numbers or variable-length elements
- Integrate radix sort as a component within a larger solution

You won't be asked to implement vanilla radix sort from scratch; you'll need to apply its principles to solve problems efficiently.

## Which Companies Ask Radix Sort

Top technology companies include radix sort in their interviews to test algorithmic thinking:

- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – Tests for large-scale data processing scenarios
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – Appears in financial data sorting problems
- [Google](/company/google) – Used in system design and optimization questions
- [Meta](/company/meta) – Appears in problems involving user ID sorting or ranking
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) – Tests understanding of non-comparative sorting advantages

These companies value candidates who can select specialized algorithms for specific constraints rather than always defaulting to general-purpose solutions.

## Study Tips

1. **Understand the trade-offs**: Memorize that radix sort is O(nk) where k is digit length. It beats O(n log n) comparison sorts only when k < log n. Practice identifying when this condition holds.

2. **Practice the counting sort subroutine**: Since counting sort is the stable subroutine for each digit place, implement it flawlessly. Handle edge cases like negative numbers by adding a minimum value offset.

3. **Recognize fixed-width patterns**: Look for problems involving phone numbers, ZIP codes, fixed-length IDs, or timestamps—these often have bounded digit lengths where radix sort excels.

4. **Compare with bucket sort**: Know when to use radix sort (fixed digit positions) versus bucket sort (uniform distribution). Interviewers often ask about this distinction.

Master these patterns and you'll recognize when to deploy radix sort during interviews, turning a specialized algorithm into a competitive advantage.
