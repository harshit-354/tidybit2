When preparing for technical interviews at major tech and consulting firms, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company's question bank is crucial. Oracle and Accenture, while both large players in the technology sector, have distinct interview processes reflected in their coding question profiles. Oracle, a product-based tech giant, emphasizes deep algorithmic problem-solving. Accenture, a global professional services and consulting firm, tends to focus on practical, foundational coding skills applied to business problems. A strategic preparation plan should account for their differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most immediate difference. Oracle's list of **340 questions** is significantly larger than Accenture's **144 questions**. This suggests Oracle's interview process may draw from a broader, more unpredictable pool of problems, requiring wider preparation.

The difficulty distribution reveals their core focus:

- **Oracle (E70/M205/H65):** Medium difficulty questions dominate, comprising over 60% of the question bank. The substantial number of Hard questions (65) signals that interviews for many roles, especially engineering-focused positions, will test advanced algorithmic mastery and optimization.
- **Accenture (E65/M68/H11):** The difficulty skews heavily toward foundational levels. Easy questions are the largest category, and Hard questions are minimal (only 11). This aligns with Accenture's consulting and implementation focus, where clarity, correctness, and maintainable code for business logic are often prioritized over crafting the most optimal algorithm for a niche case.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** manipulations. These are the bedrock of practical coding. A problem common to both lists might involve counting or transforming data using these structures.

```python
# Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string (Array/Hash Table)
def first_uniq_char(s: str) -> int:
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if count[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string (Array/Hash Table)
function firstUniqChar(s) {
  const count = new Map();
  for (const char of s) {
    count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (count.get(s[i]) === 1) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string (Array/Hash Table)
public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (count.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

The key divergence is in the advanced topics. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a major topic for Oracle but is not highlighted for Accenture. DP problems are classic medium/hard challenges that test a candidate's ability to break down complex problems and optimize overlapping subproblems—a critical skill for systems-level engineering. Conversely, **Math** is a noted topic for Accenture, indicating a higher likelihood of problems involving numerical properties, basic arithmetic logic, or simulation, which are common in business application scenarios.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Accenture first** if you are interviewing at both companies. Its question bank is smaller and less skewed toward hard problems. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Math) to solve Easy and Medium problems efficiently will build a solid foundation. This preparation covers a significant portion of Accenture's likely questions and establishes the fundamentals needed for Oracle.

Then, pivot to **Oracle preparation**. Use the established core skills and systematically tackle Medium-difficulty problems across all topics, especially focusing on Dynamic Programming. Finally, practice a selection of Hard problems to build the stamina and advanced pattern recognition required for Oracle's more rigorous technical rounds. This sequential approach ensures you are broadly prepared without being overwhelmed, allowing you to solidify fundamentals before tackling higher-complexity challenges.
