When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Amazon and Infosys, while both major tech employers, have distinctly different interview processes reflected in their question banks. Amazon's process is notoriously rigorous and algorithm-heavy, designed to assess problem-solving under pressure for roles often involving scalable systems. Infosys, a global consulting and IT services firm, tends to focus on foundational coding skills, logical reasoning, and problem-solving applicable to a wide range of client projects. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most immediate difference. Amazon's curated list of approximately **1,938 questions** dwarfs Infosys's **158 questions**. This doesn't mean you must master all 1,938, but it indicates a vast problem space and a deep, well-established interview culture focused on algorithmic depth.

The difficulty distribution reveals their core priorities:

- **Amazon (E530 / M1057 / H351):** The curve is weighted toward **Medium and Hard** problems. Medium questions (1,057) form the bulk, testing a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms under typical interview constraints. The significant number of Hard problems (351) signals that for many roles, especially at senior levels or within specific teams, you must be prepared for complex optimization challenges.
- **Infosys (E42 / M82 / H34):** The distribution is more balanced relative to its size, but still leans toward Medium difficulty. The emphasis is likely on **solid foundational competency**. The lower total and relatively fewer Hard questions suggest the interview is designed to filter for core programming logic and problem-solving ability rather than advanced algorithmic mastery.

```python
# Example of a common 'Medium' difficulty pattern: Fast & Slow Pointer
def hasCycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

```javascript
// Example of a common 'Medium' difficulty pattern: Fast & Slow Pointer
function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

```java
// Example of a common 'Medium' difficulty pattern: Fast & Slow Pointer
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Dynamic Programming**, confirming these as universal pillars of coding interviews.

- **Amazon's Focus:** The prominent inclusion of **Hash Table** as a top topic is telling. It underscores Amazon's emphasis on **optimal time complexity** (often O(1) or O(n) lookups) for problems involving counting, frequency, or matching. Questions often involve combining hash maps with other techniques to solve problems efficiently, a key skill for working with large-scale data.
- **Infosys's Focus:** The prominence of **Math** as a top category points toward a focus on **logical reasoning, numerical puzzles, and basic algorithmic number theory**. This aligns with a broader IT services context where clean, logical solutions to well-defined problems are highly valued.

In essence, Amazon's topics lean toward building efficient, scalable systems, while Infosys's topics lean toward applied problem-solving and logical deduction.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your target role and the transferability of skills.

**Prepare for Infosys First if:** You are early in your coding interview journey. The smaller, more foundational question bank provides a manageable scope. Mastering the core topics here—especially Array, String, and basic Dynamic Programming—builds a solid platform. The skills are **100% transferable** to Amazon's easier problems and form the baseline for tackling more complex challenges.

**Prepare for Amazon First if:** Your primary goal is to pass Amazon's interview, or you are already comfortable with core data structures. Amazon's preparation is more intensive and comprehensive. Successfully practicing for its Medium and Hard problems will make Infosys's question bank feel like a subset, effectively covering its entire spectrum of difficulty. The depth required for Amazon naturally encompasses the breadth needed for Infosys.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Start with a **strong foundation** using the Infosys topic list. Ensure you are proficient in solving Easy and Medium problems on Arrays, Strings, and DP. Then, **transition to Amazon-focused practice** to ramp up difficulty, deeply integrate hash table techniques, and build the stamina for longer, more complex problem-solving sessions. This approach ensures no gaps in your fundamental knowledge while systematically raising your ceiling.
