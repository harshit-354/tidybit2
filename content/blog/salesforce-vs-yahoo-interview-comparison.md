When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution of their question banks can significantly streamline your study process. Salesforce and Yahoo, while both established in the tech industry, present distinct interview landscapes. Salesforce's process is known for its breadth and algorithmic rigor, whereas Yahoo's (now under the umbrella of Verizon Media and Apollo) tends to focus on foundational concepts with a more approachable difficulty curve. This comparison analyzes their question volumes, difficulty distributions, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most immediate difference. Salesforce's list of **189 questions** is nearly triple the size of Yahoo's **64 questions**. This suggests that Salesforce has a more extensive and potentially varied interview question repository, requiring broader preparation.

The difficulty distribution reveals their different technical bars:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium (113 questions)** and includes a significant number of **Hard (49 questions)**. This indicates that passing a Salesforce interview typically requires strong problem-solving skills, comfort with complex algorithm design, and the ability to optimize solutions under pressure.
- **Yahoo (E26/M32/H6):** The distribution skews heavily toward **Easy (26 questions)** and **Medium (32 questions)**, with only a handful of **Hard (6 questions)**. This profile suggests Yahoo interviews focus on assessing solid foundational knowledge, clean code, and the ability to reason through typical problems, with less emphasis on solving highly complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, with significant overlap in their top four topics: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (Salesforce) / Sorting (Yahoo)**.

- **Shared Core (Array, String, Hash Table):** Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either company. Expect questions on array manipulation, string processing, and leveraging hash maps for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

  ```python
  # Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
  def two_sum(nums, target):
      seen = {}
      for i, num in enumerate(nums):
          complement = target - num
          if complement in seen:
              return [seen[complement], i]
          seen[num] = i
      return []
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
  function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      const complement = target - nums[i];
      if (map.has(complement)) {
        return [map.get(complement), i];
      }
      map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return [];
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
  public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
      Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          int complement = target - nums[i];
          if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
              return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
          }
          map.put(nums[i], i);
      }
      return new int[0];
  }
  ```

- **Key Differentiator:**
  - **Salesforce** prominently includes **Dynamic Programming**. Preparing for Salesforce means you must practice DP patterns for problems involving optimization, counting, or decision-making across sequences (strings, arrays) or grids.
  - **Yahoo** highlights **Sorting**. While sorting is a fundamental concept, its specific mention suggests a focus on problems where sorting is the key insight or where you must implement/compare sorting approaches.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prioritize based on your target companies and timeline.

If your goal is to pass **Yahoo** interviews, start there. The smaller question bank and lower proportion of Hard questions make it an achievable first milestone. Solidify your understanding of arrays, strings, hash tables, and sorting algorithms. This foundation will build your confidence and cover a large portion of their likely questions.

You should prepare for **Salesforce** first only if it is your primary target. The preparation is more demanding due to the volume and difficulty. Tackling Salesforce's list will force you to master medium-difficulty problems and delve into dynamic programming, which is a challenging but valuable skill set. Successfully preparing for Salesforce will inherently cover the core concepts needed for Yahoo, making a subsequent Yahoo-focused review relatively quick.

In summary, use Yahoo preparation to build a strong foundation. Use Salesforce preparation to reach an advanced, interview-ready level of algorithmic proficiency. Tailor your study plan to the company that best matches your current skill level and career goals.
