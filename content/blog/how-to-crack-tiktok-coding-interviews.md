TikTok (ByteDance) has rapidly emerged as one of the most competitive employers in tech, and its interview process reflects that ambition. The typical loop includes a recruiter screen, two to three technical phone interviews, and a virtual on-site of three to four coding rounds. Each coding round lasts about 50 to 60 minutes, and you are usually expected to solve one to two problems per round. TikTok's interview style leans toward the harder side of the spectrum — the company has a reputation for asking challenging algorithmic problems, and its interviewers are often less forgiving with hints compared to some other companies.

One distinctive aspect of TikTok interviews is the influence of competitive programming culture from ByteDance's Chinese engineering roots. Problems can feel more algorithmic and less "practical" than what you would see at Amazon or Bloomberg. If you are comfortable with contest-style problems, you have an advantage here.

## By the Numbers

TikTok's question pool is smaller but much more concentrated than the big four, with **383 questions** reported. The difficulty distribution immediately stands out:

- **Easy: 42 questions (11%)**
- **Medium: 260 questions (68%)**
- **Hard: 81 questions (21%)**

Only 11% easy — the lowest among all major tech companies. A staggering 68% medium and 21% hard means that nearly 9 out of 10 problems you will face are medium or hard. This is not a company where you can coast on easy fundamentals. You need to be genuinely comfortable with medium-to-hard problems to succeed at TikTok.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Arrays** — As with most companies, arrays are the foundation. TikTok array problems tend to be on the harder side, often requiring advanced techniques like binary search on answer, prefix sums combined with other data structures, or multi-pass approaches.

A classic example is finding the minimum size subarray sum that meets or exceeds a target. This uses the sliding window technique, a fundamental pattern for array problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def min_subarray_len(target, nums):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1

    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

```javascript
function minSubArrayLen(target, nums) {
  let left = 0;
  let currentSum = 0;
  let minLength = Infinity;

  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    currentSum += nums[right];
    while (currentSum >= target) {
      minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
      currentSum -= nums[left];
      left++;
    }
  }

  return minLength === Infinity ? 0 : minLength;
}
```

```java
public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
    int left = 0;
    int currentSum = 0;
    int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        currentSum += nums[right];
        while (currentSum >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            currentSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
}
```

**Strings** — String problems at TikTok go beyond basic manipulation. Expect problems involving complex pattern matching, string-based DP, and parsing challenges. These often require combining string techniques with other algorithmic concepts.

A common medium-hard string problem is checking if a string can be segmented into words from a given dictionary. This is typically solved with dynamic programming or memoized DFS.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def word_break(s, word_dict):
    word_set = set(word_dict)
    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
    dp[0] = True  # empty string can be segmented

    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break

    return dp[len(s)]
```

```javascript
function wordBreak(s, wordDict) {
  const wordSet = new Set(wordDict);
  const dp = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(false);
  dp[0] = true;

  for (let i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (dp[j] && wordSet.has(s.substring(j, i))) {
        dp[i] = true;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[s.length];
}
```

```java
public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
    Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordDict);
    boolean[] dp = new boolean[s.length() + 1];
    dp[0] = true;

    for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(s.substring(j, i))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[s.length()];
}
```

</div>

**Hash Tables** — Hash-based solutions are critical for achieving the time complexity that TikTok problems demand. Many of TikTok's medium and hard problems have solutions that hinge on clever use of hash maps for state tracking or memoization.

A classic problem that demonstrates the power of hash tables is finding the longest substring without repeating characters. The optimal solution uses a hash map to track the last seen index of each character.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1
        char_index[char] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLength;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

</div>

**Dynamic Programming** — DP is a major focus at TikTok, consistent with ByteDance's competitive programming DNA. Expect problems that go beyond textbook patterns — interval DP, bitmask DP, DP on trees, and problems where identifying the correct state and transition requires real insight. If you are weak in DP, TikTok interviews will expose that quickly.

The classic 0/1 knapsack problem is fundamental to understanding DP. Here's the bottom-up implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w],
                              dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]] + values[i-1])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]

    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i-1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w],
                                   dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]] + values[i-1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

</div>

**Depth-First Search** — DFS and recursion-based problems appear with notable frequency. Graph traversal, backtracking, tree DFS variants, and problems requiring exhaustive search with pruning are all fair game. TikTok sometimes combines DFS with memoization, blurring the line between recursion and DP.

A classic DFS problem is finding all permutations of an array. This demonstrates backtracking, which is essential for many TikTok problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def permute(nums):
    def backtrack(path, used):
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            result.append(path[:])
            return

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if not used[i]:
                used[i] = True
                path.append(nums[i])
                backtrack(path, used)
                path.pop()
                used[i] = False

    result = []
    backtrack([], [False] * len(nums))
    return result
```

```javascript
function permute(nums) {
  const result = [];

  function backtrack(path, used) {
    if (path.length === nums.length) {
      result.push([...path]);
      return;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      if (!used[i]) {
        used[i] = true;
        path.push(nums[i]);
        backtrack(path, used);
        path.pop();
        used[i] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  backtrack([], new Array(nums.length).fill(false));
  return result;
}
```

```java
public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    boolean[] used = new boolean[nums.length];
    backtrack(nums, new ArrayList<>(), used, result);
    return result;
}

private void backtrack(int[] nums, List<Integer> path,
                      boolean[] used, List<List<Integer>> result) {
    if (path.size() == nums.length) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (!used[i]) {
            used[i] = true;
            path.add(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, path, used, result);
            path.remove(path.size() - 1);
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy

**Weeks 1-2: Strengthen the Fundamentals at Medium Level.** Because TikTok skews hard, your baseline needs to be solid. Solve 8-10 medium problems per day across arrays, strings, and hash tables. Time yourself strictly — under 20 minutes per medium. If you are spending more than that, you need to drill more before moving on. Skip easy problems entirely in your practice; they will not prepare you for what TikTok asks.

**Week 3: Dynamic Programming Intensive.** Dedicate a full week to DP. Start with standard patterns (1D, 2D, knapsack), but quickly move to advanced variants: interval DP, DP with bitmasks, DP on strings, and tree DP. Solve at least 35 DP problems this week, including 10 hard-level ones. For each problem, write out the state definition and recurrence relation before coding.

Here's an example of a more advanced DP problem: counting the number of unique binary search trees given n nodes (Catalan numbers).

<div class="code-group">

```python
def num_trees(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]

    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function numTrees(n) {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
    }
  }

  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int numTrees(int n) {
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

**Week 4: DFS, BFS, and Graph Algorithms.** Cover all major graph algorithms: DFS, BFS, topological sort, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), union-find, and connected components. TikTok frequently combines graph traversal with other concepts, so practice hybrid problems — for example, BFS with DP or DFS with binary search.

Here's an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph:

<div class="code-group">

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_dist > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_dist + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances
```

```javascript
function dijkstra(graph, start) {
  const distances = {};
  const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: (x) => x.distance });

  for (const node in graph) {
    distances[node] = Infinity;
  }
  distances[start] = 0;
  pq.enqueue({ node: start, distance: 0 });

  while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    const { node: current, distance: currentDist } = pq.dequeue().element;

    if (currentDist > distances[current]) continue;

    for (const [neighbor, weight] of Object.entries(graph[current])) {
      const distance = currentDist + weight;
      if (distance < distances[neighbor]) {
        distances[neighbor] = distance;
        pq.enqueue({ node: neighbor, distance });
      }
    }
  }

  return distances;
}
```

```java
public Map<Integer, Integer> dijkstra(Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> graph, int start) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
    PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);

    for (int node : graph.keySet()) {
        distances.put(node, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    distances.put(start, 0);
    pq.offer(new int[]{start, 0});

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        int[] current = pq.poll();
        int currentNode = current[0];
        int currentDist = current[1];

        if (currentDist > distances.get(currentNode)) continue;

        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> neighbor : graph.get(currentNode).entrySet()) {
            int nextNode = neighbor.getKey();
            int weight = neighbor.getValue();
            int distance = currentDist + weight;

            if (distance < distances.get(nextNode)) {
                distances.put(nextNode, distance);
                pq.offer(new int[]{nextNode, distance});
            }
        }
    }

    return distances;
}
```

</div>

**Week 5: Advanced Topics and Hard Problems.** This week is about pushing your ceiling. Practice segment trees, binary indexed trees, monotonic stacks and queues, and advanced string algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp). Solve 5 hard problems per day from random topics. The goal is to build comfort with problems that do not fit neatly into a single category.

Here's an implementation of a monotonic stack to find the next greater element for each element in an array:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def next_greater_elements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # stores indices

    for i in range(n * 2):
        idx = i % n
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[idx]:
            result[stack.pop()] = nums[idx]
        if i < n:
            stack.append(idx)

    return result
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // stores indices

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    const idx = i % n;
    while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < nums[idx]) {
      result[stack.pop()] = nums[idx];
    }
    if (i < n) {
      stack.push(idx);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
        int idx = i % n;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[idx]) {
            result[stack.pop()] = nums[idx];
        }
        if (i < n) {
            stack.push(idx);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

</div>

**Week 6: Mock Interviews Under Pressure.** Run 5-6 full mock interviews simulating TikTok's format: 50-60 minutes, two problems, no hints. If possible, find practice partners who are also preparing for competitive-style interviews. Review every problem you failed or solved slowly, and identify the conceptual gap.

## Key Tips

1. **Do not rely on pattern matching alone.** TikTok problems often combine multiple techniques in ways that resist simple pattern recognition. You need to understand the underlying principles, not just memorize solutions. For example, a problem might require using binary search on the answer combined with a greedy validation function, or DFS with memoization that's essentially DP.

2. **Master DP or expect to struggle.** With DP being a top topic and the overall difficulty skewing hard, weak DP skills are a deal-breaker at TikTok. Invest disproportionate time in this area. Practice not just implementing DP solutions but also deriving the recurrence relation from scratch. Common DP patterns at TikTok include:
   - Longest Increasing Subsequence variants
   - Edit distance and string alignment problems
   - Partition problems (like palindrome partitioning)
   - Bitmask DP for subset problems

3. **Practice writing optimal solutions from the start.** TikTok interviewers are less likely to accept a brute force solution and then help you optimize. Come in with the optimal approach, or at least a clear path to get there. This means you need to quickly analyze time and space complexity during your thinking process.

4. **Be prepared for the time pressure.** Two problems in 50-60 minutes with harder-than-average difficulty means you cannot afford to get stuck. If you are not making progress on a problem within 5-7 minutes, step back, reconsider your approach, and try a different angle. Develop a systematic approach: understand the problem, devise a plan, implement, then test with edge cases.

5. **Study competitive programming resources.** Because TikTok's problems lean toward the competitive programming style, resources like Codeforces editorials and competitive programming handbooks can supplement your LeetCode practice effectively. Pay special attention to:
   - Number theory and combinatorics
   - Graph theory algorithms beyond basic BFS/DFS
   - Advanced data structures (segment trees, Fenwick trees)
   - Two-pointer and sliding window variations
