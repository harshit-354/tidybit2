Point72’s coding interviews are a direct assessment of your ability to solve practical, data-centric problems under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including a technical phone screen and on-site interviews, focusing heavily on your analytical reasoning and coding fundamentals rather than obscure computer science trivia. Success here means demonstrating clean, efficient code and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear, skills-focused profile: **60% Easy** and **40% Medium** questions, with **0% Hard**. This breakdown is strategic. Point72 isn't trying to filter candidates with impossible puzzles; they are testing for consistency, accuracy, and the ability to handle the core technical work. The absence of "Hard" problems means you should prioritize mastering fundamentals over grinding advanced algorithms. The high percentage of "Easy" questions is deceptive—these are often used as a baseline filter. Sloppy code or a slow solution on an Easy problem is a quick rejection. The Medium questions are where you differentiate yourself by showing efficient data handling and optimal patterns.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows one dominant area: **Database** questions are the top topic. You must be fluent in SQL and understanding data relationships.

**Database (SQL)**
This is non-negotiable. Expect to write complex queries involving multiple JOINs, aggregation with GROUP BY, and filtering with HAVING. Understanding window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) is a significant advantage. Practice questions that involve calculating running totals, deduplicating records, or finding top-N per category.

The most important pattern here is the **self-join or window function for comparative analysis**, such as finding duplicates or comparing rows within the same table.

<div class="code-group">

```sql
-- Example: Find all duplicate emails in a Person table using a window function.
SELECT email
FROM (
    SELECT email,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) as row_num
    FROM Person
) ranked
WHERE row_num > 1;
```

```sql
-- The same logic in a standard GROUP BY/HAVING pattern.
SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

</div>

**Array/String Manipulation**
While not the top topic by volume, these form the basis of many Easy/Medium coding questions. You must handle edge cases flawlessly.

**Sorting & Searching**
Understand binary search variations and how to apply sorting as a pre-processing step to simplify problems. Know the time/space complexity of your sorts.

**Hash Tables (Dictionaries/Maps)**
This is your primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups and solving "find the pair" or "count frequencies" problems efficiently. The pattern is universal.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum using a hash map.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum using a hash map.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum using a hash map.
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & SQL Mastery**

- **Days 1-7:** Drill 20-30 LeetCode Easy problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Focus on bug-free, optimal solutions.
- **Days 8-14:** Dedicate this entire week to SQL. Use platforms like LeetCode or StrataScratch. Complete 40-50 problems covering every type of JOIN, aggregation, subquery, and window function. Build mental models for translating business questions into SQL logic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Recognition & Medium Problems**

- Systematically study core patterns: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, and basic DFS/BFS for tree traversal.
- Solve 30-40 Medium problems, applying these patterns. Mix in 2-3 SQL problems daily to keep the skill sharp.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Point72 Focus**

- Stop learning new topics. Conduct at least 8-10 timed mock interviews (use Pramp, interviewing.io, or a peer).
- Simulate the Point72 style: explain your thought process aloud, write clean code first, then optimize. Revisit all your SQL solutions.
- In the final days, solve only Easy problems to build speed and confidence for that 60% portion of the interview.

## Key Tips

1.  **SQL is a First-Class Language:** Treat SQL preparation with the same intensity as Python or Java. Write it out by hand; know the difference between `RANK` and `DENSE_RANK`.
2.  **Optimize for Readability First:** For Easy/Medium problems, a clear, slightly sub-optimal solution is better than a clever, unreadable one. Use descriptive variable names and add brief comments for complex logic.
3.  **Communicate the "Why":** Always articulate your reasoning before coding. For a database question, explain why you chose a LEFT JOIN over an INNER JOIN, or why a window function is more efficient than a correlated subquery.
4.  **Practice with Time Pressure:** Use a timer for every practice problem. Point72’s interviews are timed; you need to identify the approach and code a solution within 25-30 minutes.
5.  **Test Your Own Code:** After writing your solution, verbally walk through a test case, including edge cases (empty input, duplicates, negative numbers). This shows thoroughness.

Mastering these fundamentals and demonstrating consistent, clean execution is how you crack the Point72 coding interview.
