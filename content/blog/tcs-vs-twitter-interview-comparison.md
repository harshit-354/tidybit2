When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and Twitter (now X) represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in software engineering hiring, from large-scale services consulting to a focused social media product. Their publicly available question profiles reveal significant differences in strategy, which directly impact how you should prepare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most immediate difference. TCS's profile lists **217 questions**, dwarfing Twitter's **53**. This suggests TCS has a broader, more generalized question bank, likely used across many roles and experience levels. The difficulty distribution is:

- **TCS:** Easy (94), Medium (103), Hard (20)
- **Twitter:** Easy (8), Medium (33), Hard (12)

The data shows that while both companies emphasize Medium-difficulty problems, TCS includes a massive number of Easy questions, often used for screening or entry-level roles. Twitter's distribution is more concentrated on challenging problems, with a higher proportion of Hard questions relative to its total. Preparing for Twitter requires deep mastery of a smaller set of complex concepts, whereas TCS preparation demands broader coverage of fundamental algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Shared Top Topics:** Array, String, Hash Table
- **TCS Addition:** Two Pointers (a specific technique often used with Arrays and Strings)
- **Twitter Addition:** Design (System Design or Object-Oriented Design)

This overlap means foundational preparation in arrays, strings, and hashing benefits both. However, the key differentiator is Twitter's inclusion of **Design**. This signals an expectation for senior or product-aware engineers who can architect scalable systems—a critical skill for a high-traffic platform like Twitter.

A Two Pointers problem, common for TCS:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

A Hash Table problem, common to both:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def first_unique_char(s):
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if count[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

```javascript
function firstUniqueChar(s) {
  const count = new Map();
  for (const char of s) {
    count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (count.get(s[i]) === 1) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (count.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **TCS**. Its vast question bank covering many Easy and Medium problems on fundamental data structures provides the perfect training ground. Mastering these will build the algorithmic muscle memory and speed required for any technical interview. It ensures you have the breadth to handle a wide variety of common problems.

Once that foundation is solid, pivot to **Twitter**. This requires deepening your understanding of Medium problems and tackling Hard ones. Most critically, you must add dedicated **System Design** preparation, which is absent from the typical TCS question profile. This shift is from breadth of knowledge to depth and architectural thinking.

In summary, use TCS's profile for comprehensive algorithmic drill. Use Twitter's profile for focused, high-depth practice and to gate your preparation with design study.
