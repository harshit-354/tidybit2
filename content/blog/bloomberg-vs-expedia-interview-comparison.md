When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Bloomberg and Expedia represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of question volume and focus, despite sharing some common technical domains. Bloomberg, a financial data and media giant, has a massive, well-documented question bank reflecting its rigorous, high-volume interview process. Expedia, a leading online travel company, has a smaller, more concentrated set of problems. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The disparity in question volume is the most striking difference.

**Bloomberg** has a catalog of **1,173 questions**, categorized by difficulty as Easy (391), Medium (625), and Hard (157). This vast pool indicates a highly standardized and deep interview process. Candidates can expect a wide variety of problems, with a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty questions that test nuanced application of core data structures and algorithms. The high number of Hard problems suggests that roles, especially senior ones, may involve complex system design or optimization challenges.

**Expedia** has a significantly smaller set of **54 questions**, with a distribution of Easy (13), Medium (35), and Hard (6). This smaller, more curated list suggests their interviews may focus more on a consistent set of fundamental concepts. The emphasis is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty problems, with very few Hard ones. Preparing for Expedia is more about mastering a core set of patterns deeply rather than encountering a huge breadth of novel problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational computer science topics, but with different secondary emphases.

The core overlap is clear: **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are fundamental for both. These topics form the basis for most data manipulation and lookup questions. You will need to be proficient in operations like two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and frequency counting.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Bloomberg** lists **Math**. This often includes problems related to probability, numerical analysis, or bit manipulation, which can be relevant in financial contexts.
- **Expedia** lists **Greedy**. This indicates a focus on problems involving optimization and making locally optimal choices, which are common in scheduling, resource allocation, and routing algorithms—highly relevant to the travel industry.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be dictated by the scope of your goals.

**Prepare for Bloomberg first if:** You are interviewing there specifically, or if you are building a broad, deep foundation for the entire FAANG/Big Tech interview circuit. The enormous question bank covers a wide array of patterns and difficulties. Mastering a significant portion of Bloomberg's Medium problems will inherently prepare you for the core of Expedia's list and most other companies. It is the more comprehensive, and thus more time-intensive, path.

**Prepare for Expedia first if:** You have an upcoming interview with them or similar mid-tier tech companies, and time is limited. You can efficiently target their core list. Focus intensely on mastering all Array, String, Hash Table, and Greedy problems at the Easy and Medium level. This focused practice will yield high returns for the interview. However, this targeted approach may leave gaps for the broader challenges expected at a firm like Bloomberg.

In essence, Bloomberg preparation is a marathon that builds universal strength, while Expedia preparation is a targeted sprint. For many candidates, starting with the depth of Bloomberg's patterns and then reviewing Expedia's specific Greedy focus is a robust hybrid approach.
