Queue questions appear in 40+ common coding problems, with a notable 40% classified as Hard. This distribution signals that interviewers use queues not just to test basic data structure knowledge, but to evaluate your ability to manage state, order, and sliding windows in complex scenarios. Mastering queue patterns is essential for system design questions involving rate limiting, task scheduling, and BFS traversals in graphs and trees.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing these core patterns will let you map problems to solutions quickly.

**1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
The quintessential queue application. BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level-by-level in trees or graphs, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node.val)  # Process node
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
```

```javascript
function bfs(root) {
  if (!root) return;
  const queue = [root];
  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    console.log(node.val); // Process node
    if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
    if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public void bfs(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode node = queue.poll();
        System.out.println(node.val); // Process node
        if (node.left != null) queue.add(node.left);
        if (node.right != null) queue.add(node.right);
    }
}
```

</div>

**2. Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum**
Use a monotonic deque (double-ended queue) to maintain candidate elements within a sliding window. The front of the deque always holds the optimal value (max or min) for the current window.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    result = []
    dq = deque()  # stores indices
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Remove indices outside the window
        if dq and dq[0] <= i - k:
            dq.popleft()
        # Maintain decreasing order for max
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < num:
            dq.pop()
        dq.append(i)
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])
    return result
```

```javascript
function maxSlidingWindow(nums, k) {
  const result = [];
  const dq = []; // stores indices
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Remove indices outside the window
    if (dq.length && dq[0] <= i - k) dq.shift();
    // Maintain decreasing order for max
    while (dq.length && nums[dq[dq.length - 1]] < nums[i]) dq.pop();
    dq.push(i);
    if (i >= k - 1) result.push(nums[dq[0]]);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return new int[0];
    int[] result = new int[nums.length - k + 1];
    Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>(); // stores indices
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Remove indices outside the window
        if (!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekFirst() <= i - k) dq.pollFirst();
        // Maintain decreasing order for max
        while (!dq.isEmpty() && nums[dq.peekLast()] < nums[i]) dq.pollLast();
        dq.offerLast(i);
        if (i >= k - 1) result[i - k + 1] = nums[dq.peekFirst()];
    }
    return result;
}
```

</div>

**3. Circular Queue / Bounded Buffer**
Implement a queue with a fixed capacity using a circular array. This pattern is fundamental for producer-consumer problems and system design.

**4. Two-Queue or Deque for Special FIFO/LIFO Hybrids**
Some problems require maintaining state with two queues (e.g., implementing a stack with queues) or using a deque to process elements from both ends.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The 40-question dataset splits as: 6 Easy (15%), 18 Medium (45%), 16 Hard (40%). This is a telling distribution.

- **Easy (15%):** These test basic operations—enqueue, dequeue, and simple BFS on trees. They verify you know the fundamentals.
- **Medium (45%):** The core battleground. Here, the queue is a component in a more complex algorithm, like BFS on a graph, a monotonic deque for a sliding window, or simulation problems (e.g., time-based tasks).
- **Hard (40%):** The high proportion of Hard questions indicates queues are a tool for advanced problem-solving. Expect complex graph traversals with multiple constraints, intricate sliding window variations, or system design implementations (like a rate limiter). Success here requires combining the queue pattern with other techniques like heaps or hash maps.

## Which Companies Ask Queue Questions

Queue problems are staples at companies where system efficiency and data streaming are critical.

- [Google](/company/google): Frequently asks BFS for shortest path and complex sliding window problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) & [Microsoft](/company/microsoft): Common in design questions (task schedulers, message queues) and tree/graph traversals.
- [Meta](/company/meta): Leans heavily on BFS for level-order traversal and graph connection problems.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg): Often features real-time data stream problems requiring queues or deques.

## Study Tips

1.  **Implement a Queue from Scratch:** Know how to build a queue using a linked list and a circular array. Understand the trade-offs.
2.  **Practice BFS Variations:** Don't just memorize tree BFS. Practice on 2D grids (number of islands), finding shortest paths in graphs, and multi-source BFS.
3.  **Master the Monotonic Deque:** This is the key to solving "Sliding Window Maximum" and its variants efficiently. Practice until you can derive the logic for both increasing and decreasing deques.
4.  **Simulate Process Flows:** For problems involving task scheduling or time-based events, manually simulate the process with a queue. Write down the state of the queue at each step before coding.

Focus your practice on Medium and Hard problems to cover the 85% of questions that truly test your understanding.
