Target’s technical interview process for software engineering roles typically involves one or two coding rounds focused on problem-solving and data structures. The questions are designed to assess your ability to write clean, efficient code and communicate your thought process clearly. While not known for extreme algorithmic difficulty, success requires consistent, targeted practice on their favored topics.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, Target’s coding question distribution is approximately:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (25%)
- **Medium:** 5 questions (63%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (13%)

This breakdown is crucial for your strategy. The overwhelming majority of your interview will be spent on Medium-difficulty problems. This means you must be highly proficient in applying core data structures to common scenarios—think manipulating arrays and strings, traversing trees, and implementing standard algorithms like sorting and DFS. The single Hard question is your differentiator; it often involves a complex twist on a fundamental pattern. Don't neglect fundamentals by chasing obscure algorithms. Mastery of Medium problems is the key to passing; comfort with Hard problems is the key to excelling.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequently tested topics are Array, String, Sorting, Tree, and Depth-First Search. Here’s how to prioritize them.

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock. Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and hash maps for tracking characters or counts. The ability to traverse and transform these linear structures efficiently is non-negotiable.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for other algorithms. Know how to use built-in sorts effectively and understand when a custom comparator is needed. Problems may involve merging intervals or finding minimum/maximum values after sorting.
- **Tree:** Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order) are essential. You must be able to implement these both recursively and iteratively.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** This is the most critical _algorithmic pattern_ for Target. It’s applied not only to trees but also to graph problems (like matrix traversal) and backtracking scenarios (generating combinations). Mastering recursive DFS is paramount.

The most important pattern to internalize is **Depth-First Search on a Binary Tree**. It's the cornerstone for many Tree and DFS problems.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def inorder_dfs(root):
    """Performs an in-order DFS traversal (Left, Root, Right)."""
    result = []
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return
        dfs(node.left)    # Recurse left
        result.append(node.val) # Process current node
        dfs(node.right)   # Recurse right
    dfs(root)
    return result
```

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function inorderDFS(root) {
  /** Performs an in-order DFS traversal (Left, Root, Right). */
  const result = [];
  function dfs(node) {
    if (!node) return;
    dfs(node.left); // Recurse left
    result.push(node.val); // Process current node
    dfs(node.right); // Recurse right
  }
  dfs(root);
  return result;
}
```

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> inorderDFS(TreeNode root) {
        /** Performs an in-order DFS traversal (Left, Root, Right). */
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(root, result);
        return result;
    }
    private void dfs(TreeNode node, List<Integer> list) {
        if (node == null) return;
        dfs(node.left, list);   // Recurse left
        list.add(node.val);     // Process current node
        dfs(node.right, list);  // Recurse right
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than months of unstructured study.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building**

- **Goal:** Achieve fluency in Easy and core Medium problems.
- **Action:** Dedicate each day to one of the five core topics. Solve 2-3 problems per topic, focusing on the essential patterns (two-pointers for arrays, DFS for trees, etc.). Use your preferred language’s standard library until operations like sorting and hash map insertion are automatic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery**

- **Goal:** Solve any Medium problem from Target's common topics within 25 minutes.
- **Action:** Start practicing mixed problem sets. Focus on problems that combine topics, like "Sort an array and then use two-pointers" or "DFS on a matrix (2D array)." Begin timing your sessions. For each problem, articulate your approach aloud before coding, mimicking the interview.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Hard Problem Exposure**

- **Goal:** Polish communication and tackle the Hard problem edge case.
- **Action:** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the full interview: clarify requirements, discuss approach, code, and test. Dedicate time to analyzing 2-3 Hard problems. Don't aim to solve many; aim to deeply understand the solution pattern and how it extends from Medium concepts.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** Always restate the problem in your own words and walk through 1-2 small examples. Outline your algorithm in plain English or pseudocode before writing a single line of code. This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Optimize Deliberately.** Start with a brute-force solution if the optimal one isn't immediate. Acknowledge its inefficiency (O(n²) time, etc.), then iterate toward the better solution. This is often better than silent struggle.
3.  **Test with Your Example.** After coding, don't just say "looks good." Run through the example you defined at the start. Then, test edge cases: empty input, single element, sorted/reversed arrays. Verbally state what you're checking for.
4.  **Know Your Language's Collections API.** Be able to instantiate and use lists, hash maps, sets, and priority queues (heaps) without hesitation. Time spent looking up syntax is time not spent solving the problem.

Success in Target's coding interviews is a function of disciplined practice on the right material. Focus on the core topics, master the Medium difficulty, and you'll be well-prepared.
