Veeva Systems interviews for software engineering roles focus on practical problem-solving with a strong emphasis on data structures and algorithms. The process typically involves one or two technical phone screens, followed by a virtual onsite consisting of 3-4 rounds. These rounds often include a mix of coding, system design, and behavioral discussions. The coding portion is the core, and understanding its specific profile is the first step to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, Veeva's coding questions are almost exclusively at the **Medium** difficulty level. This is a critical insight. It means you are unlikely to face obscure, brain-teasing "Hard" problems or trivial "Easy" ones. The interview is designed to assess your foundational competency in applying core algorithms to non-trivial, real-world adjacent problems.

The 100% Medium focus signals that interviewers are evaluating:

- **Reliable Implementation:** Can you correctly and efficiently translate a known pattern into bug-free code under pressure?
- **Problem Decomposition:** Can you break down a moderately complex requirement into solvable steps using standard data structures?
- **Communication:** Can you explain your thought process clearly as you work through a solution that has some nuance?

Your preparation should therefore prioritize depth and fluency in Medium-tier problems over grinding a huge volume of esoteric Hard questions.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a cohesive toolkit for handling common data processing tasks. Mastering their intersection is key.

- **Array & String:** The fundamental data types for most problems. Expect to manipulate indices, slices, and characters.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups, used for counting, mapping, and deduplication. It's often combined with other topics.
- **Sorting:** A crucial preprocessing step that can simplify many problems, especially when paired with the two-pointer technique.
- **Sliding Window:** The premier pattern for optimizing problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings to meet a certain condition.

The most powerful combination for Veeva is likely **Hash Table + Sliding Window** for substring or subarray problems. Here is a classic example: finding the longest substring with at most K distinct characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Expand window: add char at 'right'
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # Shrink window if we exceed k distinct chars
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # Update answer
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // Expand window
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    // Shrink window if needed
    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    // Update answer
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // Expand window
        char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(rightChar, charCount.getOrDefault(rightChar, 0) + 1);

        // Shrink window if needed
        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Update answer
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition**

- Dedicate this phase to the core topics: Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting, and Sliding Window.
- Solve 15-20 curated Medium problems for each topic. Don't just solve—memorize the pattern. For each problem, articulate _why_ a hash table or sliding window is the optimal approach.
- Practice writing the boilerplate for a sliding window and a two-pointer solution from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Mock Interviews**

- Focus on problems that combine 2-3 of the key topics (e.g., "Sort Array then use Two-Pointer" or "Sliding Window with a Hash Map counter").
- Start doing timed practice sessions (45-60 minutes per problem) to simulate the real interview pace.
- Begin mock interviews. Explain your thought process out loud from the moment you read the problem. This is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 5-6: Refinement & Company-Specific Practice**

- In the final stretch, target your effort. Use the TidyBit company tag to practice problems frequently asked at Veeva.
- Re-solve your earlier mistakes. Fluency is more important than seeing new problems.
- Conduct 2-3 full mock interview loops (2-3 back-to-back coding sessions) to build stamina.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Before writing a single line of code, restate the problem in your own words, confirm edge cases, and outline your algorithm step-by-step. Interviewers want to follow your logic.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** With Medium problems, a clean, correct solution that uses a well-known pattern is better than a buggy, "optimal" one. Get a working solution first, then discuss optimizations.
3.  **Test with Examples Immediately:** After writing your code, don't just declare it done. Walk through the provided example and a small edge case (empty input, minimal K value, etc.) using your code as a checklist. This catches off-by-one errors.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** For a problem like "find anagrams in a string," immediately ask: "What is the character set? Is the search case-sensitive? How should we output the results?" This shows systematic thinking.

Veeva's interview is a test of applied fundamentals. By drilling the specific combination of Medium-difficulty problems focused on Strings, Arrays, Hash Tables, and the Sliding Window pattern, you build the precise muscle memory needed to perform reliably under interview conditions.
