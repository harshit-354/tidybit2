Cracking Coupang's coding interviews requires a targeted approach. Known as "Korea's Amazon," Coupang's engineering bar is high, with a process typically involving multiple rounds of technical screening focused on algorithmic problem-solving, system design, and behavioral questions. Your success hinges on efficiently solving medium to hard problems under pressure. Let's break down how to prepare.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 53 Coupang coding questions reveals a clear, challenging profile:

- **Easy:** 3 questions (6%)
- **Medium:** 36 questions (68%)
- **Hard:** 14 questions (26%)

This distribution is telling. With nearly 70% of questions at a Medium level, **mastery of core data structures and common algorithms is the absolute baseline.** You must solve these problems flawlessly and efficiently. The significant 26% Hard portion means you cannot rely on rote memorization; you must be prepared for complex problems that combine multiple concepts or require non-trivial optimizations. Expect questions that start as a standard Medium but have additional constraints pushing them into Hard territory.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these high-frequency topics, which account for the majority of Coupang's problems.

- **Array & String:** The foundation. Expect manipulations, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for frequency counting and complement searches in array problems.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Critical for optimization problems. Focus on top-down (memoization) and bottom-up tabulation for classic patterns like knapsack, LCS, and subsequences.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Key for problems involving ordering, merging sorted data, or finding top/bottom K elements.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is paramount for Array/String problems, especially when dealing with subarrays or substrings with specific conditions. Here’s a template for finding the longest substring without repeating characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char seen, move left pointer past its last occurrence
        if char in char_index:
            left = max(left, char_index[char] + 1)
        # Update char's latest index
        char_index[char] = right
        # Update max length
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    // If char seen, move left pointer past its last occurrence
    if (charIndex.has(char)) {
      left = Math.max(left, charIndex.get(char) + 1);
    }
    // Update char's latest index
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    // Update max length
    max_len = Math.max(max_len, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        // If char seen, move left pointer past its last occurrence
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c)) {
            left = Math.max(left, charIndex.get(c) + 1);
        }
        // Update char's latest index
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        // Update max length
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Drill the top topics: Array, String, Hash Table. Solve 15-20 Medium problems for each.
- Learn patterns: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum. Implement each pattern from scratch multiple times.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Topics & Integration**

- Tackle Dynamic Programming. Start with 1D (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs) and move to 2D (Knapsack, LCS). Solve 15+ DP problems.
- Master Heap (Priority Queue) for problems like Merge K Sorted Lists, Top K Frequent Elements.
- Begin integrating topics—many Hard problems are DP on arrays or heaps with hash tables.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gaps**

- Simulate real interviews. Use platforms to get timed, unstructured problems. Practice vocalizing your thought process.
- Target your weak spots. If graph problems appear, dedicate time to BFS/DFS. Re-solve previously challenging problems.
- In the final days, review key pattern templates and problem archetypes, not new content.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize From the Start:** For Medium problems, Coupang expects optimal time _and_ space complexity. Always state the brute force, then immediately optimize. Mention trade-offs.
2.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** Think out loud. Explain your reasoning before writing code. Ask clarifying questions about input ranges and edge cases. This is as important as your solution.
3.  **Practice Under Real Constraints:** Use a basic text editor without auto-complete for some practice sessions. Time yourself strictly (30-40 minutes per problem).
4.  **Don't Ignore the "Easy" Fundamentals:** The few Easy questions are likely screening filters. A clumsy fizz-buzz or basic binary search failure can end your process early. Be flawless on the basics.
5.  **Plan for the Hard 26%:** When you encounter a Hard problem, break it down. Solve a simplified version first, then add complexity. Even a partial, well-reasoned solution is better than no solution.

Coupang's interview tests for strong fundamentals, applied problem-solving, and clear communication under pressure. Target the high-frequency topics, master the patterns, and simulate the real environment.
