When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice. Zoho and Yahoo, while both established tech companies, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. A strategic candidate analyzes these differences to allocate study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Zoho's repository is significantly larger, with **179 questions** compared to Yahoo's **64 questions**. This suggests Zoho's interview process may draw from a broader set of problems or that its question bank has been accumulated over a longer period.

The difficulty distribution reveals further contrast:

- **Zoho (E62/M97/H20):** The profile is weighted towards medium difficulty, with nearly 100 medium-level questions. The presence of 20 hard questions indicates that interviews can delve into complex algorithmic challenges.
- **Yahoo (E26/M32/H6):** The distribution is more balanced relative to its total, but heavily skewed towards easy and medium problems. With only 6 hard questions, the overall difficulty ceiling appears lower than Zoho's.

This data implies that for Zoho, mastering medium problems is the critical foundation, but you must be prepared for a tough final round. For Yahoo, confidence across easy and medium problems is likely sufficient for most roles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, with **Array, String, and Hash Table** appearing as top topics for each. This is standard for software engineering interviews, testing fundamental manipulation and lookup skills.

**Zoho's** listed topics include **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, which aligns with its larger number of hard questions. DP problems are classic medium-to-hard challenges that require pattern recognition and optimal substructure thinking.

**Yahoo's** listed topics include **Sorting**, highlighting an emphasis on fundamental algorithms and efficiency. While sorting is implicit in many problems, its explicit mention suggests you should be ready to discuss and implement sorts, analyze their trade-offs, and use them as a problem-solving step.

The core overlap means preparing for one company builds a foundation for the other. However, the unique topics signal where to deepen your focus.

```python
# Example: A problem combining Hash Table and Sorting (Yahoo focus)
def find_original_array(changed):
    """
    Given an array `changed` that is supposedly a doubled array,
    return the original array if possible, else an empty array.
    """
    if len(changed) % 2 != 0:
        return []

    freq = {}
    for num in changed:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

    original = []
    for num in sorted(changed):
        if freq.get(num, 0) > 0 and freq.get(num * 2, 0) > 0:
            if num == 0 and freq[num] < 2: # Special case for zero
                continue
            original.append(num)
            freq[num] -= 1
            freq[num * 2] -= 1
    return original if len(original) == len(changed) // 2 else []
```

```javascript
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table and Sorting (Yahoo focus)
function findOriginalArray(changed) {
  if (changed.length % 2 !== 0) return [];

  const freq = new Map();
  for (const num of changed) {
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }

  const original = [];
  changed.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (const num of changed) {
    if (freq.get(num) > 0 && freq.get(num * 2) > 0) {
      if (num === 0 && freq.get(num) < 2) continue;
      original.push(num);
      freq.set(num, freq.get(num) - 1);
      freq.set(num * 2, freq.get(num * 2) - 1);
    }
  }
  return original.length === changed.length / 2 ? original : [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table and Sorting (Yahoo focus)
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findOriginalArray(int[] changed) {
        if (changed.length % 2 != 0) return new int[0];

        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int num : changed) {
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : freq.keySet()) {
            while (freq.get(num) > 0) {
                int doubleVal = num * 2;
                if (!freq.containsKey(doubleVal) || freq.get(doubleVal) <= 0) {
                    return new int[0];
                }
                if (num == 0 && freq.get(num) < 2) {
                    return new int[0];
                }
                originalList.add(num);
                freq.put(num, freq.get(num) - 1);
                freq.put(doubleVal, freq.get(doubleVal) - 1);
            }
        }

        int[] original = new int[originalList.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
            original[i] = originalList.get(i);
        }
        return original;
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Yahoo**. Its smaller, less difficult question set allows you to efficiently build core competency in the shared topics (Array, String, Hash Table). Mastering these 64 questions, especially the sorting-related problems, creates a strong baseline.

Then, move to **Zoho**. Use the foundation from Yahoo to tackle Zoho's extensive medium-difficulty problems. This is where the bulk of your Zoho preparation will occur. Finally, dedicate specific study time to **Dynamic Programming** patterns and Zoho's hard questions to clear the highest bar their interviews might set.

This progression—from the focused, foundational set to the broader, more challenging one—ensures your study time compounds effectively.
