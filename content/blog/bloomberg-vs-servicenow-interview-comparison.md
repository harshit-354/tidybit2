When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Bloomberg and ServiceNow, while both respected in the tech industry, present distinctly different interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty, and emphasis. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most striking difference. Bloomberg's tagged question bank on TidyBit is extensive, with **1,173 questions** categorized by difficulty (391 Easy, 625 Medium, 157 Hard). This massive repository reflects Bloomberg's long-standing, algorithm-intensive interview process, which is known for its breadth and depth. You should expect a strong emphasis on problem-solving fundamentals across a wide range of scenarios.

In contrast, ServiceNow's tagged question bank is significantly smaller, with **78 questions** (8 Easy, 58 Medium, 12 Hard). The distribution here is telling: the vast majority are Medium difficulty. This suggests that while ServiceNow's technical screen may be less about encountering a vast array of obscure problems, it demands consistent, proficient problem-solving on standard algorithmic challenges. The lower volume does not necessarily mean it's easier; it means the focus is narrower and more predictable.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core computer science fundamentals. The top overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Bloomberg lists **Math** as a top category, which can include number theory, probability, or bit manipulation problems. ServiceNow lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top category. This indicates a clear emphasis: ServiceNow interviews are more likely to include at least one problem requiring a DP approach (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, or pathfinding problems), whereas Bloomberg's problems, while potentially covering DP, show a broader interest in mathematical reasoning.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the nature of the challenge.

**Prepare for ServiceNow first if:** Your interview is sooner or you want to build confidence with a more focused question set. The smaller, Medium-heavy bank is manageable. Deeply practice Array, String, Hash Table, and **especially Dynamic Programming**. Solving all 78 tagged questions is a feasible and highly effective goal. This focused practice on core patterns will build a strong foundation.

**Prepare for Bloomberg first if:** You have more time or are aiming for a role that demands extensive algorithmic agility. Tackling Bloomberg's vast question bank is a marathon. Start with the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and Math, prioritizing Medium-difficulty questions. This process will inherently cover the patterns needed for ServiceNow and most other companies. Use Bloomberg prep as a comprehensive training ground; if you can handle its breadth, the focused set from ServiceNow will feel like a subset.

In essence, ServiceNow preparation is a targeted deep dive, while Bloomberg preparation is a broad foundational grind. Mastering the core overlapping topics will serve you well for both.
