Nuro’s coding interviews are designed to assess your ability to solve practical, often spatially-aware problems, reflecting their core work in autonomous delivery. The process typically involves 1-2 rounds of algorithmic coding, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-tested solutions under time constraints. Understanding the specific patterns they favor is the fastest path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 17 Nuro coding questions reveals a clear emphasis on applied problem-solving:

- **Medium: 13 questions (76%)**
- **Hard: 3 questions (18%)**
- **Easy: 1 question (6%)**

This distribution is telling. The near absence of Easy questions means you won't be warmed up with trivial tasks. The interview starts at a working engineer's level. The high concentration of Medium problems indicates they are the core of the interview—these questions test foundational data structures and algorithms applied to non-trivial scenarios, often involving 2D space or state transitions. The significant presence of Hard problems (nearly 1 in 5) means you must be prepared for complexity, typically involving optimization or combining multiple techniques. Your preparation must be geared towards solving Medium problems reliably and efficiently, with the stamina to tackle a Hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics directly mirror challenges in robotics and mapping: manipulating sensor data (Arrays), parsing commands (Strings), organizing information (Sorting), navigating grids (Matrix), and exploring states or paths (Breadth-First Search).

- **Array & String:** The bedrock. Expect operations on data streams, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just `sort()`. It's about using sorting as a pre-processing step to enable greedy or efficient search strategies.
- **Matrix:** Central to grid-based navigation. Master traversal, island problems, and shortest path in a 2D grid.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The single most critical algorithm for Nuro. It's the go-to for finding the shortest path in unweighted grids, level-order traversal, and exploring all possible states (e.g., robot positions).

Given BFS's importance for grid navigation—a core autonomous vehicle problem—this pattern is non-negotiable. Here is the standard implementation for shortest path in a binary matrix, where `0` is a traversable cell and `1` is an obstacle.

```python
from collections import deque

def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid):
    if not grid or grid[0][0] == 1:
        return -1

    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)]

    queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])  # (row, col, distance)
    grid[0][0] = 1  # Mark visited

    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        if r == n-1 and c == n-1:
            return dist

        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
                grid[nr][nc] = 1  # Mark visited
    return -1
```

```javascript
function shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid) {
  if (!grid || grid[0][0] === 1) return -1;

  const n = grid.length;
  const directions = [
    [-1, -1],
    [-1, 0],
    [-1, 1],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
    [1, -1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1],
  ];

  const queue = [[0, 0, 1]]; // [row, col, distance]
  grid[0][0] = 1;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [r, c, dist] = queue.shift();
    if (r === n - 1 && c === n - 1) return dist;

    for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
      const nr = r + dr,
        nc = c + dc;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < n && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] === 0) {
        queue.push([nr, nc, dist + 1]);
        grid[nr][nc] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid[0][0] == 1) return -1;

        int n = grid.length;
        int[][] directions = {{-1,-1},{-1,0},{-1,1},{0,-1},{0,1},{1,-1},{1,0},{1,1}};

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, 1}); // {row, col, distance}
        grid[0][0] = 1;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1], dist = cell[2];
            if (r == n-1 && c == n-1) return dist;

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < n && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc, dist + 1});
                    grid[nr][nc] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Week 1-2: **Foundation.** Grind the core topics. Solve 15-20 problems on Arrays/Strings (focus on two-pointer and sliding window), 10-15 on Matrix (traversal, BFS/DFS), and 15-20 on Graph/BFS. Ensure you can write BFS in your sleep.

Week 3-4: **Integration.** Move to Medium and Hard problems that combine topics. Examples: sorting an array to enable a two-pointer search, or using BFS on a matrix with state (like having keys to doors). Practice explaining your thought process aloud.

Week 5: **Mock Interviews & Nuro-Specific Prep.** Do timed mock interviews focusing on 45-minute sessions with one Medium-Hard problem. Actively seek out problems involving grids, shortest paths, and simulation.

Week 6: **Final Review & System Design.** Revisit your problem notes and weak spots. Dedicate time to system design fundamentals, as Nuro often includes a round on scalable, real-time systems for autonomy.

## Key Tips

1.  **BFS is Your Default for Grid Pathfinding.** When the problem involves "shortest path" in a grid, maze, or level-order state exploration, BFS should be your immediate first thought. Practice its variations (multi-source, with constraints).
2.  **Clarify Edge Cases for Spatial Problems.** For any matrix or array problem, explicitly ask about input validation: empty grid, single cell, all obstacles, start/end blocked. Stating these shows production-level thinking.
3.  **Optimize After a Working Solution.** Don't get stuck seeking the optimal solution immediately. Articulate a brute-force or naive approach, then refine it. Interviewers want to see your problem-solving journey.
4.  **Test with a Small Example.** Before coding, walk through a 2x2 or 3x3 example. This catches logical errors in your traversal logic or state management before you write a line of code.
5.  **Discuss Time/Space Complexity Clearly.** For each solution, explicitly state the Big O. For BFS on an _n x n_ grid, it's O(n^2) for time and space in the worst case.

Master these patterns, and you'll be equipped to navigate Nuro's technical challenges. For targeted practice, [Browse all Nuro questions on TidyBit](/company/nuro).
