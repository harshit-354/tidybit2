Dynamic Programming (DP) is a core algorithmic technique for solving complex optimization and combinatorial problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems. At Salesforce, with 38 DP questions in its coding interview repertoire, mastery of this concept is non-negotiable. The company's products handle massive datasets, complex business logic, and real-time optimizations—scenarios where brute-force solutions are computationally impossible. DP provides the framework for efficient, scalable algorithms, making it a direct indicator of a candidate's ability to design systems that are both correct and performant under constraints.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Salesforce's DP problems typically fall into two categories, reflecting real-world engineering challenges.

1.  **Classic Sequence & String Problems:** These are foundational. Expect variations on longest common subsequence, edit distance, palindromic substrings, and ways to decode messages. They test your ability to model relationships between sequences, a common task in data processing and integration pipelines.
2.  **Knapsack & Partition Problems:** These deal with resource allocation and optimization. You might encounter problems like "Target Sum," "Partition Equal Subset Sum," or coin change variants. These directly mirror backend challenges at Salesforce: optimizing server resource allocation, feature flag rollouts, or balancing loads across services.

The problems are rarely presented in their textbook form. The key is to recognize the underlying pattern—often, a problem about assigning tasks or dividing arrays is a partition problem in disguise.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by internalizing the core DP patterns: 1) Define the state `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]`, 2) Establish the recurrence relation, and 3) Determine the base case and traversal order. Drill these patterns until you can derive them from the problem statement.

A fundamental pattern is the **"House Robber"** problem, which teaches state definition for sequential decision-making. The recurrence relation is: `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`. This pattern appears in problems where you make decisions that affect adjacent elements.

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])

    return dp[-1]
```

```javascript
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

  let dp = new Array(nums.length);
  dp[0] = nums[0];
  dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

  for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
  }

  return dp[nums.length - 1];
}
```

```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

    for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i]);
    }

    return dp[nums.length - 1];
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Do not attempt random DP problems. Follow a structured progression:

1.  **Foundation:** Solve "Climbing Stairs" and "Fibonacci" to understand state and recurrence.
2.  **1D DP:** Master "House Robber," "Coin Change," and "Longest Increasing Subsequence." This builds intuition for single-array state.
3.  **2D DP:** Tackle "Longest Common Subsequence," "Edit Distance," and "0/1 Knapsack." This is critical for Salesforce's string and optimization problems.
4.  **Salesforce-Specific:** Finally, practice the 38 tagged problems on TidyBit. Focus on identifying which classic pattern each problem maps to.
