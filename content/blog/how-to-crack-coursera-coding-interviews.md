Coursera’s technical interview process is designed to assess strong foundational computer science knowledge and clean, efficient coding. While the exact format can vary by team, candidates can typically expect a mix of algorithmic problem-solving on platforms like HackerRank or CodeSignal, followed by live coding sessions focused on data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. The problems are known for their academic rigor, reflecting the company's educational mission.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Coursera-style questions reveals a clear and challenging distribution: 11% Easy, 44% Medium, and 44% Hard. This skew toward Medium and Hard problems is significant. It tells you that simply solving introductory problems isn't enough. Coursera interviews test your ability to navigate complex problem statements, optimize solutions, and handle edge cases under pressure. The 44% Hard rate, in particular, indicates you must be comfortable with advanced patterns and multi-step reasoning. Expect problems that combine concepts, like a dynamic programming solution that also requires clever mathematical insight.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows five dominant areas. Master these to cover the vast majority of question types.

- **Math:** Many problems have a mathematical core, requiring number theory, combinatorics, or modular arithmetic. Recognize patterns to avoid brute force.
- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Mastery here is non-negotiable, especially techniques for in-place operations and subarray problems.
- **String:** Closely tied to array techniques. Focus on palindrome checks, anagrams, sliding windows for substrings, and string builders for efficiency.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just about calling `sort()`. Understand _when_ to sort to enable a two-pointer or greedy solution, and know the time/space trade-offs of different algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Critical given its prevalence in Hard problems. You must identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and be fluent in both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.

For a top topic like **Dynamic Programming**, the most important pattern is the **0/1 Knapsack** framework. It's the foundation for many problems involving making optimal selections with constraints. Here is the bottom-up tabulation approach:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    # DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take the item
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip the item
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                # Cannot take the item
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  // DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        // Option 1: Take the item
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        // Option 2: Skip the item
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        // Cannot take the item
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.length;
    // DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                // Option 1: Take the item
                int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                // Option 2: Skip the item
                int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
            } else {
                // Cannot take the item
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 6-Week Study Plan

A structured approach is essential to cover the breadth and depth required.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this time to Arrays, Strings, and Sorting. Solve 30-40 problems, focusing on Medium difficulty. Implement all major sorting algorithms yourself. Practice two-pointer and sliding window techniques until they are automatic.
- **Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns.** Tackle Dynamic Programming and Math-intensive problems. Start with classical DP problems (Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS) before moving to harder variants. For Math, practice prime numbers, GCD/LCM, and combinatorial calculations.
- **Week 5: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Solve problems that combine topics (e.g., a Math problem that uses an Array). Begin taking timed mock interviews that include at least one Hard problem. Focus on explaining your thought process clearly.
- **Week 6: Refinement & Review.** Revisit your problem notes and weak areas. Practice a few new Hard problems under strict time constraints. Systematically review time/space complexity analysis for all patterns you've learned.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, complexity, and edge cases. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving reasoning as much as the final code.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** Often a brute-force solution is a good starting point. State it, then explicitly discuss how you will optimize it (e.g., "We can improve this from O(n²) to O(n log n) by using a hash map and sorting").
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Always run through small examples, empty inputs, large values, and negative numbers. This demonstrates thoroughness and can catch logical errors before the interviewer does.
4.  **Write Clean, Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and helper functions when logic becomes complex. Comment briefly on non-obvious steps.

Success in a Coursera interview hinges on deep understanding, not just recognition. Practice the patterns until you can derive them, not just recall them.
