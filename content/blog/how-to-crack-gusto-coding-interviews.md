Gusto’s coding interviews are a direct assessment of your problem-solving and engineering fundamentals. The process typically involves 1-2 technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via a collaborative coding platform. The questions are designed to evaluate not just whether you get the correct answer, but how you think through a problem, communicate your approach, and write clean, efficient code. Success hinges on targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, Gusto’s question distribution is a classic bell curve: 20% Easy, 60% Medium, and 20% Hard. This breakdown is crucial for your strategy.

The 60% majority being Medium questions is your primary battleground. These problems test core computer science concepts applied in slightly novel ways. They require a solid grasp of data structures and the ability to implement a working solution under moderate time constraints. The single Hard question (20%) is often a test of depth—can you handle complexity, optimize an initial approach, or combine multiple concepts? The single Easy question (20%) is a warm-up, but failing it is a critical red flag; it tests basic coding competency and attention to detail. Your goal is to master Mediums and be prepared to thoughtfully tackle a Hard.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a clear study roadmap: **Math, String, Recursion, Hash Table, and Binary Search**.

- **Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation. Key patterns include using the modulo operator for cycles and leveraging mathematical formulas (e.g., sum of series) to avoid brute force.
- **String:** Central to many business logic problems. The most critical pattern is the **Sliding Window** for finding substrings or characters satisfying specific conditions, as it optimizes over a naive O(n²) approach.
- **Recursion:** Frequently appears in tree/graph traversal (DFS) and problems with a self-similar structure (e.g., backtracking, divide and conquer). Understanding the recursion stack and base cases is non-negotiable.
- **Hash Table:** The workhorse for achieving O(1) lookups. The essential pattern is using a hash map (dictionary) to **store precomputed information** (like indices or counts) to solve the problem in a single pass, often turning O(n²) into O(n).
- **Binary Search:** Not just for sorted arrays. The key pattern is **applying binary search on a solution space or a function's range**, useful for optimization problems like "find the minimum maximum" or searching in a rotated array.

The Hash Table pattern for a one-pass solution is arguably the most versatile. Here’s a classic example: finding two numbers in an array that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) -> [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) -> [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example: twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9) -> [0, 1]
```

</div>

This pattern—checking for a needed value in a hash map as you iterate—is fundamental to solving countless problems involving pairs, duplicates, or subarray sums in linear time.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. For each, study the core theory, then solve 5-8 problems focusing on the essential pattern (e.g., Sliding Window for Strings, One-pass Hash Map for Hash Table). Use platforms that allow you to filter by topic and difficulty.
- **Weeks 3-4: Integration and Medium Mastery.** Stop studying by topic. Practice exclusively on Medium-difficulty problems, preferably those tagged with Gusto or similar companies. This phase trains you to identify which data structure or algorithm to apply from a blank slate. Time yourself (45 minutes per problem).
- **Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or mentor, simulating the full interview process (clarifying questions, explaining approach, coding, testing). Use this period to shore up weaknesses identified in weeks 3-4. Revisit Hard problems related to the top topics to build stamina for complexity.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Aloud.** From the moment you read the question, verbalize your thoughts. Restate the problem in your own words, ask clarifying edge cases, discuss potential approaches and their trade-offs before writing code. This turns the interview into a collaboration.
2.  **Prioritize a Working Solution Over a Perfect One.** It is far better to implement a brute-force solution correctly, explain its complexity, and then iterate towards an optimization, than to get stuck trying to code the optimal solution immediately. Interviewers want to see your problem-solving trajectory.
3.  **Test with Small Cases.** After writing your code, don't just announce you're done. Walk through a small, non-trivial example input with your code, including edge cases (empty input, single element, negative numbers). This demonstrates rigorous habits and often catches logical errors.
4.  **Know Gusto's Domain.** While the problems are algorithmic, understanding that Gusto builds payroll, benefits, and HR software provides context. Be prepared for problems that might involve date calculations, string parsing for names/IDs, or recursive operations on hierarchical data (like an org chart).

Mastering these patterns and practicing under interview conditions will build the confidence and skill needed to succeed. For a curated list of problems to practice, [Browse all Gusto questions on TidyBit](/company/gusto).
