When preparing for technical interviews, understanding a company's specific focus areas can dramatically increase your efficiency. Yahoo and Expedia, while both major tech companies, show distinct patterns in their interview question libraries on TidyBit. A targeted analysis of volume, difficulty, and topic prevalence reveals clear strategic differences in their technical assessment styles.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Yahoo's question bank is larger and leans more towards foundational problems. With **64 total questions**, its distribution is heavily weighted towards easier and medium challenges: **26 Easy (E)**, **32 Medium (M)**, and only **6 Hard (H)**. This suggests Yahoo's process may prioritize assessing strong core competency and clean code over solving esoteric, complex algorithms.

Expedia's library is slightly smaller at **54 questions**, but its difficulty curve is notably steeper. It has significantly fewer Easy problems (**13 E**) and a higher concentration of Medium ones (**35 M**), alongside **6 Hard** problems. This indicates that Expedia interviews are likely to push candidates more consistently into problem-solving under moderate to high complexity, testing not just knowledge but application under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the fundamental data structures that form the backbone of software engineering. The top four topics for each are nearly identical:

- **Yahoo:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting
- **Expedia:** Array, String, Hash Table, Greedy

The key difference lies in their fourth priority. Yahoo's emphasis on **Sorting** points to a focus on manipulating and organizing data, often a precursor to efficient searching or merging. Expedia's focus on **Greedy** algorithms indicates a preference for questions involving optimization, making locally optimal choices to reach a global solution, which is common in scheduling, resource allocation, and pathfinding problems.

Consider a common "Two Sum" style problem. While both companies might ask it, Yahoo's follow-up might involve sorting the array first for a two-pointer solution, while Expedia might frame it within a larger greedy selection problem.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Yahoo-style: Using Sorting & Two Pointers
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)  # Sorting emphasis
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_sorted[left] + nums_sorted[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return True
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return False
```

```javascript
// Expedia-style: Greedy Pair Selection (conceptual context)
// Imagine selecting pairs for maximum trips (a greedy choice problem)
function canScheduleTrips(trips, maxTrips) {
  trips.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sorting is a tool, not the focus
  let count = 0;
  let i = 0;
  // Greedy: always try to take the shortest available trip
  while (i < trips.length - 1) {
    if (trips[i] + trips[i + 1] <= maxTrips) {
      count++;
      i += 2; // Greedy pair selection
    } else {
      i++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
// Expedia-style: Greedy context
public boolean canScheduleTrips(int[] trips, int maxTrips) {
    Arrays.sort(trips); // Sorting as a step
    int count = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < trips.length - 1) {
        if (trips[i] + trips[i + 1] <= maxTrips) {
            count++;
            i += 2; // Greedy selection logic is the core
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    return count >= someRequiredThreshold;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and foundational strength.

**Prepare for Yahoo first if:** You are earlier in your interview practice or want to solidify your fundamentals. The higher volume of Easy and Medium problems provides a broader set of exercises to master core patterns involving Arrays, Hash Tables, and String manipulation with Sorting. It's an excellent benchmark for general competency.

**Prepare for Expedia first if:** You are already comfortable with easy-level problems and need to ramp up your medium-difficulty problem-solving stamina. The prevalence of Greedy algorithms also means you should dedicate specific study time to that paradigm, practicing problems related to intervals, scheduling, and making optimal choices with sorted data.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in top topics means core preparation for one benefits the other. Mastering Array, String, and Hash Table problems is non-negotiable for both. The strategic difference is in the fourth pillar: drill Sorting techniques for Yahoo, and practice Greedy strategies for Expedia.
