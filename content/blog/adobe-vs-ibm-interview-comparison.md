When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution can significantly streamline your study process. Adobe and IBM, while both established technology companies, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of question volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their profiles to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions and their difficulty spread reveals the expected interview intensity.

**Adobe** presents a larger and more challenging overall set, with **227 questions** categorized as Easy (68), Medium (129), and Hard (30). The high proportion of Medium questions (nearly 57%) indicates that interviews are likely to test solid algorithmic proficiency and problem-solving under moderate time constraints. The presence of 30 Hard questions suggests candidates for senior or specialized roles should be ready for complex scenarios involving optimization or advanced data structure manipulation.

**IBM** has a comparatively smaller and slightly less difficult profile, with **170 questions**: Easy (52), Medium (102), and Hard (16). While Medium questions still dominate (60%), the total count and the lower number of Hard questions imply a slightly more accessible interview process on average. The focus may lean more towards assessing foundational competency and clear, working solutions rather than highly optimized, edge-case handling for most positions.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize core data structures and fundamental techniques, but with a subtle difference in priority.

The top topics show significant alignment:

- **Array** and **String** problems are foundational for both.
- **Two Pointers** is a critical technique for solving problems involving sequences, such as sorted arrays or linked lists.

The key divergence is in the fourth-most frequent topic:

- **Adobe** lists **Hash Table**. This points to a strong emphasis on problems involving efficient lookups, frequency counting, and mapping relationships (e.g., Two Sum, group anagrams, substring problems).
- **IBM** lists **Sorting**. This suggests a focus on problems where ordering data is a key step, often combined with other techniques like binary search or two pointers (e.g., merging intervals, finding a Kth element).

This means while your core preparation will be similar, you should tailor your final review. For Adobe, drill down on hash map applications. For IBM, ensure you are comfortable with various sorting algorithms and, more importantly, problems where sorting is the crucial preprocessing step.

```python
# Example emphasizing Hash Table (Adobe-relevant)
def find_pair_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example emphasizing Sorting (IBM-relevant)
def find_kth_largest(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    return nums[-k]
```

```javascript
// Example emphasizing Hash Table (Adobe-relevant)
function findPairSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example emphasizing Sorting (IBM-relevant)
function findKthLargest(nums, k) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return nums[nums.length - k];
}
```

```java
// Example emphasizing Hash Table (Adobe-relevant)
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] findPairSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Example emphasizing Sorting (IBM-relevant)
import java.util.Arrays;

public int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    return nums[nums.length - k];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both, **prepare for Adobe first**. Its broader question bank and higher difficulty ceiling will force you to build stronger fundamentals and tackle more complex problems. Mastering the Medium-difficulty problems and hash-table-centric patterns required for Adobe will inherently cover a large portion of IBM's expected scope. The core techniques of arrays, strings, and two pointers are universal.

Once comfortable with the Adobe profile, you can efficiently transition to IBM-specific preparation by:

1.  Reviewing sorting algorithms and their time/space complexities.
2.  Practicing problems where the initial sort operation unlocks a simpler solution.
3.  Running through a set of IBM's cataloged questions to familiarize yourself with their specific phrasing and problem contexts.

This approach ensures you build from a more challenging foundation downward, making the subsequent preparation feel more manageable.
