When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly impact your study strategy. Meta and Expedia represent two distinct points on the tech interview spectrum: one is a massive, product-driven tech giant with a vast question pool, and the other is a large-scale e-commerce company with a more concentrated set of problems. Understanding their differences is key to efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question bank. Meta's list of 1387 questions dwarfs Expedia's 54. This volume reflects Meta's status as a top-tier tech company with intense competition and a highly standardized, LeetCode-centric interview process. The difficulty distribution also differs. Meta's questions are heavily weighted toward Medium (762) and Easy (414) problems, with a smaller but significant number of Hard (211) questions. This suggests that while a strong grasp of fundamentals is essential, candidates must also be prepared to tackle complex algorithmic challenges, especially for higher-level roles.

Expedia's question pool is far more manageable, with only 54 questions total. The difficulty is concentrated at the Medium level (35 questions), with fewer Easy (13) and Hard (6) problems. This indicates that Expedia's technical screen likely emphasizes practical problem-solving over extremely advanced computer science theory. The smaller pool also means it's more feasible to practice a high percentage of the questions Expedia has historically asked.

```python
# Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Meta might extend this concept to "3Sum" (Harder).
# Expedia is more likely to ask the core Two Sum problem.
```

```javascript
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These are foundational data structures for coding interviews, and proficiency here is non-negotiable for either company. This strong overlap means preparing core algorithms for these topics (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, prefix sum for arrays; anagram checks, parsing for strings) will serve you well for both interview loops.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Meta lists **Math** (e.g., number manipulation, combinatorics, probability), which often appears in brain-teaser style problems or those requiring bit manipulation. Expedia lists **Greedy** algorithms. This suggests Expedia's questions may lean more toward optimization problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global solution, such as scheduling, task assignment, or coin change problems. This is a practical focus common in e-commerce and logistics domains.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your interview timeline and the breadth of skills you need to build.

**Prepare for Expedia first if:** You are interviewing with them sooner, or you are early in your interview prep journey. The smaller, more focused question set allows you to build confidence by achieving high coverage. Mastering the core Array, String, Hash Table, and Greedy problems from their list will provide a solid foundation that is also transferable.

**Prepare for Meta first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech companies generally, or you have more time to build depth. Tackling Meta's vast question list will force you to develop rigorous problem-solving skills across a wider range of difficulties and topics. The skills you build will easily encompass the scope required for an Expedia interview. However, you must then filter that knowledge, as Meta's emphasis on Math may be less critical for Expedia, while Expedia's Greedy focus deserves specific review.

A strategic hybrid approach is to use the **common topics (Array, String, Hash Table) as your core study foundation**. Then, layer on Meta's Math problems or Expedia's Greedy problems based on your target company. Ultimately, preparing for Meta is the more comprehensive and demanding path, but preparing for Expedia is a more immediately achievable goal.
