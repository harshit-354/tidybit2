When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns matter more than general algorithm knowledge. Uber and Intuit represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a large, fast-moving platform company with a massive question bank, and the other is a focused financial software company with a more moderate set of problems. Understanding their differences is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is scale. Uber's tagged question pool on platforms like LeetCode is over five times larger than Intuit's (381 vs. 71 questions). This volume reflects Uber's broader engineering scope and higher interview throughput.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The interview is medium-heavy. Most questions you'll encounter will be of Medium difficulty, with a significant number of Hard problems, especially for senior roles. The high volume of Hard questions suggests you must be comfortable with complex problem-solving and optimization.
- **Intuit (E10/M47/H14):** The distribution skews more towards Medium difficulty. While Hard questions exist, the set is more manageable. The focus is more likely on clean, correct, and maintainable solutions under typical constraints, rather than extreme optimization on the most complex algorithms.

This means preparing for Uber requires grinding a larger set of more challenging problems, while Intuit prep can be more about mastering fundamentals and common patterns thoroughly.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures. The top four topics are identical, just in a slightly different order: **Array, Hash Table, String, and Dynamic Programming.**

The key difference lies in the application and depth:

- **Uber's questions** often involve these structures in scenarios related to its business: mapping, routing, scheduling, and handling large-scale user/data interactions. DP and graph problems might model ride-matching or ETA calculations.
- **Intuit's questions** may contextualize problems within financial data—transaction processing, ledger balancing, or tax rule application. Arrays and strings might represent financial records, and DP could be used for optimization or calculation problems.

Despite the overlap, the larger Uber question bank will contain more variety and niche topics within these categories. For Intuit, mastering the core patterns is likely sufficient.

```python
# Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for counting.
# Relevant to both companies for frequency analysis.

def find_duplicate_transactions(transactions):
    """Finds duplicate transaction IDs."""
    freq = {}
    duplicates = []
    for txn_id in transactions:
        freq[txn_id] = freq.get(txn_id, 0) + 1
        if freq[txn_id] == 2:  # First time it becomes a duplicate
            duplicates.append(txn_id)
    return duplicates
```

```javascript
// Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for counting.
// Relevant to both companies for frequency analysis.

function findDuplicateTransactions(transactions) {
  const freq = new Map();
  const duplicates = [];
  for (const txnId of transactions) {
    const count = (freq.get(txnId) || 0) + 1;
    freq.set(txnId, count);
    if (count === 2) {
      // First time it becomes a duplicate
      duplicates.push(txnId);
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for counting.
// Relevant to both companies for frequency analysis.

import java.util.*;

public List<String> findDuplicateTransactions(List<String> transactions) {
    Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    List<String> duplicates = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String txnId : transactions) {
        int count = freq.getOrDefault(txnId, 0) + 1;
        freq.put(txnId, count);
        if (count == 2) { // First time it becomes a duplicate
            duplicates.add(txnId);
        }
    }
    return duplicates;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be **Intuit first, then Uber**.

Mastering the Intuit question set will solidify your grasp of the fundamental topics (Array, Hash Table, String, DP) that are essential for both companies. This foundation is non-negotiable. The smaller, medium-focused Intuit pool is an efficient starting point to build confidence and competency.

Once that foundation is strong, you can scale up to Uber preparation. This involves:

1.  **Tackling more Hard problems** to build stamina for complex optimization.
2.  **Practicing a wider variety of questions** within the same core topics to increase your pattern recognition speed.
3.  **Exploring adjacent topics** (like Graphs/Trees) that appear more frequently in Uber's vast question bank due to its domain.

In essence, Intuit prep builds the core engine; Uber prep adds a turbocharger and tests it on a more demanding track.
