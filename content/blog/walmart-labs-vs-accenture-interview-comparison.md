When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Walmart Labs and Accenture both assess core data structures and algorithms, but their interview landscapes differ significantly in difficulty distribution and topic emphasis. This comparison analyzes their question banks to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is in the difficulty breakdown of their questions.

**Walmart Labs** has a total of 152 questions, with a challenging distribution: 22 Easy, 105 Medium, and 25 Hard. This profile indicates a highly selective process focused on problem-solving depth. The overwhelming majority of questions are Medium or Hard, meaning you must be comfortable with complex problem analysis, optimal solution design, and handling edge cases under pressure.

**Accenture** has a total of 144 questions, with a significantly more accessible distribution: 65 Easy, 68 Medium, and only 11 Hard. This suggests a process that strongly emphasizes foundational competency and the ability to implement reliable solutions. While Medium questions are common, the high volume of Easy questions and minimal Hard ones points to a focus on core concepts and clean code over highly advanced algorithmic optimization.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** operations. These are fundamental building blocks for most coding problems. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key divergence lies in their secondary focus areas:

- **Walmart Labs** places a major emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with their difficulty profile, as DP problems are often categorized as Medium or Hard. Expect questions involving optimization, memoization, and breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.
- **Accenture** shows a stronger focus on **Math** problems. This includes number theory, basic combinatorics, and mathematical reasoning, which often result in elegant, if not always algorithmically intense, solutions.

Here is a typical problem that highlights the difference in approach:

```python
# Accenture-style (Math-focused): Count Primes
def countPrimes(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

```javascript
// Accenture-style (Math-focused): Count Primes
function countPrimes(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return 0;
  const isPrime = new Array(n).fill(true);
  isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (isPrime[i]) {
      for (let j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return isPrime.filter(Boolean).length;
}
```

```java
// Accenture-style (Math-focused): Count Primes
public int countPrimes(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return 0;
    boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n];
    Arrays.fill(isPrime, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    int count = 0;
    for (boolean prime : isPrime) {
        if (prime) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

</div>

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Walmart Labs-style (DP-focused): Coin Change
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Walmart Labs-style (DP-focused): Coin Change
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Walmart Labs-style (DP-focused): Coin Change
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Accenture first** if you are early in your interview preparation journey. Its emphasis on Easy and Medium problems across foundational topics provides a solid platform to build core skills in array/string manipulation and hashing. Success here will validate your understanding of the basics.

Shift your focus to **Walmart Labs** once your fundamentals are strong and you need to tackle more advanced challenges. The deep dive into Dynamic Programming and the high density of Medium/Hard problems requires dedicated, advanced practice. Use your solidified base from Accenture-style problems as the springboard into this more difficult material.

In short, Accenture's pattern is an excellent benchmark for foundational readiness, while Walmart Labs' pattern represents a target for high-level, competitive performance.
