When preparing for technical interviews, understanding a company's specific focus areas can dramatically increase your efficiency. Atlassian and eBay, while both major tech firms, show distinct patterns in their interview question banks. Atlassian's list comprises 62 questions, categorized as 7 Easy, 43 Medium, and 12 Hard. eBay's is very similar in volume at 60 questions, but with a slightly different difficulty spread: 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard. Both heavily emphasize four core data structure topics: Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting. This comparison breaks down the nuances to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total question counts are nearly identical, making the overall preparation load comparable. The primary difference lies in the difficulty distribution.

**Atlassian** has a steeper curve, with fewer Easy questions (7) and more Hard questions (12). This suggests their interviews may place a greater emphasis on complex problem-solving and algorithmic optimization from the outset. You are expected to handle Medium-difficulty problems reliably, as they form the bulk (43) of the question bank.

**eBay** presents a gentler initial slope, with almost double the number of Easy questions (12) and slightly fewer Hard ones (10). This could indicate that their process might include more foundational questions to warm up or assess baseline competency before diving into more challenging scenarios. However, Medium problems remain the central pillar (38), as with Atlassian.

In practice, this means for Atlassian, you should prioritize achieving high proficiency with Medium problems and ensure you are comfortable tackling a significant number of Hards. For eBay, while you must still master Mediums, a strong, error-free command of Easy and common Medium problems might be weighted more heavily.

## Topic Overlap

The core topic overlap is significant and should be the foundation of your study for either company. The combination of **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting** points to a heavy focus on linear data structures, efficient lookup, and data organization.

- **Array/String** problems often involve two-pointers, sliding window, or prefix-sum techniques.
- **Hash Table** is frequently the key to optimizing lookups from O(n) to O(1), used in problems involving counts, existence checks, or mapping relationships.
- **Sorting** is both a direct operation and a preparatory step for other algorithms like two-pointers or greedy approaches.

A problem exemplifying this overlap is checking if two strings are anagrams. The optimal solution uses a Hash Table for counting, which inherently involves String and Array (for character access) concepts.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for char in t:
        if char not in count or count[char] == 0:
            return False
        count[char] -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = new Map();
  for (let char of s) {
    count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (let char of t) {
    if (!count.has(char) || count.get(char) === 0) return false;
    count.set(char, count.get(char) - 1);
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
    int[] count = new int[26]; // Assuming lowercase English letters
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count[c - 'a']++;
    }
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (--count[c - 'a'] < 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Given the near-identical topic lists, deep mastery of these four areas will serve you for interviews at both companies.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are targeting both companies, **start with Atlassian's question list**. The reasoning is tactical: preparing for its slightly higher difficulty curve will inherently cover eBay's requirements. By solving Atlassian's 12 Hard and 43 Medium problems, you will be more than prepared for eBay's 10 Hard and 38 Medium problems. The core topics are the same, so you are not learning different material—you are training at a higher intensity.

Focus your study in this order:

1.  **Master the shared fundamentals:** Ensure you can solve Easy/Medium problems on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting without hesitation.
2.  **Tackle Atlassian's Mediums:** This is the largest common block. Use these problems to build speed and pattern recognition.
3.  **Conquer the Hards:** Primarily from Atlassian's list. This will build the problem-solving stamina and optimization skills needed for both interviews.
4.  **Review eBay's Easy/Mediums:** Use eBay's specific list for final review and to identify any subtle gaps in your foundational knowledge.

This approach maximizes your readiness for the more challenging interview (Atlassian) while ensuring comprehensive coverage for the other (eBay).
