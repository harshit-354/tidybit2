When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. LinkedIn and Zoho are prominent tech employers, but their interview question banks on coding platforms reveal distinct priorities in volume, difficulty, and core topics. Analyzing these patterns helps you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of questions is nearly identical: LinkedIn has 180 and Zoho has 179. The key difference lies in their difficulty distribution.

**LinkedIn's** set (Easy: 26, Medium: 117, Hard: 37) is heavily skewed toward medium and hard problems. With 85% of questions at Medium or Hard difficulty, LinkedIn's interviews are known for assessing complex problem-solving and algorithmic optimization under pressure. The high number of Hard questions (37) suggests you may encounter multi-step challenges or problems requiring advanced data structure knowledge.

**Zoho's** distribution (Easy: 62, Medium: 97, Hard: 20) presents a more balanced curve. Over a third of its questions are Easy, focusing on foundational logic and implementation. While Medium problems form the bulk, the smaller proportion of Hard questions (just 20) indicates interviews may prioritize correctness, clean code, and problem-solving approach on moderately complex problems over extreme algorithmic depth.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize **Array** and **String** manipulation, as well as **Hash Table** usage. These are fundamental building blocks for most coding interviews.

- **LinkedIn's** fourth major topic is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This points to a strong emphasis on graph and tree traversal problems, which are common in systems dealing with networks, hierarchies (like the professional graph itself), or nested structures.

- **Zoho's** fourth key area is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This highlights an interview focus on optimization problems, recursive thinking, and breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems. It's crucial for questions involving maximization, minimization, or counting ways.

This divergence is significant. Preparing for LinkedIn demands deep practice in recursive traversal and graph algorithms, while Zoho preparation requires drilling into classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, etc.) and state transition.

**Example: A Problem Approach**
Consider a problem asking for the maximum sum path in a binary tree.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python (DFS approach for LinkedIn-style)
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def maxPathSum(root):
    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal max_sum
        if not node:
            return 0
        left_gain = max(dfs(node.left), 0)
        right_gain = max(dfs(node.right), 0)
        path_sum = node.val + left_gain + right_gain
        max_sum = max(max_sum, path_sum)
        return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)

    max_sum = float('-inf')
    dfs(root)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
// JavaScript (DFS approach for LinkedIn-style)
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
  this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
  this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
  this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
}

function maxPathSum(root) {
  let maxSum = -Infinity;

  function dfs(node) {
    if (!node) return 0;
    const leftGain = Math.max(dfs(node.left), 0);
    const rightGain = Math.max(dfs(node.right), 0);
    const pathSum = node.val + leftGain + rightGain;
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, pathSum);
    return node.val + Math.max(leftGain, rightGain);
  }

  dfs(root);
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
// Java (DFS approach for LinkedIn-style)
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

class Solution {
    private int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxSum;
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int leftGain = Math.max(dfs(node.left), 0);
        int rightGain = Math.max(dfs(node.right), 0);
        int pathSum = node.val + leftGain + rightGain;
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, pathSum);
        return node.val + Math.max(leftGain, rightGain);
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Zoho** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. The higher volume of Easy questions allows you to solidify fundamentals in arrays, strings, and hashing. The significant Dynamic Programming focus provides a structured topic to master, which is a transferable skill for many other companies. You can build confidence by solving a larger number of approachable problems before tackling more complex ones.

Prioritize **LinkedIn** if you are already comfortable with core data structures and medium-difficulty problems. Its question bank will push you into advanced graph traversal and optimization challenges. Success here requires not just solving a problem, but often finding the optimal solution. Mastering LinkedIn's set will thoroughly prepare you for a wide range of high-tier company interviews.

Ultimately, the shared focus on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both. Then, branch into Depth-First Search for LinkedIn or Dynamic Programming for Zoho to complete your targeted preparation.
