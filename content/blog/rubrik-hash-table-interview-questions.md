Hash Table questions appear in over 25% of Rubrik's technical interview question pool (10 out of 37 total problems). This frequency reflects their critical role in the company's core engineering work. Rubrik builds data management and backup solutions, which fundamentally involve indexing, deduplication, rapid data lookup, and metadata management. Efficiently mapping identifiers to data blocks, checking for existing content, or managing state often comes down to hash table operations. Mastering them demonstrates you can think about the performance and scalability of data structures that are central to their systems.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Rubrik's hash table questions typically test your ability to recognize when a hash map or hash set is the optimal tool and to implement it effectively within a broader algorithm. Expect these categories:

1.  **Frequency Counting:** The most common pattern. You'll be given an array or string and asked to track counts of elements (e.g., find the most frequent item, check if two strings are anagrams, or identify duplicates).
2.  **Mapping for Lookup:** Problems where you need to store computed results or relationships to avoid repeated work. This includes two-sum variants, or mapping keys (like serialized tree nodes) to values.
3.  **Deduplication and State Tracking:** Using a hash set to track seen elements, nodes in a graph, or visited states to prevent cycles or redundant processing.
4.  **Integrated Design:** In later rounds, you may see design questions where a hash table is a core component of a larger system, like designing a cache (LRU) or a data indexing service.

The problems often have constraints that make an O(n²) nested loop solution unacceptable, pushing you toward the O(n) average-time solution a hash table provides.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on pattern recognition, not memorization. When you see a problem requiring frequent lookups, membership tests, or relationship pairing, a hash table should be your first instinct. Practice writing clean, bug-free implementations of hash map and set usage. Always discuss trade-offs: mention the O(n) space cost and the theoretical worst-case O(n) time for operations if all keys collide.

A key pattern is using a hash map to store a needed complement or predecessor. The classic "Two Sum" problem is a perfect example. The brute force solution checks every pair (O(n²)). The optimal approach uses a single pass: for each number, check if its needed complement (target - current) is already in the map. If not, store the current number and its index.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Master Fundamentals:** Start with pure frequency counting (LeetCode 242: Valid Anagram) and the Two Sum pattern.
2.  **Handle Complexity:** Move to problems where the hash table stores more complex data, like lists or other objects (LeetCode 49: Group Anagrams, LeetCode 1: Two Sum variants).
3.  **Combine with Other Structures:** Practice problems where a hash table works in tandem with a linked list (LRU Cache) or a heap (Top K Frequent Elements).
4.  **Simulate Rubrik Problems:** Finally, practice the specific hash table questions tagged for Rubrik on platforms like TidyBit to familiarize yourself with their style and difficulty.
