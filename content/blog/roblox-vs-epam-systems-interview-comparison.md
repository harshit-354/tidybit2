When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Roblox and EPAM Systems, while both assessing core algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their interview question patterns to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions and their difficulty spread reveals each company's screening intensity.

**Roblox (56 questions)** maintains a more challenging overall profile. Its distribution is 8 Easy (E8), 36 Medium (M36), and 12 Hard (H12) questions. This indicates a strong emphasis on medium-difficulty problems, which form the core of their technical rounds, with a significant number of hard questions used to differentiate top candidates, especially for senior roles.

**EPAM Systems (51 questions)** has a notably different distribution: 19 Easy (E19), 30 Medium (M30), and only 2 Hard (H2) questions. This profile suggests a focus on foundational competency and problem-solving clarity. The interview process is likely designed to reliably assess a candidate's grasp of core concepts and coding ability, with less weight placed on solving highly complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with subtle shifts in priority that can guide your study time.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are central to both companies' question banks. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures. A common pattern is using a hash table to optimize array or string traversal.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table with Array)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table with Array)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table with Array)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

**Diverging Emphasis:**

- **Roblox** uniquely lists **Math** as a top topic. Expect problems involving number theory, simulation, or mathematical reasoning alongside data structure manipulation.
- **EPAM Systems** explicitly highlights **Two Pointers** as a key technique. Be ready to solve array and string problems (e.g., removing duplicates, validating palindromes, or sliding window subarrays) using this efficient pattern.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (Removing Duplicates from Sorted Array)
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (Removing Duplicates from Sorted Array)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (Removing Duplicates from Sorted Array)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your interview timeline and the difficulty curve you want to tackle.

**Prepare for EPAM Systems first if** you are early in your interview practice or want to build confidence. The higher proportion of Easy questions and the clear focus on core techniques (Two Pointers, Hash Table) provide a solid, manageable foundation. Mastering these will make you interview-ready for EPAM and establish a strong base for more challenging problems.

**Prepare for Roblox first if** you are targeting senior roles, have a strong foundational grasp already, or your interview is sooner. The prevalence of Medium and Hard questions means you need to allocate more time for deep practice. Starting here forces you to level up quickly. Ensure you dedicate specific study time to Math-based problems, which are a distinguishing part of their question bank.

Ultimately, the core topics overlap significantly. A robust preparation plan focusing on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables, with dedicated practice on Two Pointers for EPAM and Math for Roblox, will cover the majority of questions from both companies.
