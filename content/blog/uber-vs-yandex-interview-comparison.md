When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution can significantly streamline your study process. Uber and Yandex, while both prominent in their regions (global and Russia/CIS respectively), present distinct interview landscapes. Uber's process is known for its high volume and algorithmic rigor, often mirroring other FAANG-level companies, whereas Yandex's process, while still challenging, tends to have a more concentrated scope with a notable emphasis on practical problem-solving.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a stark difference in scale. Uber has a catalog of **381** documented interview questions, while Yandex has **134**. This volume alone suggests that preparing for Uber requires a broader, more exhaustive review of potential problems.

The difficulty distribution is more revealing:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103)**: The spread is heavily weighted towards **Medium (224)** and **Hard (103)** problems, with fewer Easy ones. This indicates an interview process that deeply tests algorithmic optimization and complex scenario handling. Success here requires mastery beyond fundamental patterns.
- **Yandex (E52/M72/H10)**: The distribution is inverted relative to Uber. There are nearly as many **Easy (52)** questions as Medium **(72)**, and very few **Hard (10)**. This suggests Yandex interviews frequently start with foundational checks and progress to solid, practical medium-difficulty problems, with less frequent ultra-complex algorithmic hurdles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies strongly emphasize core data structures. **Array, Hash Table, and String** problems are top topics for both, forming a critical common ground for preparation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Uber heavily features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a staple for high-difficulty interviews assessing advanced problem decomposition and optimization. Yandex, conversely, shows a stronger focus on **Two Pointers**, a pattern essential for efficient array and string manipulation but generally associated with medium difficulty.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Uber-frequent: Dynamic Programming (Coin Change)
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Yandex-frequent: Two Pointers (Container With Most Water)
function maxArea(height) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let maxArea = 0;
  while (left < right) {
    const area = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return maxArea;
}
```

```java
// Yandex-frequent: Two Pointers (Container With Most Water)
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int maxArea = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        int area = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing with both, **prioritize Uber preparation first**. Mastering the wide range of Medium and Hard problems, especially in Dynamic Programming, required for Uber will inherently cover the core (Array, Hash Table, String) and medium-difficulty (Two Pointers) problems that are common at Yandex. The reverse is not true; focusing solely on Yandex's scope would leave significant gaps for Uber's harder questions.

A strategic plan is:

1.  **Solidify Foundations**: Master Array, Hash Table, String, and Two Pointer patterns thoroughly.
2.  **Tackle Uber Depth**: Dive into Medium and Hard problems, with dedicated practice on Dynamic Programming, Graph algorithms, and system design thinking.
3.  **Yandex Review**: Closer to a Yandex interview, run through their specific question list to familiarize yourself with their problem style and difficulty curve, which will feel more manageable after Uber prep.

This approach builds a maximum-coverage skill set efficiently.
