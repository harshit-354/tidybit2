When preparing for technical interviews at major companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Walmart Labs and JPMorgan represent two distinct industry domains—retail tech and financial services—which is reflected in their interview question profiles. While there is significant overlap in fundamental topics, the volume, difficulty distribution, and emphasis differ, requiring tailored preparation strategies.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in scale and challenge.

**Walmart Labs** has a larger, more challenging question bank with **152 questions** (Easy: 22, Medium: 105, Hard: 25). The high proportion of Medium and Hard questions (over 85%) indicates interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving and algorithmic skills. You should expect multi-layered problems that require optimizing for time and space complexity.

**JPMorgan** has a smaller, more accessible bank of **78 questions** (Easy: 25, Medium: 45, Hard: 8). The difficulty skews significantly toward Easy and Medium, with Hard questions making up only about 10% of the total. This suggests a stronger focus on assessing core competency, clean code, and logical reasoning rather than solving esoteric algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. The core shared topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Array/String Manipulation:** Expect questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and string parsing.
- **Hash Table Usage:** Crucial for efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving problems like Two Sum.

The key differentiator is in the advanced topics.

**Walmart Labs** explicitly includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This signals a need to prepare for optimization problems involving recursion with memoization or tabulation, such as classic knapsack, longest common subsequence, or pathfinding problems.

**JPMorgan** lists **Sorting** as a distinct focus area. While sorting is a fundamental concept, its explicit mention suggests potential questions on custom comparators, leveraging sorted order for efficient solutions (like two-pointer on a sorted array), or understanding sorting algorithm trade-offs.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target companies and timeline.

**Prepare for JPMorgan first if:** You are early in your interview prep cycle or want to build confidence. The broader base of Easy/Medium questions allows you to solidify fundamentals in the shared topics (Array, String, Hash Table) without the initial pressure of complex DP. Success here builds a strong foundation that is directly transferable.

**Prepare for Walmart Labs first if:** You are targeting tech-centric roles or have more time to dive deep. The prevalence of Medium and Hard questions, including DP, demands rigorous practice. Mastering this curriculum will inherently cover the core difficulty level needed for JPMorgan, making subsequent preparation for JPMorgan feel comparatively lighter. You will need to allocate dedicated time to learn and pattern-match DP problems.

A strategic hybrid approach is to **start with the shared core**. Achieve fluency with array/string manipulation and hash table patterns. Then, based on your interview schedule, branch out: add Sorting deep dives for JPMorgan or initiate a structured DP study plan for Walmart Labs.
