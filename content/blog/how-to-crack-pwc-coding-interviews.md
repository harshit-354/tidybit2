PwC’s technical interviews for software and data roles are designed to assess practical problem-solving and coding fundamentals. While not as algorithmically intense as some FAANG companies, PwC focuses on clean code, logical reasoning, and the ability to handle real-world data scenarios. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live IDE, focusing on data manipulation, string processing, and efficient lookup.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, PwC's coding questions break down as follows: 75% Easy, 0% Medium, and 25% Hard. This distribution is revealing. The high percentage of Easy problems means you must execute flawlessly on fundamentals—arrays, strings, and hash table operations must be second nature. There is no room for error on these. The absence of Medium questions creates a stark jump. The 25% Hard problems act as a key differentiator, often testing advanced data structure application (like Tries) or optimized search. Your success hinges on dominating the Easy problems to secure a baseline, then tackling the Hard problem to stand out.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Hash Table, Trie, and Binary Search. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array & String:** These form the bedrock. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and sliding window techniques for subarray/substring questions.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. It's essential for frequency counting, deduplication, and memoization in almost any problem.
- **Trie:** A specialized but critical data structure for PwC, especially in Hard problems. It's used for efficient prefix-based search and retrieval, common in dictionary or autocomplete-style questions.
- **Binary Search:** Applied not just on sorted arrays, but also in search space reduction problems (e.g., finding the minimum capacity to ship packages). This is key for optimization.

The most important pattern to internalize is the **Hash Table for Frequency Counting**. It's the workhorse for solving a majority of Easy problems involving strings and arrays.

```python
def find_anagram_indices(s, p):
    """Find all start indices of p's anagrams in string s."""
    if len(p) > len(s):
        return []

    p_count = {}
    window_count = {}

    # Build frequency map for pattern p and first window of s
    for i in range(len(p)):
        p_count[p[i]] = p_count.get(p[i], 0) + 1
        window_count[s[i]] = window_count.get(s[i], 0) + 1

    result = [0] if p_count == window_count else []

    # Slide the window
    for i in range(len(p), len(s)):
        # Add new character to the window
        window_count[s[i]] = window_count.get(s[i], 0) + 1
        # Remove the character leaving the window
        left_char = s[i - len(p)]
        window_count[left_char] -= 1
        if window_count[left_char] == 0:
            del window_count[left_char]
        # Compare frequency maps
        if window_count == p_count:
            result.append(i - len(p) + 1)

    return result
```

```javascript
function findAnagramIndices(s, p) {
  if (p.length > s.length) return [];

  const pCount = new Map();
  const windowCount = new Map();

  // Build frequency maps
  for (let i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
    pCount.set(p[i], (pCount.get(p[i]) || 0) + 1);
    windowCount.set(s[i], (windowCount.get(s[i]) || 0) + 1);
  }

  const areMapsEqual = (map1, map2) => {
    if (map1.size !== map2.size) return false;
    for (let [key, val] of map1) {
      if (val !== map2.get(key)) return false;
    }
    return true;
  };

  const result = areMapsEqual(pCount, windowCount) ? [0] : [];

  // Slide the window
  for (let i = p.length; i < s.length; i++) {
    // Add new char
    windowCount.set(s[i], (windowCount.get(s[i]) || 0) + 1);
    // Remove old char
    const leftChar = s[i - p.length];
    windowCount.set(leftChar, windowCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
    if (windowCount.get(leftChar) === 0) {
      windowCount.delete(leftChar);
    }
    // Compare
    if (areMapsEqual(pCount, windowCount)) {
      result.push(i - p.length + 1);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public List<Integer> findAnagramIndices(String s, String p) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (p.length() > s.length()) return result;

    Map<Character, Integer> pCount = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> windowCount = new HashMap<>();

    // Build frequency maps
    for (int i = 0; i < p.length(); i++) {
        pCount.put(p.charAt(i), pCount.getOrDefault(p.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        windowCount.put(s.charAt(i), windowCount.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
    }

    if (pCount.equals(windowCount)) result.add(0);

    // Slide the window
    for (int i = p.length(); i < s.length(); i++) {
        // Add new char
        char newChar = s.charAt(i);
        windowCount.put(newChar, windowCount.getOrDefault(newChar, 0) + 1);
        // Remove old char
        char oldChar = s.charAt(i - p.length());
        windowCount.put(oldChar, windowCount.get(oldChar) - 1);
        if (windowCount.get(oldChar) == 0) {
            windowCount.remove(oldChar);
        }
        // Compare
        if (pCount.equals(windowCount)) {
            result.add(i - p.length() + 1);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach is optimal given PwC's specific distribution.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Easy Domination**

- Dedicate this period entirely to **Easy** problems on TidyBit, filtered by PwC's top topics: Array, String, and Hash Table.
- Solve 2-3 problems daily. Your goal is 100% accuracy and speed. Practice writing syntactically perfect code on a whiteboard or in a plain editor without autocomplete.

**Weeks 3-4: Tackling the Hard Differentiator**

- Shift focus to **Hard** problems, specifically those involving **Tries** and advanced **Binary Search** applications.
- Implement a Trie from scratch in your language of choice until you can do it blindfolded. Solve 1-2 Hard problems every other day, focusing deeply on the thought process.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews**

- Mix Easy and Hard problems in timed sessions (60-75 minutes) to simulate the actual interview jump in difficulty.
- Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or mentor. Articulate your reasoning clearly, as PwC values communication. Re-solve all previously attempted PwC-specific questions.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** For the 75% Easy questions, a brute-force solution that is perfectly correct is better than an optimal one with a bug. Write clear, readable code first, then optimize if time permits.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code:** State the brute-force approach upfront, then discuss optimizations (e.g., "We can use a hash map here to reduce the lookup from O(n) to O(1)"). This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Practice Trie Implementation:** Since it's a niche topic that appears in Hard problems, being able to quickly implement the `insert` and `search` methods will give you a significant advantage. Memorize the standard node structure and methods.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicate values. This shows thoroughness.
5.  **Know Your Language's Data Structures:** Be proficient with the built-in implementations of hash tables (`dict`, `Map`, `HashMap`), arrays/lists, and strings. Know the time complexity of common operations like lookup, insertion, and slicing.

Mastering this focused approach will allow you to confidently handle PwC's distinct mix of fundamental execution and complex problem-solving.
