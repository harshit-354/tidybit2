When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty profiles can dramatically increase your efficiency. ServiceNow and Samsung, while both being large technology corporations, present distinct interview landscapes. ServiceNow, a leader in enterprise cloud computing, tends to ask questions that test foundational data structure manipulation for workflow and system logic. Samsung, a global electronics and engineering conglomerate, often includes problems that require efficient algorithmic solutions, sometimes with an engineering or simulation twist. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear strategic differences for candidates.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows ServiceNow has a slightly larger question pool (78 questions) compared to Samsung's 69. However, the difficulty distribution is more telling.

**ServiceNow** (78q: E8/M58/H12) demonstrates a heavy concentration on **Medium** difficulty problems. With 58 Medium questions (roughly 74% of its total), the interview process seems designed to consistently evaluate a candidate's core competency in applying standard algorithms to slightly varied scenarios. The relatively low count of Hard questions (12) suggests that while advanced problem-solving is assessed, the primary gate is solid, reliable performance on mainstream challenges.

**Samsung** (69q: E15/M37/H17) presents a more balanced spread. Its proportion of Hard questions (17, or ~25%) is significantly higher than ServiceNow's. The increased number of Easy questions (15) might indicate a screening phase or questions that test basic implementation skills. This distribution points to an interview process that may have more distinct tiers, potentially filtering candidates with simpler problems before presenting substantial algorithmic challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as critical topics, reflecting their importance in algorithmic interviews generally.

- **Array** manipulation is fundamental to both.
- **Dynamic Programming** is a key focus, testing optimization and state management.

The secondary topics highlight each company's nuance:

- **ServiceNow** strongly features **String** and **Hash Table** problems. This aligns with enterprise software development, where processing text data (configurations, service names, queries) and efficient lookups (for asset or user management) are daily tasks.
- **Samsung** frequently uses **Two Pointers** and **Hash Table** techniques. Two Pointers is often used in problems related to sequences, intervals, or optimized searches on sorted data—common in low-level system optimization, signal processing, or memory-efficient algorithms relevant to hardware-adjacent software.

Here is a typical problem that might appear at either company, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example usage would return [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and current skill level.

If your goal is **ServiceNow**, prioritize mastering **Medium-difficulty problems** across the core topics. Drill deeply into String manipulation (reversal, parsing, matching) and Hash Table applications (counting, caching). A strong, methodical approach to common patterns will serve you better than tackling the most esoteric Hard problems.

If your goal is **Samsung**, build a broader foundation. Ensure you are very comfortable with Easy and Medium problems for speed and accuracy, but allocate significant time to **challenging Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers problems**. Be prepared for a wider difficulty range during the interview.

For a generalist preparing for both, **start with the common core**. Focus intensely on **Array and Dynamic Programming**. Achieving high proficiency here will build a foundation applicable to both companies. Then, branch out: practice String problems for ServiceNow and Two Pointers for Samsung. Given the high volume of Medium questions for ServiceNow, using its question bank for drill practice is excellent for building consistent competency, while practicing Samsung's question bank will better test your limits with harder problems.
