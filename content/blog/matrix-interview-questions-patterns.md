Matrix problems are a staple of coding interviews because they test multiple skills simultaneously: navigating 2D data structures, implementing efficient algorithms, and managing edge cases. A matrix (or 2D array) is more than just a grid of numbers; it's a domain where you must track indices, directions, and boundaries precisely. With 205 cataloged questions, it's a high-frequency topic you cannot afford to overlook.

## Common Patterns

Mastering a few core patterns will allow you to decompose most matrix problems into manageable steps.

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) / Flood Fill

This pattern is used for traversing connected regions, such as in "Number of Islands" or "Rotting Oranges." You recursively explore adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) from a starting point, marking visited cells to avoid cycles.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dfs(matrix, r, c):
    # Check boundaries and validity
    if r < 0 or r >= len(matrix) or c < 0 or c >= len(matrix[0]) or matrix[r][c] != 1:
        return
    # Mark as visited
    matrix[r][c] = 0
    # Explore 4 directions
    dfs(matrix, r+1, c)
    dfs(matrix, r-1, c)
    dfs(matrix, r, c+1)
    dfs(matrix, r, c-1)
```

```javascript
function dfs(matrix, r, c) {
  if (r < 0 || r >= matrix.length || c < 0 || c >= matrix[0].length || matrix[r][c] !== 1) {
    return;
  }
  matrix[r][c] = 0;
  dfs(matrix, r + 1, c);
  dfs(matrix, r - 1, c);
  dfs(matrix, r, c + 1);
  dfs(matrix, r, c - 1);
}
```

```java
public void dfs(int[][] matrix, int r, int c) {
    if (r < 0 || r >= matrix.length || c < 0 || c >= matrix[0].length || matrix[r][c] != 1) {
        return;
    }
    matrix[r][c] = 0;
    dfs(matrix, r+1, c);
    dfs(matrix, r-1, c);
    dfs(matrix, r, c+1);
    dfs(matrix, r, c-1);
}
```

</div>

### 2. Layer-by-Layer (Spiral Order)

Problems like "Spiral Matrix" require processing the matrix in layers, moving from the outer perimeter inward. You track four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

### 3. Dynamic Programming on Grids

For problems involving paths or maximum/minimum sums (e.g., "Minimum Path Sum"), DP is key. You build a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the optimal solution to reach cell `(i, j)`.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    # Fill first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    # Fill first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    # Fill rest
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

```javascript
function minPathSum(grid) {
  const m = grid.length,
    n = grid[0].length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => new Array(n).fill(0));
  dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
  for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
    }
  }
  return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```

```java
public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
    int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}
```

## Difficulty Breakdown

Of the 205 questions:

- **Easy (34 questions, 17%):** These test fundamental navigation and iteration. Examples include matrix traversal or simple searches. They are often warm-ups.
- **Medium (117 questions, 57%):** This is the core battleground. Problems here combine patterns like DFS, BFS, or simulation with careful index management. "Rotting Oranges" and "Spiral Matrix" are classic examples.
- **Hard (54 questions, 26%):** These involve complex algorithms layered onto the matrix structure, such as advanced dynamic programming, binary search on matrix rows/columns, or intricate simulations.

The 57% medium skew means interviewers frequently use matrix problems to assess if you can handle moderate complexity under pressure.

## Which Companies Ask Matrix Questions

Matrix problems are particularly common at top tech companies that need to evaluate algorithmic thinking on structured data.

- [Google](/company/google) often asks matrix DFS and DP problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Meta](/company/meta) frequently include matrix traversal and simulation in their interviews.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) use matrix problems to test for clean, bug-free code handling edge cases.

## Study Tips

1.  **Visualize and Draw.** Before coding, sketch the matrix. Mark your starting point, direction of movement, and boundaries. This prevents index errors.
2.  **Practice Boundary Checks.** Always write the condition for valid cell access first. A common template is: `if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || condition) return;`
3.  **Start with Core Patterns.** Drill problems for DFS/BFS, spiral traversal, and DP on grids. Solve 2-3 problems for each pattern to build intuition.
4.  **Simulate by Hand.** For simulation problems (e.g., "Game of Life"), manually step through a small example to derive the rules before implementing.

Matrix problems are conquerable through pattern recognition and methodical practice. Focus on the core techniques, and you'll be able to navigate any grid an interviewer puts in front of you.
