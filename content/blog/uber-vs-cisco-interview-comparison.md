When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. Uber and Cisco, while both major tech employers, have distinct engineering cultures and product focuses, which is reflected in their interview question banks. Uber's extensive dataset of 381 questions indicates a highly competitive, algorithm-intensive process typical of large consumer tech companies. Cisco's smaller set of 86 questions suggests a more focused, potentially domain-aware interview style, common in enterprise networking and infrastructure roles. Understanding the differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most striking difference. Uber's list of 381 questions (54 Easy, 224 Medium, 103 Hard) is over four times larger than Cisco's 86 questions (22 Easy, 49 Medium, 15 Hard). This doesn't necessarily mean Cisco's interviews are easier, but it strongly indicates a narrower scope. Uber's massive question bank, with a significant portion (over 60%) being Medium or Hard, reflects a process designed to test depth, speed, and adaptability across a wide range of algorithmic concepts. You must be prepared for virtually any standard LeetCode-style problem. Cisco's distribution is similar in proportion (roughly 75% Medium/Hard), but the smaller absolute number suggests their interviews may revisit core patterns more frequently or place greater weight on other factors like system knowledge or behavioral fit.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize the fundamental trio: **Array, String, and Hash Table**. This is the universal core of coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key divergence is in the fourth-most frequent topic. For Uber, it's **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with Uber's focus on complex, optimization-heavy systems (matching riders/drivers, calculating routes, surge pricing). DP questions test the ability to break down intricate problems into optimal substructures—a critical skill for their domain.

For Cisco, the fourth core topic is **Two Pointers**. This technique is essential for solving problems involving sorted data, sliding windows, or in-place array/string manipulation. It's a fundamental, efficient pattern highly relevant to networking and systems programming, where processing data streams and packets efficiently is key.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (relevant for Cisco)
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return s

# Example: Dynamic Programming (relevant for Uber)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (relevant for Cisco)
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    [s[left], s[right]] = [s[right], s[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return s;
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (relevant for Uber)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (relevant for Cisco)
public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (relevant for Uber)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Cisco first** if you are early in your interview journey or prioritizing enterprise/networking roles. Its focused question set allows you to build deep mastery of core patterns (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Two Pointers) without being overwhelmed. Success here will solidify the fundamentals needed for any interview.

Prepare for **Uber first** if you are targeting top-tier consumer tech companies or have a strong algorithmic foundation already. Tackling Uber's broad and difficult problem set will force you to reach a high level of proficiency, especially in Dynamic Programming and other advanced topics. If you can handle Uber's question bank, transitioning to Cisco's more focused set will feel like a narrower, more manageable subset of your existing skills.

Ultimately, the fundamentals are the same. Start with the core trio (Array, String, Hash Table), then branch out based on your target: drill Two Pointers for Cisco, and dive deep into Dynamic Programming for Uber.
