String manipulation is a core skill for any software engineer, but at Walmart Labs, it's especially critical. With 39 String-specific questions out of their 152 total problems on TidyBit, this topic represents over 25% of their technical interview focus. Why such emphasis? Walmart's platforms—from e-commerce search and product descriptions to inventory tracking and logistics systems—process massive volumes of text data. Efficiently parsing, matching, validating, and transforming strings is fundamental to building scalable retail technology. Interviewers use these problems to assess your attention to detail, ability to handle edge cases, and mastery of fundamental algorithms on a universally understood data type.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Walmart Labs' string questions tend to be practical and algorithm-focused. You can generally categorize them into a few key patterns:

- **Pattern Matching & Searching:** Implementing or leveraging algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) for efficient substring search, or using regular expressions for validation tasks (e.g., validating product SKU formats or customer input).
- **String Transformation & Encoding:** Problems involving run-length encoding, string compression, or basic parsing tasks like converting between formats, which are common in data serialization for APIs or logs.
- **Palindrome & Anagram Checks:** Fundamental problems that test your ability to manipulate and compare character counts, often as a building block for more complex logic.
- **Sliding Window on Strings:** A dominant pattern for questions about finding the longest substring with K distinct characters, smallest window containing all characters of a pattern, or substring anagrams. This tests your grasp of two-pointer techniques and hash maps.
- **String Simulation & Parsing:** Directly simulating processes like string addition, parsing expressions, or executing simple string-based commands. These test clean, iterative coding and handling of state.

The problems rarely test obscure library knowledge; instead, they evaluate your ability to implement efficient, correct logic from first principles.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on mastering the underlying patterns, not just memorizing solutions. Practice writing bug-free code for core operations like reversing, splitting, and comparing. Always verbalize your thought process and discuss time/space complexity. Use a hash map (dictionary, object, HashMap) to track character frequencies—it's the most common auxiliary data structure for string problems.

A quintessential example is the **"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"** problem, which perfectly combines the sliding window pattern with a hash map for tracking characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        # If char is seen and is inside the current window, shrink window
        if ch in char_index and char_index[ch] >= left:
            left = char_index[ch] + 1
        # Update the character's latest index
        char_index[ch] = right
        # Update max length
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const ch = s[right];
    // If char is seen and is inside the current window, shrink window
    if (charIndex.has(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
    }
    // Update the character's latest index
    charIndex.set(ch, right);
    // Update max length
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLength;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(right);
        // If char is seen and is inside the current window, shrink window
        if (charIndex.containsKey(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
        }
        // Update the character's latest index
        charIndex.put(ch, right);
        // Update max length
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

</div>

The pattern is consistent: use two pointers (`left`, `right`) to define a window, a hash map to store the last seen index of each character, and shrink the window when a duplicate is found _within the current bounds_.

## Recommended Practice Order

Build competence progressively. Start with foundational problems like string reversal and palindrome checks. Then, move to anagram detection using hash maps. Master the sliding window pattern with problems like the one above and "Minimum Window Substring." Practice pattern matching/parsing problems next. Finally, tackle more complex simulations or multi-step encoding problems. For each problem, implement it in your primary interview language and analyze the complexity.
