Cashfree’s technical interview process is designed to assess strong foundational coding skills and the ability to solve practical, data-intensive problems. Candidates can expect a series of online coding assessments and technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, system design fundamentals, and language-specific expertise. The problems are often drawn from real-world scenarios in payments and fintech infrastructure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Cashfree's coding questions reveals a clear emphasis on intermediate problem-solving. The distribution is: **Easy (17%), Medium (67%), Hard (17%)**. This breakdown is telling. The overwhelming majority of questions are at a Medium level, indicating that the primary goal is to evaluate a candidate's consistent, reliable ability to apply core algorithms to non-trivial problems. You must be proficient in transforming problem statements into efficient solutions using standard patterns. The single Hard question acts as a differentiator, testing depth of knowledge and composure under pressure. The strategy is clear: master Medium problems to pass; be prepared for a Hard problem to excel.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Success hinges on deep familiarity with a few critical data structures and algorithms. Here are the top five topics to prioritize.

**Array & Sliding Window:** Many fintech problems involve processing continuous data streams (e.g., transaction amounts, session logs). The sliding window technique is paramount for optimizing subarray or substring computations.
**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups, essential for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or memoization in dynamic programming.
**Dynamic Programming (DP):** A cornerstone for optimization problems, such as calculating maximum profit, minimum steps, or optimal resource allocation—common themes in financial logic.
**Binary Search:** Not just for sorted arrays; applied to answer optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum maximum transaction capacity") where you can predicate a solution's feasibility.

Let's look at a quintessential Sliding Window pattern, frequently used for problems like "find the longest substring with K distinct characters" or "maximum sum subarray of size K."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    """Returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(arr) < k:
        return -1

    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Slide the window: remove leftmost, add new rightmost
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum

# Example
print(max_sum_subarray([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3))  # Output: 9 (from [5, 1, 3])
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarray(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return -1;

  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Example
console.log(maxSumSubarray([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class SlidingWindow {
    public static int maxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length < k) return -1;

        int windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        int maxSum = windowSum;

        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(maxSumSubarray(arr, 3)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a week-by-week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Hash Tables, and Sliding Window. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, focusing on pattern recognition. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter problems by company and topic.
**Week 3: Advanced Patterns.** Tackle Dynamic Programming and Binary Search. Start with classic DP problems (Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS) before moving to variations. For Binary Search, practice both standard and answer-predicate (monotonic) forms.
**Week 4: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Solve mixed-topic Medium problems under timed conditions. Simulate the interview environment. Complete 2-3 mock interviews weekly, focusing on clear communication of your thought process.
**Week 5-6 (if available): Depth & Review.** Revisit incorrect problems. Study the one Hard topic area (often DP or a complex graph). Systematically review all patterns and write clean, production-ready code for your most frequent mistakes.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Always restate the problem, discuss edge cases, and outline your approach (including time/space complexity) before writing a single line of code. Interviewers assess your problem-solving process.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** First, state a brute-force solution. Then, logically derive the optimized approach (e.g., "We can improve this from O(n²) to O(n) using a hash map to store seen elements"). This demonstrates systematic thinking.
3.  **Practice Fintech Context.** When solving problems, consider how they might map to fintech: arrays for transaction lists, sliding windows for rate limiting, DP for fee minimization, hash tables for idempotency checks.
4.  **Write Production-Quality Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases explicitly (empty input, large values, negative numbers). This shows you think about real-world code maintenance.

Mastering these patterns and executing this plan will build the muscle memory needed to succeed. Consistency beats last-minute cramming.
