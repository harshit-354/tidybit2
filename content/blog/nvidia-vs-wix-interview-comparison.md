When preparing for technical interviews at NVIDIA and Wix, you'll find both similarities and distinct differences in their question profiles. NVIDIA, a leader in GPU computing and AI, presents a significantly larger and more challenging dataset. Wix, a web development platform, focuses on a narrower, more application-oriented scope. Understanding these differences is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

NVIDIA's dataset is substantially larger and more difficult. With 137 total questions, its distribution (34 Easy, 89 Medium, 14 Hard) reveals a heavy emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. This suggests interviews are designed to thoroughly assess core algorithmic competency and problem-solving under pressure. The high volume means you must be prepared for a wide variety of problem types within their core topics.

Wix's dataset is more compact at 56 questions, with a distribution of 16 Easy, 31 Medium, and 9 Hard. The focus is also on Medium problems, but the overall lower volume and slightly lower proportion of Hard questions indicate a slightly less intense algorithmic bar. The interview likely balances algorithmic skill with practical, domain-relevant knowledge.

**Preparation Implication:** For NVIDIA, you need broad, deep, and fast practice across many Medium problems. For Wix, you can afford more focused, in-depth practice on a smaller set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies strongly emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These are foundational for assessing data manipulation, logic, and efficient lookup. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **NVIDIA** lists **Sorting**. This includes not just using built-in sorts, but implementing custom comparators, leveraging sorting as a pre-processing step for other algorithms (like two-pointer techniques), and solving problems about sorting logic itself.
- **Wix** lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This aligns with web development's tree-like structures (e.g., the DOM, component hierarchies, site navigation). DFS questions test recursive thinking and systematic traversal.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example of a Sorting-centric problem pattern: Custom comparator.
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Sort by the start time
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
# Then merge overlapping intervals...
```

```javascript
// Example of a DFS problem pattern: Tree traversal.
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example of a Sorting-centric problem pattern: Custom comparator.
Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
// Then merge overlapping intervals...

// Example of a DFS problem pattern: Tree traversal.
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

</div>

This difference is telling: NVIDIA's focus on **Sorting** points to fundamentals of algorithm design and optimization. Wix's focus on **DFS** points to practical data structure traversal relevant to their product.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by the **foundational overlap**.

1.  **Start with the Common Core:** Dedicate your initial effort to mastering problems involving **Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables**. Proficiency here will serve you for both companies and forms the basis for most other topics. Practice until you can identify the appropriate data structure and implement solutions fluently.

2.  **Then Branch Based on Target:**
    - If **NVIDIA** is your goal, pivot next to **Sorting** algorithms and their applications. Practice problems that involve `sorting + two pointers`, `sorting + greedy`, and writing custom sort functions. The large volume of Medium questions means you need stamina and speed.
    - If **Wix** is your goal, pivot next to **Tree and Graph traversal** (DFS, BFS). Practice problems on binary trees, n-ary trees, and representing graphs. Given their domain, also be prepared for potential questions that mix these concepts with real-world web scenarios.

A strategic approach is to use Wix's more focused list as an initial benchmark for core competency. If you can comfortably solve most of their Medium problems, you have a solid base. Then, scale up to NVIDIA's larger and more demanding set to build the breadth, speed, and depth they require.
