## Why Counting Sort Matters in Interviews

Counting Sort is a fundamental algorithm that interviewers use to test your understanding of non-comparison based sorting and your ability to recognize when a problem's constraints allow for an optimized, linear-time solution. Unlike comparison sorts like QuickSort or MergeSort, which have a lower bound of O(n log n), Counting Sort can achieve O(n + k) time by counting occurrences of each value. This makes it critical for problems involving a limited range of integer values, frequency counting, or when you need to sort data with known bounds. Mastering it demonstrates you can move beyond brute force and apply constraint-aware optimizations.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Frequency Array for Bounded Values

The core pattern involves creating an array where the index represents a value from the input, and the value at that index represents its frequency. This is used when the input range is known and reasonably small.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def count_sort_frequency(arr, max_val):
    count = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for num in arr:
        count[num] += 1

    sorted_arr = []
    for val in range(len(count)):
        sorted_arr.extend([val] * count[val])
    return sorted_arr
```

```javascript
function countSortFrequency(arr, maxVal) {
  const count = new Array(maxVal + 1).fill(0);
  for (const num of arr) {
    count[num]++;
  }

  const sortedArr = [];
  for (let val = 0; val < count.length; val++) {
    for (let i = 0; i < count[val]; i++) {
      sortedArr.push(val);
    }
  }
  return sortedArr;
}
```

```java
public int[] countSortFrequency(int[] arr, int maxVal) {
    int[] count = new int[maxVal + 1];
    for (int num : arr) {
        count[num]++;
    }

    int[] sortedArr = new int[arr.length];
    int idx = 0;
    for (int val = 0; val < count.length; val++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < count[val]; i++) {
            sortedArr[idx++] = val;
        }
    }
    return sortedArr;
}
```

</div>

### 2. Prefix Sum for Stable Sorting

For a stable sort or when used as a subroutine in more complex algorithms like Radix Sort, you convert the frequency array into a prefix sum (or cumulative count) array. This array determines the correct output positions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def stable_counting_sort(arr, max_val):
    count = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for num in arr:
        count[num] += 1

    # Convert to prefix sum
    for i in range(1, len(count)):
        count[i] += count[i - 1]

    output = [0] * len(arr)
    # Iterate backwards to maintain stability
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        num = arr[i]
        output[count[num] - 1] = num
        count[num] -= 1
    return output
```

```javascript
function stableCountingSort(arr, maxVal) {
  const count = new Array(maxVal + 1).fill(0);
  for (const num of arr) {
    count[num]++;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < count.length; i++) {
    count[i] += count[i - 1];
  }

  const output = new Array(arr.length);
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const num = arr[i];
    output[count[num] - 1] = num;
    count[num]--;
  }
  return output;
}
```

```java
public int[] stableCountingSort(int[] arr, int maxVal) {
    int[] count = new int[maxVal + 1];
    for (int num : arr) {
        count[num]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < count.length; i++) {
        count[i] += count[i - 1];
    }

    int[] output = new int[arr.length];
    for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int num = arr[i];
        output[count[num] - 1] = num;
        count[num]--;
    }
    return output;
}
```

</div>

### 3. Frequency-Based Problem Solving

Many problems don't require a fully sorted output but use the frequency array for quick lookups, comparisons, or finding duplicates/missing numbers. The pattern is to build the count array and then analyze it.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a split of 56% Easy and 44% Medium questions, with no Hard problems. This distribution is telling.

Easy questions typically test your ability to implement the basic algorithm or apply it directly to a constrained scenario, like sorting an array of small integers. They verify you understand the core mechanics.

Medium questions require you to integrate Counting Sort as a key step within a larger problem. Examples include finding the minimum number of swaps to make arrays equal, solving anagram-related problems, or handling character frequency in strings. The challenge lies in recognizing that the bounded nature of the input (e.g., lowercase English letters have 26 possible values) makes Counting Sort the optimal tool.

The absence of Hard questions indicates that Counting Sort is rarely the primary complexity in a highly difficult problem. It's more often a component that enables an efficient solution for a specific sub-problem. Your focus should be on pattern recognition and integration, not on implementing extremely complex variations.

## Which Companies Ask Counting Sort

Top companies frequently include Counting Sort in their interview loops because it tests fundamental algorithmic thinking and optimization skills.

- **[Amazon](/company/amazon)** often asks questions involving frequency counts of characters or items, common in string manipulation and data processing problems.
- **[Google](/company/google)** and **[Meta](/company/meta)** use it in problems related to sorting with constraints, user engagement analytics (e.g., counting events within ranges), and preprocessing for more complex algorithms.
- **[Microsoft](/company/microsoft)** and **[Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg)** include it in interviews for roles dealing with financial data or system design where efficient sorting of bounded integer keys is relevant.

## Study Tips

1.  **Memorize the Range Constraint:** The single most important trigger for considering Counting Sort is the phrase "values are in a limited range" or "0 <= arr[i] < k" where k is reasonably small (e.g., 100, 1000, or 26 for letters). Immediately think frequency array.
2.  **Practice the Two Implementations:** Be fluent in both the simple frequency reconstruction version and the stable prefix sum version. Understand _why_ the prefix sum version is stable and when that property matters.
3.  **Map Problems to the Pattern:** Don't just sort. Practice problems where the frequency array is the answer itself—like finding the missing number, checking anagram validity, or finding the most frequent element.
4.  **Analyze Time/Space Trade-off:** Be prepared to explain why Counting Sort is O(n + k) and discuss when the space complexity O(k) is acceptable versus when it becomes prohibitive (e.g., if k is very large).
