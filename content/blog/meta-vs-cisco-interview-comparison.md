When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Meta and Cisco represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of software engineering interview preparation. Meta is known for its intense, high-volume algorithmic gauntlet, while Cisco's process is more moderate and focused on core problem-solving. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark contrast in scale. Meta's question bank is massive, with **1,387 questions** categorized by difficulty (414 Easy, 762 Medium, 211 Hard). This volume reflects the company's highly competitive hiring bar and the expectation that candidates will have practiced extensively across a wide range of problems. You must be prepared for a high probability of encountering a Medium or Hard problem during their coding rounds.

Cisco's question pool is significantly smaller, with **86 questions** total (22 Easy, 49 Medium, 15 Hard). This suggests a more predictable and focused interview process. The emphasis is clearly on Medium-difficulty questions, which form the majority of their catalog. While still challenging, the scope of preparation is more manageable.

**Key Takeaway:** Meta requires broad, deep preparation for high-difficulty problems. Cisco requires solid, focused preparation, primarily on Medium-level questions.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Meta's Additional Focus:** Meta explicitly lists **Math** as a top topic. This often involves number theory, combinatorics, or bit manipulation problems integrated into algorithmic challenges.
- **Cisco's Additional Focus:** Cisco lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic. This indicates a strong emphasis on efficient in-place array/string manipulation techniques, a classic pattern for Medium problems.

Here is a typical "Two Pointers" problem, highly relevant for Cisco and common at Meta:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your timeline and target companies.

**Prepare for Cisco first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or are prioritizing companies with a more focused technical screen. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and the Two Pointers pattern will build a strong foundation. Solving most of Cisco's Medium-difficulty questions is a realistic and excellent milestone that will directly benefit you for many other interviews.

**Prepare for Meta first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech companies or have an interview scheduled. Meta's preparation is exhaustive and will inherently cover the fundamentals needed for Cisco. If you can successfully tackle a large portion of Meta's Medium and Hard problems, you will be over-prepared for the technical depth required at Cisco. However, this path requires a significant time investment.

**The Efficient Strategy:** A hybrid approach is often best. Start by solidifying the **shared fundamentals** (Array, String, Hash Table). Then, integrate **Cisco's focus** (Two Pointers practice) and **Meta's focus** (Math problems) into your study plan. This builds a versatile skill set. Ultimately, prioritize the company you are interviewing with sooner.
