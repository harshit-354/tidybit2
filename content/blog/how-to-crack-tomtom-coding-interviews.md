TomTom’s coding interviews are designed to assess your problem-solving skills and your ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic challenges, often conducted via a collaborative coding platform. Success hinges on a solid grasp of core data structures and the ability to apply common patterns to practical problems.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, TomTom’s coding questions break down as follows: 25% Easy, 75% Medium, and 0% Hard. This distribution is crucial for your preparation strategy. The absence of Hard problems means you can focus your energy on mastering fundamental and intermediate concepts rather than esoteric, ultra-complex algorithms. However, the 75% Medium weighting is significant—it indicates they expect you to reliably solve problems that require combining multiple concepts or applying a known pattern with a non-obvious twist. You must be proficient, not just familiar.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, String, and Stack. Here’s what to know for each:

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect questions on traversal, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums. Master in-place operations and sliding windows.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A key differentiator for Medium problems. Focus on classic one-dimensional and two-dimensional DP patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and counting ways. Recognizing when a problem has overlapping subproblems is the core skill.
- **Greedy:** Often tested for optimization problems (e.g., scheduling, coin change where greedy works). The challenge is proving—or at least arguing—the correctness of your greedy choice.
- **String:** Closely tied to Array techniques. Practice anagrams, palindromes, and string matching. Know how to efficiently build and manipulate strings.
- **Stack:** Essential for problems involving nested structures, parsing, and next-greater-element patterns. It’s frequently the optimal solution for "matching" or "canceling out" adjacent elements.

Given that Dynamic Programming is both high-frequency and high-weight in Medium problems, understanding a core pattern like the "0/1 Knapsack" is essential. Here is a standard implementation for finding the maximum value achievable with a weight limit.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example usage
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i-1] <= w) {
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused 5-week plan.

- **Week 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Strings, and Stack. Solve 15-20 problems on these topics, focusing on pattern recognition. Implement each solution from scratch.
- **Week 3: Master Dynamic Programming.** This is your most important week. Start with 1D DP (Fibonacci, climbing stairs), then move to 2D (knapsack, LCS). Solve at least 15 classic DP problems. Write out the recurrence relation before coding.
- **Week 4: Greedy & Mixed Practice.** Study canonical greedy problems (activity selection, coin change where applicable). Then, start solving random Medium problems from all five key topics without knowing the category in advance.
- **Week 5: Mock Interviews & Review.** Simulate the actual interview environment. Use a timer and a voice call (or record yourself) to explain your thought process aloud. Revisit and re-solve problems you initially found difficult.
- **Ongoing:** Throughout all weeks, dedicate 20-30 minutes daily to reviewing time/space complexity analysis. Be prepared to discuss the Big O of every solution you write.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Start by restating the problem in your own words. Verbalize your initial thoughts, consider edge cases aloud, and explain your chosen algorithm before writing a single line of code. Interviewers assess your communication as much as your code.
2.  **Optimize Iteratively.** First, present a brute-force solution and state its complexity. Then, logically work towards the optimal solution. This demonstrates structured problem-solving even if you don't immediately recall the perfect pattern.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your code finished, walk through a few test cases: empty input, single element, large values, and the examples provided. This shows attention to detail and robustness.
4.  **Write Clean, Compilable Code.** Use consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and avoid overly clever one-liners. Write code as if it will be merged into a codebase. Include necessary imports/headers.

Your goal is to demonstrate consistent, reliable skill on Medium-difficulty problems across these five core areas. Focus your practice there, and you'll be well-prepared for the TomTom interview.
