Reddit’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving and coding skills, often mirroring the collaborative and scalable thinking needed for a platform of its size. Expect a mix of algorithmic questions, system design discussions, and behavioral rounds. The coding portion typically involves solving 1-2 problems in a 45-60 minute session, focusing on clean code, correct logic, and efficient communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Reddit coding questions reveals a clear distribution: approximately 20% Easy, 60% Medium, and 20% Hard problems. This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy. The high concentration of Medium questions means your primary goal is to achieve consistent, bug-free mastery over common patterns—these problems are the gatekeepers. The single Hard question often serves as a tiebreaker for top candidates, testing depth of algorithmic insight under pressure. Don’t neglect Easy problems; they are often used to quickly filter candidates on fundamental correctness and clarity. Your success hinges on dominating the Medium tier.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Hash Table, Math, Enumeration, String, and Breadth-First Search. Mastering these areas will cover the vast majority of problems you’ll encounter.

- **Hash Table:** The most common data structure, used for O(1) lookups to optimize solutions. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or mapping relationships.
- **Math:** Often involves number theory, modular arithmetic, or clever computations. Reddit problems may use math to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) or O(1).
- **Enumeration:** Systematically generating or iterating through all possible candidates for a solution. Frequently paired with pruning or hashing to avoid brute-force inefficiency.
- **String:** Manipulation, parsing, and pattern matching are core to many real-world platform features. Expect operations like reversal, splitting, and substring validation.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Key for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal, or any scenario requiring exploring neighbors before moving deeper.

The Hash Table is arguably the most critical tool. The classic **Two-Sum** pattern—using a hash map to store seen numbers for instant complement lookup—exemplifies its power.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage:
# print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}

// Example usage:
// int[] result = new Solution().twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9);
// System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured, topic-focused plan is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. Solve 5-8 problems per topic, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern (e.g., for Hash Table, practice Two-Sum, Group Anagrams, and First Missing Positive variations).
- **Weeks 3-4: Integration and Speed.** Practice mixed Medium problems without knowing the topic in advance. Time yourself (30 minutes per problem). Begin incorporating one Hard problem every other day to stretch your analytical skills. Use platforms that simulate the interview environment.
- **Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Review.** Complete at least 4-6 full mock interviews, ideally with a peer or mentor. Revisit all previously solved problems, especially those you struggled with. In the final days, focus on recall and verbalizing your thought process clearly.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** Always restate the problem in your own words, ask clarifying questions, and outline your approach (including time/space complexity) before writing a single line of code. Interviewers evaluate your process as much as your output.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** Start with a brute-force solution if necessary, but immediately discuss its limitations. Then, methodically apply optimizations (often involving a Hash Table or BFS) and explain the trade-offs. This shows structured problem-solving.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring completion, verbally walk through small, large, empty, and negative input cases. This demonstrates attention to detail and often catches off-by-one errors.
4.  **Practice Writing on a Whiteboard or in a Plain Text Editor.** You likely won’t have IDE autocomplete. Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code under this constraint.

Success in Reddit’s interviews comes from pattern recognition, clear communication, and deliberate practice on their favored topics. Start with the fundamentals, build speed, and simulate the real environment.
