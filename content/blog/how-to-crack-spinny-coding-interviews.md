Spinny’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong foundational problem-solving skills, particularly in data manipulation and optimization. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic challenges, often drawn from common competitive programming domains. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of the specific patterns and topics Spinny favors.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Spinny's recent coding problems reveals a clear pattern: **100% of questions are rated at Medium difficulty**. There are no Easy or Hard problems in this dataset. This is a critical insight. It means Spinny is not testing basic syntax or obscure, complex algorithms. Instead, they are consistently evaluating a candidate's ability to solve non-trivial, practical problems that require combining multiple core concepts. You must demonstrate clean, efficient, and well-reasoned code under typical interview constraints. The absence of Hard problems suggests depth over extreme complexity—mastering advanced applications of fundamental topics is more valuable than studying highly esoteric algorithms.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of topics. Master these, and you'll be prepared for the vast majority of challenges.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving in-place transformations, subarray calculations, and multi-pass logic.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Crucial for solving problems related to frequency counting, pair finding, and state tracking.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for other algorithms like two-pointer or binary search. Understanding the properties of a sorted array is key.
- **Binary Search:** Not just for searching in sorted arrays. Essential for solving optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum possible maximum") and searching in rotated arrays.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Used for problems with overlapping subproblems, like classic optimization (knapsack), counting ways, or finding optimal sequences.

The most powerful combination from this list is **Hash Table + Array**. A quintessential pattern is using a hash map to store indices or counts to solve a problem in a single pass, such as the "Two Sum" problem or finding contiguous subarrays with a certain sum.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // No solution
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach is optimal given Spinny's concentrated question profile.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Topic Mastery**
Dedicate one day to each of the five core topics (Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Binary Search, DP). For each, study the fundamental patterns. For Arrays, practice two-pointer and sliding window. For DP, start with 1D problems like Fibonacci and climbing stairs before moving to 2D. Solve 5-7 Medium problems per topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Hybrid Problems**
Spinny's Medium problems often combine topics. Practice problems that mix these areas: Binary Search on a transformed array, using a Hash Table to optimize a DP state, or Sorting as a pre-processing step for a greedy array solution. Solve 3-5 integrated problems daily.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Weakness Drilling**
Simulate the real interview environment. Do timed 45-60 minute sessions with a mix of problems, focusing on clear communication and edge case handling. Use your performance to identify weak spots (e.g., "I struggle with non-standard Binary Search applications") and dedicate the next day to drilling that specific sub-topic intensely.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First for Time, Then for Space.** A correct O(n log n) solution is almost always better than an incomplete O(n) solution. For Medium problems, get a working solution first, then discuss optimization. The hash table pattern shown above is a classic example of trading space for a major time optimization.
2.  **Explain the "Why" Behind Your Data Structure Choice.** Don't just implement a hash map; state, "I'll use a hash map to store seen values because it gives us O(1) lookups, which allows us to solve this in a single pass." This demonstrates deeper understanding.
3.  **Practice Writing Code on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** You likely won't have IDE auto-completion. Being fluent in writing syntactically correct code without aids is a must.
4.  **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases Immediately.** Before coding, ask: "Can the array be empty? Are the numbers all integers? What should be returned if there's no solution?" This shows systematic thinking.

The path to cracking Spinny's coding interviews is one of focused depth on Medium-difficulty problems that blend Array, Hash Table, and other core algorithms. Master the patterns, not just the problems.
