Harness is a modern software delivery platform that automates CI/CD, feature flags, and cloud cost management. Their engineering interviews reflect this focus on building reliable, high-performance systems. The coding round typically involves solving 2-3 algorithmic problems in a 60-90 minute session, often conducted on a platform like HackerRank or CodeSignal. The problems are designed to assess not just your ability to write correct code, but your problem-solving process, communication, and efficiency under constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Harness coding questions reveals a distinct profile: 0% Easy, 33% Medium, and 67% Hard problems. This distribution is more challenging than the average tech company and sends a clear signal. Harness prioritizes candidates who can handle complex, multi-step algorithmic thinking. You are unlikely to see simple array traversals. Instead, expect problems that combine several concepts, require optimization, and have non-obvious edge cases. The high percentage of Hard problems means you must be comfortable moving beyond textbook examples to tackle questions that feel novel under interview pressure. Success hinges on deep pattern recognition and robust implementation.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a clear cluster of high-frequency topics. Mastering these is non-negotiable.

- **Array & Hash Table:** The foundational duo. Arrays are the default data structure, and Hash Tables (dictionaries/maps) are the most common tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize brute-force solutions. Think: "Can I use a map to store what I've seen?"
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems, requiring manipulation, parsing, or comparison. Common patterns include palindrome checks, anagram grouping, and substring searches.
- **Sliding Window:** The premier technique for optimizing problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. It's essential for moving from O(n²) to O(n) complexity when a problem asks for "the longest substring with K distinct characters" or "the minimum subarray sum ≥ target."
- **Two Pointers:** A versatile pattern for iterating through arrays or strings with two indices. It's crucial for sorted array problems (like two-sum), in-place manipulations (like removing duplicates), or working from both ends inward.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is particularly critical given its prevalence in string and array-based "Hard" problems. Here is a template for the variable-length window, which you should internalize.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def sliding_window_template(s, target):
    left = 0
    window_map = {}
    result = 0  # or float('inf') for min problems

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # 1. Expand window: Add s[right] to window state
        window_map[s[right]] = window_map.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # 2. Check condition: Shrink window until it's valid again
        while condition_to_shrink(window_map, target):
            # 3. Update result (may happen before or after shrinking)
            result = update_result(result, right - left + 1)

            # Remove s[left] from window state
            window_map[s[left]] -= 1
            if window_map[s[left]] == 0:
                del window_map[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # 4. Update result for valid windows (alternative location)
        result = update_result(result, right - left + 1)
    return result
```

```javascript
function slidingWindowTemplate(s, target) {
  let left = 0;
  const windowMap = new Map();
  let result = 0; // or Infinity for min problems

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // 1. Expand window
    const char = s[right];
    windowMap.set(char, (windowMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);

    // 2. Condition to shrink
    while (conditionToShrink(windowMap, target)) {
      // 3. Update result
      result = updateResult(result, right - left + 1);

      // Remove s[left]
      const leftChar = s[left];
      windowMap.set(leftChar, windowMap.get(leftChar) - 1);
      if (windowMap.get(leftChar) === 0) {
        windowMap.delete(leftChar);
      }
      left++;
    }
    // 4. Update result
    result = updateResult(result, right - left + 1);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public int slidingWindowTemplate(String s, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    Map<Character, Integer> windowMap = new HashMap<>();
    int result = 0; // or Integer.MAX_VALUE

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // 1. Expand window
        char rChar = s.charAt(right);
        windowMap.put(rChar, windowMap.getOrDefault(rChar, 0) + 1);

        // 2. Condition to shrink
        while (conditionToShrink(windowMap, target)) {
            // 3. Update result
            result = updateResult(result, right - left + 1);

            // Remove s[left]
            char lChar = s.charAt(left);
            windowMap.put(lChar, windowMap.get(lChar) - 1);
            if (windowMap.get(lChar) == 0) {
                windowMap.remove(lChar);
            }
            left++;
        }
        // 4. Update result
        result = updateResult(result, right - left + 1);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the difficulty curve, a superficial review won't suffice. Follow this phased plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition.** Ignore company-specific problems. Use a platform like TidyBit to solve 80-100 problems focused exclusively on the top topics: Array, Hash Table, String, Sliding Window, and Two Pointers. For each problem, after solving, categorize it by its core pattern. The goal is to build a mental library where you see a new problem and think "this is a variation of a sliding window with a hash map counter."

**Weeks 3-4: Depth on Hard Problems.** Shift your focus. Dedicate 70% of your practice time to Medium-Hard and Hard problems from the core topics. Struggle through them for up to 45 minutes before checking solutions. Then, re-implement them from scratch 24 hours later. This builds the stamina and analytical depth required for Harness's interview.

**Weeks 5-6: Harness-Specific Simulation.** In the final stretch, seek out and solve every Harness-labeled problem you can find. Simulate the actual interview: set a 75-minute timer for 2-3 problems of mixed Medium/Hard difficulty. Practice verbalizing your thought process out loud as you solve. This conditions you to the unique pressure and style of their assessment.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** From the moment you read the problem, talk. Explain your initial thoughts, discuss brute-force approaches and their complexity, then propose optimizations. A silent screen is a red flag. They are evaluating your collaborative problem-solving.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First.** With Hard problems, the optimal solution may not be immediately apparent. Clearly state you will implement a working, brute-force or sub-optimal solution first. Then, iterate and optimize. A correct, slower solution is better than a buggy, "optimal" one.
3.  **Test Aggressively with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your code complete, walk through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicates. Write these down at the start and mentally execute your logic against them. This demonstrates the thoroughness needed to build reliable systems at Harness.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Never assume. For a problem about strings, ask: "Is the character set ASCII or Unicode?" "Can the input be null?" This shows attention to detail and prevents you from solving the wrong problem.

Your goal is to demonstrate you can architect solutions to complex, ambiguous problems—a daily task for engineers at Harness. Target your preparation on depth over breadth, master the sliding window and two-pointer patterns, and practice under realistic conditions.
