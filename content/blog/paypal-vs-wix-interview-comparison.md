When preparing for technical interviews at PayPal and Wix, you'll find both similarities and distinct differences in their question profiles. PayPal, a global payments giant, presents a larger, more challenging dataset, while Wix, a website creation platform, offers a smaller, moderately difficult set. Your preparation strategy should be tailored to the specific company's focus, but understanding the core overlap can make studying for both more efficient.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

PayPal's interview process is known for its rigor, reflected in its dataset of **106 questions**. The difficulty distribution (Easy: 18, Medium: 69, Hard: 19) highlights a strong emphasis on **Medium-level problems**, which form the core of their technical screens. This volume suggests a broad and deep assessment of algorithmic problem-solving skills, where candidates are expected to handle complex logic and optimization under pressure.

Wix, in contrast, has a more focused dataset of **56 questions**, which is roughly half the size of PayPal's. Its distribution (Easy: 16, Medium: 31, Hard: 9) also centers on Medium problems but with a noticeably lower proportion of Hard questions. This indicates a slightly less intense difficulty curve, though candidates should not underestimate the challenge posed by their Medium-tier questions, which are the primary hurdle.

The key takeaway: Preparing for PayPal will inherently cover the depth required for Wix, but not necessarily the reverse due to the disparity in volume and high-difficulty focus.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The **core shared topics** are:

- **Array & String Manipulation:** Problems involving traversal, slicing, and in-place operations.
- **Hash Table Usage:** For efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving two-sum variants.

**PayPal's additional focus** is on **Sorting** algorithms and related techniques (e.g., custom comparators, merge intervals). This aligns with backend systems that process and reconcile financial transactions.

**Wix's distinctive focus** is on **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, often applied to tree and graph structures. This is highly relevant for a platform that manages hierarchical website components, DOM trees, or navigation structures.

Here is a typical problem for each company's unique focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# PayPal-style: Sorting Focus (e.g., Merge Intervals)
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
// PayPal-style: Sorting Focus (e.g., Merge Intervals)
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// PayPal-style: Sorting Focus (e.g., Merge Intervals)
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

</div>

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Wix-style: DFS Focus (e.g., Tree Path Sum)
def has_path_sum(root, target_sum):
    if not root:
        return False
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return target_sum == root.val
    remaining = target_sum - root.val
    return (has_path_sum(root.left, remaining) or
            has_path_sum(root.right, remaining))
```

```javascript
// Wix-style: DFS Focus (e.g., Tree Path Sum)
function hasPathSum(root, targetSum) {
  if (!root) return false;
  if (!root.left && !root.right) {
    return targetSum === root.val;
  }
  const remaining = targetSum - root.val;
  return hasPathSum(root.left, remaining) || hasPathSum(root.right, remaining);
}
```

```java
// Wix-style: DFS Focus (e.g., Tree Path Sum)
public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
    if (root == null) return false;
    if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
        return targetSum == root.val;
    }
    int remaining = targetSum - root.val;
    return hasPathSum(root.left, remaining) || hasPathSum(root.right, remaining);
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

**Prepare for PayPal first if you are interviewing at both companies or aiming for a more challenging general interview practice.** Mastering PayPal's larger set of Medium and Hard problems, especially in Sorting, will build a strong foundation that makes Wix's dataset feel more manageable. The core Array, String, and Hash Table practice will directly transfer.

**Prepare for Wix first if it is your primary target.** You can efficiently focus on the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and then dedicate specific time to mastering Depth-First Search patterns on trees and graphs. This focused approach is effective given the smaller question bank.

Ultimately, the shared emphasis on fundamental data structures means a strong core preparation serves you for both. Prioritize the company you are interviewing with first, using its unique focus (Sorting for PayPal, DFS for Wix) to guide your deep-dive topics.
