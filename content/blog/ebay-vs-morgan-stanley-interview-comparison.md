When preparing for technical interviews at top companies, understanding their specific question patterns can dramatically increase your efficiency. eBay and Morgan Stanley, while both prestigious, have distinct technical screening focuses rooted in their core business models—eCommerce vs. high-stakes finance. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

eBay's question pool is slightly larger and more challenging overall. With 60 total questions categorized as 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard, the distribution shows a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. This suggests their interviews are designed to thoroughly assess core problem-solving skills under typical interview constraints. The presence of 10 Hard questions indicates you may encounter at least one complex problem requiring optimized, non-trivial solutions.

Morgan Stanley's set is marginally smaller at 53 questions, with a distribution of 13 Easy, 34 Medium, and 6 Hard. The profile is similar but slightly less daunting, with a greater proportion of Easy questions and fewer Hard ones. This reflects a focus on assessing solid fundamentals and reliable coding ability, though the Medium-heavy core means you cannot afford to be weak on standard algorithms. The lower count of Hard questions suggests depth in a few areas rather than breadth of extreme complexity.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the absolute core for both eBay and Morgan Stanley. Mastering these is non-negotiable.

- **Array/String Manipulation:** Expect questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and string parsing.
- **Hash Table Usage:** Frequently used for frequency counting, lookups, and as a supporting data structure to achieve O(1) or O(n) time complexity.

The key differentiator is the fourth major topic.

- **eBay** emphasizes **Sorting**. This goes beyond calling a library `sort()` function. You must understand sorting algorithms (like quicksort or mergesort) conceptually and, more importantly, master problems where sorting is the key insight—such as meeting intervals, reconstructing queues, or finding the Kth largest element.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Meeting Intervals (often involves sorting)
def canAttendMeetings(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: Meeting Intervals
function canAttendMeetings(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: Meeting Intervals
public boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

- **Morgan Stanley** places a significant focus on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with the quantitative and optimization-heavy nature of finance. You must be prepared for classical DP problems (knapsack, coin change, longest common subsequence) as well as applied problems on arrays and strings.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Classic DP - Coin Change
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example: Classic DP - Coin Change
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  let dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let coin of coins) {
    for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example: Classic DP - Coin Change
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Morgan Stanley**. Its focus is narrower, with a clear emphasis on the three universal basics plus Dynamic Programming. Building deep proficiency in DP will make you a stronger candidate for both companies, as DP questions can appear anywhere. Mastering the Morgan Stanley pattern ensures you have a very strong foundation in the most challenging core topic (DP) and the absolute essentials.

Then, pivot to **eBay**. This transition requires adding depth in Sorting-based problem patterns and preparing for a slightly higher volume of Hard problems. Since you will already be proficient in Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and DP from your Morgan Stanley prep, you can efficiently target eBay's specific sorting-centric questions and tackle more complex problem variations.

Ultimately, preparing for Morgan Stanley builds a robust algorithmic foundation, while adapting for eBay requires extending that foundation into different problem-solving patterns.
