Dynamic Programming (DP) is a critical skill for software engineering roles at Cisco, especially for positions involving network optimization, resource allocation, and systems design. Cisco's interview process includes a significant focus on algorithmic problem-solving, with approximately 15% of their coding questions (13 out of 86) being DP problems. This emphasis exists because DP elegantly solves complex optimization problems—like finding the most efficient data path through a network or minimizing resource costs—which are core to Cisco's business in networking hardware and software. Mastering DP demonstrates your ability to break down intricate problems, recognize overlapping subproblems, and implement efficient, scalable solutions, a key competency for building high-performance systems.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Cisco's DP questions typically fall into a few common categories that mirror real-world engineering challenges. You can expect:

- **One-Dimensional DP:** Problems like "Climbing Stairs" or "House Robber," which model linear decision processes, such as sequential packet routing or simple cost accumulation.
- **Two-Dimensional DP:** This often involves string or grid-based problems, like "Longest Common Subsequence" or "Unique Paths." These are analogous to comparing network configuration states or navigating a grid of network nodes.
- **Knapsack/Subset Problems:** Problems involving selecting items with weights and values to maximize utility within a constraint, directly applicable to resource allocation in network bandwidth or hardware configuration.
- **Interval or State-Based DP:** Less frequent but possible, these involve problems like "Minimum Cost to Merge Stones" or complex state transitions.

The problems are designed to test your ability to move from a brute-force recursive understanding to an optimized, often iterative, DP solution.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by solidifying the core DP patterns. Memorizing solutions is ineffective; instead, internalize the process:

1.  **Identify the problem type:** Is it about sequences, grids, choices, or partitions?
2.  **Define the state:** What does `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` represent? (e.g., "the minimum cost up to step i").
3.  **Formulate the recurrence relation:** This is the key transition rule.
4.  **Determine base cases:** The simplest, smallest subproblems.
5.  **Choose an implementation order:** Top-down (memoized recursion) or bottom-up (iterative tabulation).

Practice explaining your reasoning aloud as you solve. For a foundational example, consider the **"Climbing Stairs"** problem, which uses the Fibonacci pattern.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    # dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1  # Base case: 1 way to reach step 1
    dp[2] = 2  # Base case: 2 ways to reach step 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Recurrence: Ways to reach i = ways to reach (i-1) + ways to reach (i-2)
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  // dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1; // Base case
  dp[2] = 2; // Base case
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    // Recurrence relation
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    // dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; // Base case
    dp[2] = 2; // Base case
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        // Recurrence relation
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Build your skills progressively. Do not jump into hard problems immediately.

1.  **Foundation:** Start with classical 1D problems: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber.
2.  **String & Grids:** Move to 2D DP: Longest Common Subsequence, Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum.
3.  **Knapsack Variants:** Practice 0/1 Knapsack, Partition Equal Subset Sum.
4.  **Cisco-Specific & Advanced:** Finally, tackle problems tagged for Cisco on platforms like TidyBit, and harder general DP problems (e.g., "Coin Change," "Word Break").

Consistent, pattern-focused practice is more valuable than volume. Solve each problem, then revisit it a day later to reinforce the recurrence relation in your mind.
