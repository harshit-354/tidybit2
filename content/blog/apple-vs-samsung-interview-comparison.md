When preparing for technical interviews at Apple and Samsung, understanding their question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Both companies test core computer science fundamentals, but their approach, volume, and emphasis differ significantly. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of available questions. Apple's list, with 356 questions, is over five times larger than Samsung's 69. This reflects Apple's longer history of documented interviews and a broader range of roles.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** The majority of questions are Medium (206), with a substantial number of Easy (100) and a smaller, challenging set of Hard (50). This suggests a balanced interview that tests foundational skills and problem-solving, with hard questions likely used for senior roles or specific teams.
- **Samsung (E15/M37/H17):** The distribution is more concentrated in Medium (37) and Hard (17) relative to its total. The proportion of Hard questions is higher (~25% vs ~14% for Apple), indicating Samsung's process may lean slightly more toward complex problem-solving, even at the general level.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, making these critical areas to master. **Hash Table** is also a shared, high-utility topic for optimizing solutions.

The key differentiator is in secondary focus:

- **Apple** shows a strong emphasis on **String** manipulation problems. This aligns with domains involving user interfaces, text processing, and system-level software.
- **Samsung** places notable importance on the **Two Pointers** technique. This is a common pattern for solving problems involving sorted arrays, linked lists, or sliding windows, often related to optimization and efficient traversal.

Here is a typical Two Pointers problem, more common at Samsung, solved in three languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

In contrast, a common String-focused problem for Apple might involve checking for palindromes or substring manipulations.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by the breadth of topics and your target company.

1.  **Start with the Shared Core:** Begin by mastering **Array, Dynamic Programming, and Hash Table** problems. This foundation will serve you for both companies. Practice a mix of Easy and Medium problems to build fluency.
2.  **If targeting Apple:** After the core, dedicate significant time to **String** problems. The larger question bank means you should practice more problems overall to build pattern recognition. Don't neglect the suite of Hard questions, especially if interviewing for a senior position.
3.  **If targeting Samsung:** After the core, deeply practice the **Two Pointers** technique and its variations (like sliding window). While the question list is smaller, the higher proportion of Medium and Hard questions means you should focus on solving each problem thoroughly and understanding optimal solutions.

A strategic approach is to prepare for Samsung first if you have interviews at both. Its focused list allows you to build deep competency in a smaller set of patterns, which you can then expand upon with Apple's broader, String-heavy question bank.
