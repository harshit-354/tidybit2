Toast’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills relevant to building and scaling their restaurant management platform. Candidates can typically expect a mix of algorithmic questions, system design discussions, and behavioral rounds. The coding portion is often the first major hurdle, and its composition reveals a clear, strategic path for preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear emphasis on foundational problem-solving: 67% of questions are rated Easy, 33% are Medium, and Hard problems are absent. This distribution is telling. Toast isn't primarily looking for algorithmic virtuosos who can solve obscure graph theory puzzles under extreme time pressure. Instead, they are evaluating a candidate's ability to write clean, efficient, and correct code for problems that mirror real-world data manipulation tasks—like processing transaction arrays, validating input strings, or optimizing simple operational logic. The absence of Hard questions means your study time is best spent mastering core concepts and execution speed on common patterns, rather than diving into advanced, niche algorithms.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics—Array, String, Dynamic Programming, Two Pointers, and Greedy—form the essential toolkit for Toast's domain.

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock. Expect problems involving traversal, searching, sorting, and in-place modification. Mastery here is non-negotiable.
- **Dynamic Programming:** While not the most frequent, its presence signals Toast's interest in optimization problems, likely related to resource allocation or cost calculation scenarios.
- **Two Pointers:** A crucial technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings with optimal space, such as finding pairs or removing duplicates.
- **Greedy:** Useful for problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global solution, often applied in scheduling or interval-based questions.

The **Two Pointers** technique is particularly powerful and common. Here’s a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach will yield the best results given Toast's question profile.

- **Weeks 1-2: Core Foundations.** Dedicate this time exclusively to **Array** and **String** problems. Solve at least 15-20 problems from each category, focusing on different patterns like sliding window, prefix sum, and hash map usage. The goal is to make traversal and manipulation second nature.
- **Weeks 3-4: Essential Patterns.** Move on to **Two Pointers** and **Greedy** algorithms. Solve another 10-15 problems for each. Then, introduce **Dynamic Programming**. Start with the fundamentals—Fibonacci, climbing stairs, 0/1 knapsack—before attempting more complex variations. Don't skip DP; understanding the concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure is key.
- **Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new topics. Use this phase for mixed practice sessions. Simulate the actual interview: set a 45-minute timer and solve 2 problems—one Easy, one Medium. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly, writing syntactically perfect code on the first try, and thoroughly testing with edge cases (empty arrays, single elements, large inputs).

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Clean Code Over Cleverness.** Given the high percentage of Easy/Medium questions, a straightforward, readable solution is often better than a convoluted, one-line trick. Use descriptive variable names, write helper functions when logic repeats, and comment briefly on complex steps.
2.  **Always Validate Input.** Before diving into logic, check for edge cases: null/empty inputs, single-element arrays, or strings with all the same character. Stating this upfront shows production-level coding awareness.
3.  **Practice Verbalizing Your Thought Process.** In the interview, you are being evaluated on how you think, not just the final answer. Narrate your approach, discuss trade-offs between different solutions (e.g., "We could use a hash map for O(n) time but O(n) space, or sort first for O(n log n) time and O(1) space"), and then implement the chosen one.
4.  **Master In-Place Operations.** Many Array and String problems for Toast will emphasize space efficiency. Be extremely comfortable with techniques like the two-pointer swap or overwrite shown above, as they are common in real-world systems where data volume is large.

Success in Toast interviews hinges on consistent, precise execution of standard algorithms. Build fluency in the core topics, and you'll be able to handle the majority of their technical screeners.
