Autodesk’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving and software engineering fundamentals. The process typically involves one or two technical phone screens focusing on data structures and algorithms, followed by a virtual onsite with similar rounds, sometimes including system design for more senior roles. The questions are practical, often mirroring real-world data processing or optimization problems relevant to their software domains. Success hinges on methodical preparation and pattern recognition.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing a dataset of 34 Autodesk coding questions reveals a clear profile: **21% Easy, 59% Medium, and 21% Hard**. This distribution is critical for planning. The overwhelming majority (80%) of your interview will be fought on Medium terrain. This means you must achieve fluency with core data structures and common algorithmic patterns—not just familiarity. The Hard questions exist to stratify top candidates, but you cannot reach them without first mastering the Medium core. The 21% Easy questions are your warm-up; they ensure you have zero gaps in the basics. Your study plan should reflect this: dedicate approximately 60% of your coding practice to Medium problems, 20% to Easy for speed and confidence, and 20% to Hard for stretching your analytical limits.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a strong emphasis on foundational, data-centric topics. Mastering these five areas is non-negotiable.

- **Array (Top Topic):** The fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place manipulation, and subarray problems.
- **Hash Table:** The quintessential tool for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, deduplication, and complement searching (like Two Sum).
- **String:** Closely related to array problems. Focus on palindrome checks, anagram grouping, and substring searches.
- **Sorting:** Rarely an end in itself, but a crucial preprocessing step for many efficient solutions (e.g., Two Pointer techniques).
- **Binary Search:** Applied not just on sorted arrays, but on answer spaces for optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum capacity to ship within D days").

For Autodesk, a dominant pattern across Array and String topics is the **Two Pointer** technique, especially for in-place operations or searching in sorted data. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # `write` pointer marks the position of the last unique element.
    write = 0
    # `read` pointer explores the array.
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[write]:
            write += 1
            nums[write] = nums[read]
    # The new length is the index of the last unique element + 1.
    return write + 1
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 0;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[write]) {
      write++;
      nums[write] = nums[read];
    }
  }
  return write + 1;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 0;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[write]) {
            write++;
            nums[write] = nums[read];
        }
    }
    return write + 1;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: **Foundation Build.** Systematically review core data structures: Array, String, Hash Table, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph. Implement them from scratch. Solve 1-2 Easy problems per topic to build muscle memory.

Weeks 3-4: **Pattern Immersion.** This is the core of your preparation. Dedicate each day to a key algorithmic pattern, prioritizing those relevant to Autodesk's top topics:

- Two Pointers (Sliding Window, Left/Right)
- Hash Table for frequency & complement
- Binary Search (standard and applied)
- Depth-First Search / Breadth-First Search
- Dynamic Programming (for 1D and 2D problems)
  Solve 3-5 Medium problems for each pattern. Do not memorize solutions—memorize the approach.

Weeks 5-6: **Integration and Simulation.** Start mixing topics. Practice solving 2-3 Medium problems in a 45-minute block to simulate interview timing. In the final week, complete several full mock interviews (use platforms like TidyBit or with a peer). Revisit your mistakes from previous weeks.

Allocate 1-2 hours daily for consistent, focused practice. Quality of practice—where you deeply analyze your solution's time/space complexity and edge cases—beats sheer volume.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a single line of code, state the problem in your own words, confirm constraints, and verbally outline your approach, including time/space complexity. Interviewers assess your thought process more than your first draft code.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** It's often effective to start with a brute-force solution, then optimize. Say, "A naive approach would be O(n²). We can improve this to O(n log n) with sorting, or to O(n) with a hash map." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** After coding, don't wait for the interviewer to ask. Walk through test cases: empty input, single element, large values, sorted/reversed input. This proves you are a thorough engineer.
4.  **Know Your Languages.** Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs of your implementation choices (e.g., using a HashMap in Java vs. a dictionary in Python) at a basic level. Use the language you are most fluent in.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Is the array sorted? Can it contain negatives? What should be returned for invalid input? These questions directly shape your algorithm and show attention to detail.

The path to cracking Autodesk's interview is a focused grind on Medium-difficulty problems involving arrays, hash tables, and strings. Build your pattern recognition, communicate your logic, and practice under time constraints.
