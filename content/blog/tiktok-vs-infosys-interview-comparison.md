When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. TikTok and Infosys represent two distinct ends of the tech industry spectrum—a fast-moving social media giant and a global IT services and consulting leader. Their interview question banks reflect these different operational models and hiring needs. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the scale of their respective question pools. TikTok's list, at 383 questions, is more than double Infosys's 158. This larger volume suggests a broader range of potential problems and a greater emphasis on algorithmic depth and variety.

Looking at the difficulty breakdown reveals further nuance:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty, which comprises about 68% of its questions. This is typical for competitive tech companies, where interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving and coding skills under pressure. The significant portion of Hard questions (21%) indicates they frequently probe advanced algorithmic understanding.
- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** While also starting with 42 Easy questions, the proportion shifts. Medium questions make up about 52% of the total, and Hard questions about 22%. The overall smaller pool with a slightly higher _relative_ percentage of Hard questions might suggest a focus on a core set of challenging, classic problems rather than a wide array of novel ones.

**Key Takeaway:** TikTok's interview process likely involves encountering a wider variety of medium-to-hard problems testing adaptability. Infosys's process may drill deeper into a more concentrated set of fundamental but challenging concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize three core technical areas: **Array, String, and Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This strong overlap means mastering these topics is universally beneficial.

- **Arrays & Strings:** These are foundational data structures for coding interviews. Questions test manipulation, searching, sorting, and implementing algorithms on sequential data.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical topic for optimizing solutions to problems with overlapping subproblems. Mastery here is non-negotiable for both.

The primary difference in stated topics is TikTok's inclusion of **Hash Table** as a top focus, while Infosys lists **Math**. In practice, Hash Tables are ubiquitous for achieving efficient lookups and are essential for solving countless array and string problems. Math problems often involve number theory, combinatorics, or bit manipulation.

```python
# Example: A problem combining Hash Table (for count) and Array.
def findMajorityElement(nums):
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
        if count[num] > len(nums) // 2:
            return num
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table (for count) and Array.
function findMajorityElement(nums) {
  const count = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    const currentCount = (count.get(num) || 0) + 1;
    count.set(num, currentCount);
    if (currentCount > nums.length / 2) {
      return num;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table (for count) and Array.
public int findMajorityElement(int[] nums) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        int currentCount = count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1;
        count.put(num, currentCount);
        if (currentCount > nums.length / 2) {
            return num;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Preparing for TikTok will inherently cover Infosys's core needs (Array, String, DP). You must ensure your Hash Table skills are excellent. For Infosys, be ready to apply core algorithms within mathematical contexts.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target role and the transferability of skills.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are new to technical interviews or are specifically targeting IT services, consulting, or system integration roles. The smaller, focused question set allows you to build deep competency in the absolute essentials (Array, String, DP, Math). Success here creates a solid foundation of problem-solving patterns.

**Prepare for TikTok first if:** You are aiming for product-based or FAANG-level companies, or if you have more time to prepare. Tackling TikTok's larger volume of primarily Medium-difficulty questions will force you to become adaptable and fast. The skills developed—especially in efficiently using Hash Tables and solving complex DP problems—are highly transferable and will make the Infosys question set feel like a focused subset.

A strategic hybrid approach is effective: Use the **common core topics (Array, String, Dynamic Programming)** as your anchor. Solve a mix of Medium problems from both lists in these areas. Then, branch out to master Hash Table patterns (for TikTok depth) and classic mathematical algorithms (for Infosys).
