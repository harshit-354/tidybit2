Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a non-negotiable algorithm for technical interviews. Its core principle—exploring a graph or tree level by level—makes it the definitive tool for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and for any problem requiring layered, step-by-step exploration. If your problem involves "minimum steps," "level order," or "nearest distance," BFS is likely your starting point. Mastering its patterns is essential because interviewers use it to test your understanding of graph traversal, queue operations, and systematic problem-solving.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing these patterns will let you map interview questions directly to a BFS implementation.

### 1. Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph

This is the classic use case. BFS guarantees the shortest number of steps or edges from a starting node to a target when all edges have equal weight. The queue ensures you process all nodes at distance `k` before any at distance `k+1`.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, target):
    if start == target:
        return 0
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    distance = 0

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node == target:
                return distance
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        distance += 1
    return -1  # Target not reachable
```

```javascript
function shortestPathBFS(graph, start, target) {
  if (start === target) return 0;
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set([start]);
  let distance = 0;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      if (node === target) return distance;
      for (const neighbor of graph[node] || []) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          visited.add(neighbor);
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
    distance++;
  }
  return -1; // Target not reachable
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public int shortestPathBFS(List<List<Integer>> graph, int start, int target) {
    if (start == target) return 0;
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[graph.size()];
    queue.offer(start);
    visited[start] = true;
    int distance = 0;

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int levelSize = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            if (node == target) return distance;
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        distance++;
    }
    return -1; // Target not reachable
}
```

### 2. Level Order Traversal (Tree or Graph)

BFS naturally processes nodes level by level. This pattern is directly used in binary tree level order traversal and any scenario where you need to group nodes by their distance from the root.

### 3. Multi-Source BFS

Instead of starting BFS from a single node, you initialize the queue with multiple sources. This efficiently finds the shortest distance from any source to a target, common in problems like "rotting oranges" or "walls and gates."

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def multi_source_bfs(grid, sources):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque(sources)  # Each source as (r, c)
    visited = set(sources)
    distance = 0

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        for _ in range(level_size):
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            # Process cell (r, c)
            for dr, dc in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nr, nc))
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        distance += 1
```

```javascript
function multiSourceBFS(grid, sources) {
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  const queue = [...sources]; // Each source as [r, c]
  const visited = new Set(sources.map((s) => `${s[0]},${s[1]}`));
  let distance = 0;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const [r, c] = queue.shift();
      // Process cell (r, c)
      const directions = [
        [0, 1],
        [1, 0],
        [0, -1],
        [-1, 0],
      ];
      for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
        const nr = r + dr,
          nc = c + dc;
        const key = `${nr},${nc}`;
        if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.has(key)) {
          visited.add(key);
          queue.push([nr, nc]);
        }
      }
    }
    distance++;
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public void multiSourceBFS(int[][] grid, List<int[]> sources) {
    int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>(sources);
    boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
    for (int[] src : sources) visited[src[0]][src[1]] = true;
    int distance = 0;

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int levelSize = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];
            // Process cell (r, c)
            int[][] directions = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                    visited[nr][nc] = true;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                }
            }
        }
        distance++;
    }
}
```

### 4. BFS on Implicit Graphs

The "graph" isn't always given as an adjacency list. The state space itself can be the graph, where each state is a node and transitions are edges. Problems like "word ladder" or "sliding puzzle" require you to generate neighboring states on the fly during BFS.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data on 199 questions shows a clear distribution: **Easy (19, 10%), Medium (122, 61%), Hard (58, 29%)**. This split is instructive.

The **Medium majority** indicates that BFS is rarely asked in isolation. An "Easy" question might be a straightforward level-order traversal. A **Medium** problem typically layers BFS with another concept: a matrix transformation, a state search, or a more complex visited state. The **Hard** problems often combine BFS with advanced data structures (like bidirectional BFS with a Trie), complex state representation, or require significant optimization to avoid timeouts. The distribution means you must be comfortable using BFS as a foundational step within a more complex solution.

## Which Companies Ask Breadth-First Search

BFS is a staple at companies that emphasize core algorithms and large-scale systems, where graph traversal is fundamental.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks BFS for problems involving network crawling, shortest path in grids, and state-space search.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) commonly use it in questions related to tree serialization, level-order operations, and puzzle-solving.
- [Meta](/company/meta) leverages BFS for social network-style problems (degree of separation, friend suggestions) and matrix traversal.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) often includes BFS in financial data processing and network analysis questions.

## Study Tips

1.  **Implement the Skeleton from Memory.** You should be able to write the BFS boilerplate—queue, visited set, level loop—in under a minute in your chosen language. This saves crucial time.
2.  **Practice State Representation.** For implicit graph problems, the key is cleanly defining a node. It could be a string, a tuple of coordinates, or a bitmask. Practice converting a problem's state into a hashable key for your visited set.
3.  **Identify the "Level."** Always ask: what constitutes one step? Your queue will hold all elements that are _one step away_ from being processed. Properly managing the queue and the level counter is critical for shortest-path answers.
4.  **Combine with Other Algorithms.** Be ready to use BFS as a component. For example, you might use BFS to find distances, then apply dynamic programming, or use BFS to build a graph for a later algorithm.

Master these patterns and you'll turn a broad graph exploration into a targeted interview strategy.
