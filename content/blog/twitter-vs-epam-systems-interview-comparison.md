When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of your target company can dramatically improve your efficiency. A comparison of Twitter (now X) and EPAM Systems reveals distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics, guiding your study priorities.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions is similar for both companies, but the distribution of difficulty tells a very different story.

**Twitter's** 53 questions are heavily weighted towards challenging problems, with 12 Hard (H12) and 33 Medium (M33) questions. Only 8 are marked as Easy (E8). This profile is typical of major product-based tech firms, where interviews are designed to rigorously assess complex problem-solving and system design skills, especially for senior levels. You must be comfortable with non-trivial algorithmic challenges.

**EPAM Systems'** 51 questions show a much greater emphasis on foundational competency. A significant portion, 19 questions, are Easy (E19), with 30 Medium (M30) and only 2 Hard (H2). This distribution aligns with EPAM's position as a global provider of digital platform engineering and software development services, where interviews often focus on core programming skills, clean code, and the ability to handle a variety of client projects.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies frequently test **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are fundamental data structures. **Hash Table** usage is also critical for both, as it's the go-to tool for optimizing lookups and solving frequency-counting problems.

However, their secondary focuses diverge:

- **Twitter** prominently includes **Design**. This signals expectations for system design or object-oriented design questions, especially for roles at mid-to-senior levels. You might be asked to design a scalable service or a class structure.
- **EPAM Systems** highlights **Two Pointers** as a key topic. This points to a strong focus on efficient in-place array/string algorithms, such as sorting, searching, or palindrome checks, which are common in coding assessments.

Here is a classic Two Pointers problem likely for EPAM:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

</div>

A problem more indicative of Twitter's difficulty might involve a Hash Table for an optimized solution:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your experience and the company's focus.

If you are **early in your interview preparation journey or targeting EPAM**, start there. The higher volume of Easy and Medium questions allows you to solidify fundamentals in Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers. Mastering these will build the confidence and skill necessary to tackle more complex problems.

If you are an **experienced engineer aiming for Twitter or similar top-tier firms**, you should prioritize that profile. Begin with Medium problems on core topics (Array, Hash Table, String) to ensure fluency, then quickly progress to Hard problems. You must also dedicate significant time to **Design** practice, as it is a separate and critical interview phase.

Ultimately, EPAM's list serves as an excellent foundation. The skills mastered there are prerequisites for Twitter's more advanced questions. A robust strategy is to build core competency with EPAM-style questions, then layer on the complexity and design focus required for Twitter.
