Landing a software engineering role at Electronic Arts (EA) means passing a technical gauntlet focused on practical problem-solving. The interview process typically involves an initial recruiter screen, one or more technical phone/video interviews using a platform like CoderPad, and a final round of virtual or on-site interviews. These rounds assess your coding skills, system design knowledge, and behavioral fit. The coding portion is algorithm-centric, but with a distinct emphasis on efficiency and clean implementation over obscure theoretical puzzles.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, EA's coding questions skew heavily towards foundational problem-solving. The breakdown is clear: **Easy (67%), Medium (33%), Hard (0%)**. This distribution is critical for your strategy.

The absence of "Hard" problems doesn't mean the interview is easy. It means EA prioritizes **consistency, clarity, and bug-free code** over solving esoteric challenges. You are expected to flawlessly handle array manipulations, standard dynamic programming patterns, and greedy reasoning. The "Medium" questions will test your ability to combine these core concepts under mild time pressure. Missing an edge case on an "Easy" problem is often more damaging than not fully optimizing a "Hard" one elsewhere. Your goal is to demonstrate reliable, production-ready coding habits.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five key areas. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** The bedrock. Expect questions involving traversal, in-place modification, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A staple for medium problems. Focus on bottom-up tabulation for classic problems like knapsack, coin change, or subsequences.
- **Greedy:** Often tested alongside sorting. You must prove, or at least convincingly argue, why a local optimal choice leads to a global solution.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just "sort this." It's a preprocessing step for more complex algorithms, especially greedy or two-pointer methods.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Essential for problems involving managing a running set of top-K elements or merging sorted sequences.

Given that Array and DP are top of the list, the most important pattern to internalize is **Dynamic Programming with Tabulation**. Here is a canonical example: solving the "Climbing Stairs" problem (a classic EA-style easy/medium), followed by a more array-centric "Coin Change" pattern.

```python
# Pattern: DP Tabulation - Climbing Stairs
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

# Pattern: DP Tabulation - Coin Change (Minimum Coins)
def coinChange(coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Pattern: DP Tabulation - Climbing Stairs
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Pattern: DP Tabulation - Coin Change (Minimum Coins)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (const coin of coins) {
    for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Pattern: DP Tabulation - Climbing Stairs
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Pattern: DP Tabulation - Coin Change (Minimum Coins)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.**

- Day 1-3: Master array fundamentals—two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums.
- Day 4-7: Dive into Sorting and Greedy algorithms. Practice problems where sorting is the first step.
- Day 8-14: Focus exclusively on Dynamic Programming. Start with 1D problems (Fibonacci, stairs, coin change) before moving to 2D (matrix paths, knapsack). Write out the recurrence relation and tabulation for every problem.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Integration & Practice.**

- Day 1-7: Study Heaps (Priority Queues). Combine with sorting for "Top K" and "Merge K Sorted Lists" problems.
- Day 8-14: Start doing mixed-topic practice sessions. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter for EA's top topics (Array, DP, Greedy, Sorting, Heap). Solve 2-3 problems daily, with at least one medium difficulty.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement.**

- Simulate the real interview: 45 minutes, camera on, talking through your process. Use EA's question list for practice.
- Prioritize writing clean, compilable code on the first try. Comment on time/space complexity for every solution.
- Revisit all previously solved problems, especially those you struggled with. Ensure you can solve them again from scratch without hints.

## Key Tips

1.  **Talk Through Your Thought Process.** EA interviewers evaluate how you think. Verbally outline your approach, consider edge cases aloud, and explain your optimization before you write code.
2.  **Write Code as You Would in Production.** Use clear variable names, consistent formatting, and include a brief comment for complex logic. A messy but "working" solution is a red flag.
3.  **Test Your Code with Examples.** After writing, don't just say "I'm done." Walk through a standard case and a small edge case (empty input, single element, negative numbers) with your code. This catches bugs and shows thoroughness.
4.  **If Stuck, Simplify.** If a medium problem seems overwhelming, solve it for a trivial case first (e.g., `n=1`). This often reveals the pattern needed for the DP recurrence or greedy rule.

Success at EA is about demonstrating consistent, applied skill. Focus on the core topics, practice clear communication, and write robust code.
