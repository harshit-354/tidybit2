When preparing for technical interviews at top-tier companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each can dramatically increase your efficiency. Goldman Sachs and ByteDance are leaders in their respective industries—finance and tech—and their technical interviews reflect their distinct operational cultures. While both assess core algorithmic problem-solving, the volume, difficulty distribution, and thematic emphasis of their questions differ significantly. This comparison analyzes their question banks to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question pools. Goldman Sachs's catalog is extensive, with **270 questions** categorized by difficulty: 51 Easy, 171 Medium, and 48 Hard. This large volume suggests a broader range of potential problems and a deep bench of classic algorithmic challenges. Preparing for Goldman Sachs requires covering significant ground, with a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which constitute over 63% of their question bank.

In contrast, ByteDance's list is more curated, with **64 questions**: 6 Easy, 49 Medium, and 9 Hard. Here, the focus is even more concentrated on **Medium problems**, making up approximately 77% of their questions. The smaller, more intense list implies that ByteDance's interviews may drill deeper into a core set of challenging concepts rather than testing wide-ranging familiarity. The lower number of Hard questions for ByteDance (9 vs. 48) does not necessarily mean easier interviews; it often means their Medium questions are particularly complex or applied.

**Preparation Implication:** For Goldman Sachs, build stamina and breadth. For ByteDance, achieve mastery and depth on core, high-quality Medium problems.

## Topic Overlap

Despite their different domains, both companies heavily test the same four fundamental data structures and algorithms: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This overlap is your strategic advantage.

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock for most problems. Expect manipulations, searches, subarray/substring problems, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Hash Table:** Crucial for achieving O(1) lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, duplicates, and complement searches (like Two Sum).
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for advanced roles. Both companies use it to assess optimal substructure and state transition thinking for problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, or unique paths.

The shared focus means a strong foundation in these four areas serves a dual purpose. However, the _context_ of problems may differ. Goldman Sachs questions might be framed in scenarios involving financial transactions or scheduling, while ByteDance problems could relate to user engagement metrics, text/feature processing, or system design lite.

```python
# Example: A "Two Sum" variant (uses Array & Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Goldman Sachs context: Find two trades that net a target P&L.
# ByteDance context: Find two content IDs whose combined watch time equals a target.
```

```javascript
// Example: A "Two Sum" variant (uses Array & Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A "Two Sum" variant (uses Array & Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **ByteDance**. Its focused, high-quality Medium problem list provides an excellent, efficient core curriculum. Mastering these 64 questions will force you to develop deep problem-solving skills in the four critical topic areas. This creates a strong algorithmic foundation.

Once comfortable with ByteDance's core, expand your preparation to **Goldman Sachs**. Use their vast 270-question bank to test your core knowledge under pressure, increase your speed, and expose yourself to a wider variety of problem framings and edge cases. This sequence—depth first, then breadth—ensures you build robust skills before expanding your repertoire.

Ultimately, prioritize the company you are interviewing with first. But if you have the time, the ByteDance-to-Goldman Sachs progression is a logical skill-building path.
