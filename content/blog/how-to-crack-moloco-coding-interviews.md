Moloco’s coding interviews are a direct test of your ability to solve practical, data-intensive problems. As a leader in machine learning-driven advertising and monetization, their process focuses on algorithmic problem-solving that mirrors the challenges of building scalable, real-time systems. You’ll typically face two to three rounds of technical interviews, each centered on a medium-to-hard coding question, followed by discussions on system design and behavioral fit. Success hinges on a clear, efficient approach to common data structures and traversal algorithms.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our analysis of recent Moloco questions reveals a clear pattern: **83% (10 out of 12) are Medium difficulty, with 17% (2 out of 12) being Hard.** There are no Easy problems.

This distribution is telling. It means the interview is designed to filter for strong, consistent problem-solvers, not just candidates who can handle basics. The "Medium" tag can be deceptive; at a company like Moloco, these questions often involve multiple steps, careful edge-case handling, and optimization. The two Hard problems are your differentiators—they likely involve combining several advanced concepts or require non-trivial optimizations. Your goal is to master the Medium tier to secure a pass, then tackle Hard problems to stand out.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Depth your understanding here rather than spreading yourself too thin.

- **Array:** Fundamental to almost all data processing. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, or prefix sums.
- **Stack:** Crucial for parsing, validation, and maintaining state (e.g., monotonic stacks for next-greater-element problems).
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The workhorses for tree and graph traversal. DFS is key for recursion and backtracking; BFS is essential for shortest-path or level-order problems.
- **String:** Often combined with arrays or stacks. Focus on anagram checks, palindromes, and substring searches.

Given the prevalence of **DFS/BFS**, mastering iterative and recursive traversal is non-negotiable. Here is a fundamental template for performing **DFS on a graph represented as an adjacency list**, a pattern that underlies many problems.

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            # Process node here
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    return visited
```

```javascript
function dfsIterative(graph, start) {
  const visited = new Set();
  const stack = [start];

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const node = stack.pop();
    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      visited.add(node);
      // Process node here
      for (const neighbor of graph[node] || []) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          stack.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return visited;
}
```

```java
public Set<Integer> dfsIterative(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start) {
    Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    stack.push(start);

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        int node = stack.pop();
        if (!visited.contains(node)) {
            visited.add(node);
            // Process node here
            for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return visited;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Drill **Arrays** and **Strings**. Practice in-place operations, two-pointer techniques, and sliding windows.
- Days 8-14: Master **Stack** and **Queue**. Implement BFS/DFS from scratch. Solve 15-20 problems focusing solely on these four topics.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Integration**

- Deep dive into **Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)**. Practice on matrix problems (number of islands), tree serialization, and shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- Start integrating topics. Solve problems like "Decode String" (Stack + String) or "Course Schedule" (DFS + Graph).
- Begin attempting the **Hard** problems from Moloco's list. Focus on understanding the solution approach, not just the answer.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Conduct at least 6-8 timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes each) using Medium/Hard problems from similar companies.
- Simulate the full process: clarify requirements, discuss approach, code, test with examples, and analyze complexity.
- In the final days, review all your notes and re-solve 5-10 of the most challenging problems you encountered without help.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Aloud.** Moloco engineers look for clarity of thought. Before writing code, verbally outline your brute-force idea, then optimize. Explain your space/time complexity trade-offs.
2.  **Validate Input and Test Edge Cases.** For array and string problems, explicitly check for empty input, single elements, and large values. Write your test cases as comments before coding.
3.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Write clean, modular code with clear variable names. A slightly suboptimal but perfectly readable solution is better than a "clever" one that's hard to follow. You can always optimize later if time permits.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** Turn off auto-complete and syntax highlighting during practice sessions. This mimics the interview environment and improves your accuracy.

Mastering these patterns and executing this focused plan will position you strongly for Moloco's technical challenges.
