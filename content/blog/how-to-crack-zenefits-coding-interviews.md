Zenefits’s coding interviews follow a standard tech industry pattern: one or two rounds of algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via video call with a shared code editor. Expect questions that test both your problem-solving process and your ability to write clean, efficient code under time constraints. The focus is on practical data structure and algorithm application, not theoretical deep dives.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of 21 recent questions, the difficulty distribution is:

- **Easy:** 5 (24%)
- **Medium:** 11 (52%)
- **Hard:** 5 (24%)

This breakdown is telling. The majority (over 75%) of questions are Medium or Hard, meaning you cannot afford to skip advanced topics. The high percentage of Medium questions is your key target—mastering these is the baseline for passing. The significant Hard portion (nearly a quarter) means you must also be prepared for complex problems, often involving optimization or combining multiple concepts. You need a strategy that efficiently covers breadth (to handle the array of Medium problems) and selective depth (for the tough Hard ones).

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward these five areas, which dominate Zenefits's question pool.

**Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect questions on searching, sorting, subarray sums, and in-place manipulations. Master prefix sums and the two-pointer technique.
**String:** Closely related to array problems. Focus on palindrome checks, anagrams, substring searches, and string transformation using two-pointers or sliding windows.
**Divide and Conquer:** A critical algorithm paradigm for Zenefits. This is often tested via advanced array problems, like finding a peak element or optimized search in a rotated sorted array. Understand how to break a problem into independent subproblems.
**Stack:** Essential for parsing, validation, and next-greater-element problems. The classic pattern is using a stack to maintain a monotonic sequence, which solves many problems in O(n) time.
**Linked List:** Test your pointer manipulation skills. Focus on cycle detection, reversals, and merges. The fast & slow pointer technique is non-negotiable.

For Zenefits, the **Monotonic Stack** pattern for array problems and the **Divide and Conquer** approach are particularly high-yield. Here is a classic example of a monotonic stack solving the "Next Greater Element" problem.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # Monotonically decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for i in range(n * 2):  # Handle circular array
        idx = i % n
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[idx]:
            popped_idx = stack.pop()
            result[popped_idx] = nums[idx]
        if i < n:  # Only push the first occurrence of each index
            stack.append(idx)
    return result
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // Monotonically decreasing stack (stores indices)

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    // Handle circular array
    const idx = i % n;
    while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < nums[idx]) {
      const poppedIdx = stack.pop();
      result[poppedIdx] = nums[idx];
    }
    if (i < n) {
      // Only push the first occurrence of each index
      stack.push(idx);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Monotonically decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) { // Handle circular array
        int idx = i % n;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[idx]) {
            int poppedIdx = stack.pop();
            result[poppedIdx] = nums[idx];
        }
        if (i < n) { // Only push the first occurrence of each index
            stack.push(idx);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists. Solve 2-3 problems daily from each topic, starting with Easy and moving to Medium. Implement all standard operations from scratch. For Arrays, ensure you are fluent with two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & High-Yield Topics.** Shift focus to Divide and Conquer and Stack. For Divide and Conquer, practice problems like "Find Peak Element" and "Kth Largest Element." For Stack, master the monotonic stack pattern shown above. Begin mixing in Hard problems from these topics.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new patterns. Use this time for full-spectrum practice. Solve 2-3 random Medium/Hard problems daily under timed conditions (45 minutes). Simulate the actual interview: explain your thought process aloud, write code, and test edge cases. Revisit all previously solved problems from the top five topics to solidify patterns.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process First.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, including time/space complexity. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving path as much as the final solution.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** Often, a brute-force solution is an acceptable starting point. State it, then refine it. Saying "I can start with O(n²) and optimize using a hash map to O(n)" shows structured thinking.
3.  **Practice Writing Bug-Free Code.** Zenefits questions often involve intricate index manipulation (especially with arrays and stacks). Write clean code with clear variable names and add inline comments for complex logic to avoid off-by-one errors.
4.  **Don't Ignore Edge Cases.** For array/string problems, explicitly check for empty input, single element, duplicates, and sorted/unsorted states. Mentioning these demonstrates thoroughness.
5.  **Master One Language Deeply.** Use Python for brevity, Java for type clarity, or JavaScript for full-stack roles—but know your chosen language's standard library for collections and utilities cold.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the most reliable method to pass. The question distribution means you will face a challenging problem; your preparation will determine if you can break it down.
