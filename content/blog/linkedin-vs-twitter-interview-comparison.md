When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and priorities of each platform can significantly streamline your study. LinkedIn and Twitter (now X) present distinct interview landscapes, characterized by different question volumes, difficulty distributions, and topical focuses. A targeted approach, based on these differences, is more effective than a generic one-size-fits-all strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. LinkedIn's list of approximately 180 questions is over three times larger than Twitter's list of about 53. This volume suggests a broader pool of potential problems and a greater emphasis on encountering a wide range of scenarios.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **LinkedIn (E26/M117/H37):** The majority of questions are Medium (65%), with a significant portion of Hard (21%) and a smaller set of Easy (14%). This indicates LinkedIn's interviews are heavily weighted toward complex problem-solving and algorithmic optimization.
- **Twitter (E8/M33/H12):** The balance also leans toward Medium (62%), but with a smaller proportion of Hard (23%) and a slightly larger share of Easy (15%). While still challenging, this points to a slightly more accessible average difficulty, though the Hard questions will be intensely rigorous.

In essence, preparing for LinkedIn requires grinding through a larger number of predominantly medium-to-hard problems, while Twitter demands deep, precise mastery of a more curated set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the core of both question banks. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key differentiators lie in the secondary focuses:

- **LinkedIn's distinctive focus** is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, reflecting the importance of tree and graph traversal for problems related to social networks, hierarchies, and connected data—core to LinkedIn's professional graph.
- **Twitter's distinctive focus** is **Design**. This aligns with Twitter's real-time, high-scale systems engineering challenges, where designing scalable and efficient architectures for features like feeds, trends, and notifications is paramount.

This divergence means your study plan must branch. For LinkedIn, graph traversal and recursion are critical. For Twitter, you must complement your coding practice with system design fundamentals.

```python
# Example of a common pattern: DFS on a binary tree (LinkedIn focus)
def dfs(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    # Recursively search left and right subtrees
    return dfs(node.left, target) or dfs(node.right, target)
```

```javascript
// Example of a common pattern: DFS on a binary tree (LinkedIn focus)
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  // Recursively search left and right subtrees
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example of a common pattern: DFS on a binary tree (LinkedIn focus)
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    // Recursively search left and right subtrees
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company you are most targeting.

1.  **Start with the Shared Foundation:** Regardless of your target, begin with the overlapping core: **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Solve high-frequency problems for these topics from both lists. This builds the essential muscle memory for problem-solving.

2.  **If targeting LinkedIn:** After the core, immediately pivot to **Depth-First Search** and graph problems. The large number of Medium questions means you need to practice speed and accuracy on a wide variety of problems. Grind the LinkedIn list extensively.

3.  **If targeting Twitter:** After the core, dedicate substantial time to **System Design**. For coding, focus on mastering every problem on Twitter's more compact list, ensuring you can handle their Hard questions with optimal solutions. Depth over breadth is key here.

4.  **General Strategy:** If preparing for both, master the shared topics first. Then, integrate LinkedIn's DFS practice and Twitter's design study into your weekly schedule. Since LinkedIn's list is larger and more difficult on average, allocating more coding practice time to its patterns is a prudent default.

Ultimately, success lies in adapting your study to the company's profile. Use LinkedIn's list for volume and graph practice, and Twitter's list for focused depth and design readiness.
