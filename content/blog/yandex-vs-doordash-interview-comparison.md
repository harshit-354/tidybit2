When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Yandex and DoorDash, while both prominent in their respective regions and industries, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question profiles to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of documented questions.

**Yandex** has a significantly larger pool with **134 questions**, categorized as 52 Easy, 72 Medium, and 10 Hard. This indicates a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which form the bulk of their interview process. The relatively low number of Hard questions suggests that while the interviews are challenging, they may prioritize algorithmic correctness and clean implementation over highly complex, obscure optimizations.

**DoorDash** has a more concentrated set of **87 questions**, with a steeper difficulty curve: 6 Easy, 51 Medium, and 30 Hard. The high proportion of Hard questions (over 34%) is notable. This points to an interview process that deeply tests advanced problem-solving, optimization, and handling of edge cases, likely reflecting the complex real-world logistics and system design challenges inherent in their delivery platform.

In summary, Yandex tests breadth with a large volume of Medium problems, while DoorDash tests depth with a significant focus on Hard scenarios.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with different secondary emphases.

**Core Shared Topics:** Array, Hash Table, and String problems are central to both. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures, using hash maps for efficient lookups, and applying common patterns like sliding windows or two-pointer techniques.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common to both)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common to both)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common to both)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

**Diverging Focus:**

- **Yandex** prominently lists **Two Pointers** as a key topic, reinforcing the importance of in-place array/string manipulation and efficient traversal patterns.
- **DoorDash** uniquely highlights **Depth-First Search (DFS)** as a top topic. This suggests a frequent appearance of tree and graph traversal problems, which model hierarchical data (like menus) or network/graph problems relevant to mapping and logistics.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS (crucial for DoorDash)
def dfs_tree(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    return dfs_tree(node.left, target) or dfs_tree(node.right, target)
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS (crucial for DoorDash)
function dfsTree(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfsTree(node.left, target) || dfsTree(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS (crucial for DoorDash)
public boolean dfsTree(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfsTree(node.left, target) || dfsTree(node.right, target);
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your priority should be dictated by your target company and interview timeline.

**Prepare for DoorDash first if** you are actively interviewing with them or similar US-based tech companies. The high density of Hard questions demands dedicated practice on complex problem-solving. Solidify your core skills (Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings) and then drill deeply into **graph and tree traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)**, recursion, and backtracking. Expect to justify time/space complexity rigorously.

**Prepare for Yandex first if** you are targeting them or other European/Russian tech firms, or if you are in the early stages of building foundational speed and accuracy. The vast pool of Medium problems is excellent for broadening your pattern recognition across fundamental topics. Master **Two Pointers**, sliding window, and basic dynamic programming. This preparation creates a strong base that is also transferable to many other companies.

Ultimately, a strong candidate for either will have mastered the shared core. Start with that foundation, then branch into Two Pointers depth for Yandex or DFS/Graph mastery for DoorDash.
