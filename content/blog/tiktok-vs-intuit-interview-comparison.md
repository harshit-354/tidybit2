When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. Comparing TikTok and Intuit, two major but distinct tech players, highlights clear differences in interview focus and preparation strategy. TikTok, a social media giant, emphasizes high-volume, algorithm-intensive problem-solving, while Intuit, a financial software leader, focuses on a more moderate, business-contextualized technical screen. Understanding their question banks—TikTok's 383 questions versus Intuit's 71—is the first step in tailoring your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of reported questions is the most striking difference. TikTok's list of 383 questions (Easy: 42, Medium: 260, Hard: 81) indicates a rapidly evolving and extensive interview process, typical of fast-paced, product-driven tech companies. The heavy skew toward Medium and Hard problems suggests they deeply test algorithmic optimization and complex problem-solving under pressure. You can expect multi-layered questions that combine several concepts.

Intuit's list is significantly smaller at 71 questions (Easy: 10, Medium: 47, Hard: 14). This reflects a more focused and possibly more consistent interview loop. The distribution is still Medium-heavy, but with fewer extreme Hard problems, pointing to an emphasis on solid foundational knowledge applied to practical, likely finance-adjacent scenarios. The lower volume makes it more feasible to achieve coverage of their question bank.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures and algorithms. The top topics for both are nearly identical: **Array, String, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Hash Table**. This overlap is good news for preparation, as mastering these fundamentals serves both targets.

- **Arrays & Strings:** These are universal. Expect manipulations, searches, and sliding window problems.
- **Hash Tables:** Crucial for efficient lookups and frequency counting in both interview sets.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for difficulty. Both companies test it, but TikTok's larger pool suggests more variety and complexity in DP problems (e.g., multi-dimensional states, tricky optimizations).

The main difference lies in the _context and depth_. TikTok, with its vast question pool, might present these topics in abstract, highly algorithmic puzzles. Intuit is more likely to frame problems within scenarios involving data processing, transactions, or user records, even if the underlying algorithm is standard.

```python
# Example: A common "Hash Table & String" pattern (Anagram check)
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for char in t:
        if char not in count or count[char] == 0:
            return False
        count[char] -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: A common "Hash Table & String" pattern (Anagram check)
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = {};
  for (let char of s) {
    count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
  }
  for (let char of t) {
    if (!count[char]) return false;
    count[char]--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common "Hash Table & String" pattern (Anagram check)
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
    int[] count = new int[26]; // assuming lowercase English letters
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count[c - 'a']++;
    }
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (--count[c - 'a'] < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Intuit**. Its smaller, more focused question set allows you to efficiently build confidence and cover a high percentage of likely topics. Achieving a strong command of Medium-level problems on core topics like Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables will form an excellent foundation. This approach provides a quicker "win" and a solid base.

Then, pivot to **TikTok**. Use the broader, deeper foundation from Intuit prep to tackle TikTok's extensive catalog. Here, you must ramp up on advanced Dynamic Programming variations, complex graph problems (implied by their focus), and practice solving more Hard problems under time constraints. The goal is to expand your breadth and depth to handle their wider and more challenging problem set.

In summary, prepare for Intuit first to build a robust core efficiently. Then, use that foundation to scale your skills for the greater volume and difficulty of TikTok's interviews. Master the shared fundamentals—Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming—as they are the currency of both technical screens.
