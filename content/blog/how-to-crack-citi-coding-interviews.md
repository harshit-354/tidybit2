Citi’s technical interviews for software engineering and related roles are designed to assess foundational problem-solving and coding skills. The process typically involves one or two rounds of coding interviews, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or CoderPad, focusing on practical algorithm and data structure problems. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication rather than obscure computer science trivia.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: Citi’s coding interviews are heavily weighted toward fundamental problem-solving. With 67% Easy and 33% Medium questions, and 0% Hard, the signal is unambiguous. They are testing for competency, not genius. You will not face convoluted graph algorithms or complex system design puzzles here. Instead, you must demonstrate flawless execution on core concepts. Missing an edge case on an Easy problem is far more damaging than not solving a Hard one. This distribution means your goal is not just to solve problems, but to solve them perfectly—with optimal time/space complexity, clean code, and robust handling of all inputs.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these five high-frequency topics.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place manipulation, and two-pointer techniques. Master sliding window and subarray problems.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for Medium problems. Focus on 1D DP for classic problems like climbing stairs or maximum subarray. Understand the core concept of overlapping subproblems and memoization.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to optimize brute-force solutions. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, or duplicate detection.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, modular arithmetic, or basic computations. Often tests your ability to find mathematical shortcuts to avoid simulation.
- **Stack:** Crucial for parsing, reversal, and "next greater element" type problems. Understand its LIFO property for managing nested or sequential dependencies.

For Citi, **Dynamic Programming** often appears in their Medium-difficulty questions. The most important pattern to know is the 1D DP approach for a problem like "Climbing Stairs" or "Maximum Subarray Sum." Here is the Kadane's Algorithm pattern for Maximum Subarray, which is a form of DP:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    """
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # The core DP decision: start a new subarray or extend the current one?
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
        # Track the best result found so far
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
    return global_max
```

```javascript
function maxSubArray(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0];
  let globalMax = nums[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // The core DP decision: start a new subarray or extend the current one?
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
    // Track the best result found so far
    globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
  }
  return globalMax;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int currentMax = nums[0];
    int globalMax = nums[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // The core DP decision: start a new subarray or extend the current one?
        currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
        // Track the best result found so far
        globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
    }
    return globalMax;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan beats cramming.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate one week to **Arrays** and **Hash Tables**. Solve 15-20 Easy problems on each topic. The next week, tackle **Stack** and **Math**. Ensure you can implement standard operations and recognize when to use these structures without hesitation.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Competency.** Focus entirely on **Dynamic Programming**. Start with the fundamentals: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, and the 0/1 Knapsack problem. Progress to 1D problems like Maximum Subarray and Coin Change. Understand the recurrence relation before writing code. Solve at least 10-15 DP problems.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new topics. Re-solve the most common problems from your target list. Perform at least 5-10 timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes each) under realistic conditions. Use a platform that records your screen and audio to review your problem-solving process, communication, and coding habits.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** When presented with a problem, spend the first 2-3 minutes talking through your understanding, edge cases, and proposed approach. Ask clarifying questions. This demonstrates structured thinking, which is often as important as the final code.
2.  **Optimize for Readability, Not Cleverness.** Use descriptive variable names. Write helper functions for logical chunks of code. Add brief inline comments for complex logic. The interviewer needs to easily follow your solution. Obfuscated, "clever" one-liners are a liability.
3.  **Test Your Code Verbally.** Before declaring a problem solved, walk through your code with a sample input, including edge cases (empty array, single element, negative numbers). Explain what each line does as you trace the execution. This catches bugs and shows thoroughness.
4.  **Know Your "Why."** For every solution, be prepared to explain _why_ you chose a particular data structure or algorithm and its time/space complexity. Saying "I'll use a hash map for O(1) lookups" is far better than just silently implementing one.

Mastering these fundamentals and demonstrating clear, reliable coding skill is the definitive path to success in Citi's technical interviews.
