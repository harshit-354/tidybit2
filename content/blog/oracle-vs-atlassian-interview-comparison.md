When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can dramatically improve your efficiency. Oracle and Atlassian represent two distinct archetypes: a legacy tech giant with a massive, broad engineering footprint and a focused software company known for its developer and collaboration tools. A direct comparison of their publicly cataloged interview questions reveals significant differences in volume, difficulty, and focus, which should directly inform your study strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of questions associated with each company. Oracle's list is extensive, with approximately **340 questions** categorized by difficulty: 70 Easy, 205 Medium, and 65 Hard. This vast repository suggests several things: Oracle's technical interviews draw from a wide pool of problems, its engineering roles are highly varied (from database to cloud to applications), and there is a long history of reported questions. Preparing for Oracle requires building a broad and deep foundation in data structures and algorithms.

In contrast, Atlassian's list is more contained, with about **62 questions**: 7 Easy, 43 Medium, and 12 Hard. The lower volume, especially in the Easy and Hard categories, indicates a more focused interview process. The heavy weighting toward Medium-difficulty problems aligns with Atlassian's reputation for assessing strong, practical coding skills and problem-solving on problems commonly found in software development for their products (e.g., Jira, Confluence). The preparation scope for Atlassian is narrower and more targeted.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, but with different secondary priorities.

**Shared Core Topics:** Both lists highlight **Array, String, and Hash Table** as top topics. These are the absolute essentials for any coding interview. You must be proficient in manipulating these data structures, using two-pointers, sliding windows, and hash maps for efficient lookups.

```python
# Example: Hash Table for a frequency counter (common in both)
def count_elements(arr):
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    return freq
```

```javascript
// Example: Hash Table for a frequency counter (common in both)
function countElements(arr) {
  const freq = new Map();
  for (const num of arr) {
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return freq;
}
```

```java
// Example: Hash Table for a frequency counter (common in both)
import java.util.HashMap;

public Map<Integer, Integer> countElements(int[] arr) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : arr) {
        freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freq;
}
```

**Oracle's Distinct Emphasis:** Oracle's list prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The presence of 65 Hard questions, many likely DP-based, signals that Oracle interviews for certain roles may delve into complex optimization problems, testing advanced algorithmic thinking. This is characteristic of companies with strong low-level systems and database optimization backgrounds.

**Atlassian's Distinct Emphasis:** Atlassian specifically calls out **Sorting** as a top topic. This suggests a focus on problems involving data organization, merging, and searching—skills highly relevant to building features for managing tickets, documents, and user permissions in their products. While sorting is a fundamental concept, its explicit prominence hints at its practical application in their problem sets.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company's focus.

**Prepare for Atlassian first if:** You are interviewing with them sooner, or you want to start with a more manageable, focused goal. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and becoming very strong on Medium-difficulty problems, especially those involving sorting logic, will cover a large portion of their question bank. You can build confidence with a targeted approach.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You have an interview scheduled, or you are building a comprehensive, long-term foundation. Tackling Oracle's list is a more monumental task. Starting here will force you to cover a wider range of problems, including the challenging Dynamic Programming questions. Successfully preparing for Oracle's breadth and depth will inherently make you well-prepared for Atlassian's more focused set, as you will have covered all the core topics and more.

In summary, use Atlassian's list for efficient, targeted practice and Oracle's list for a rigorous, comprehensive deep dive into algorithmic problem-solving. For detailed question lists and patterns, visit the TidyBit pages for [Oracle](/company/oracle) and [Atlassian](/company/atlassian).
