When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly impact your preparation efficiency. Amazon and PayPal, while both prominent in the tech industry, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question profiles to help you strategize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of question volume differs dramatically. Amazon's question bank is vast, with approximately 1938 documented questions categorized by difficulty: 530 Easy, 1057 Medium, and 351 Hard. This immense pool reflects Amazon's wide-ranging roles and the intense, data-driven nature of its interview process, often described as rigorous and comprehensive. You must be prepared for a broad sweep of problems.

In contrast, PayPal's catalog is more contained, with around 106 questions: 18 Easy, 69 Medium, and 19 Hard. The smaller volume suggests a more focused or predictable question set, but the high proportion of Medium-difficulty questions (roughly 65%) indicates that depth of understanding on core topics is critical. The lower total count does not necessarily mean an easier interview; it means your preparation can be more targeted.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are staples at both Amazon and PayPal. This common ground is your essential core.

The key differentiator is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Amazon's profile explicitly lists DP as a top topic, which aligns with its reputation for asking complex optimization problems, especially for higher-level or more technical roles. You cannot afford to skip DP preparation for Amazon.

PayPal's listed topics include **Sorting** instead of DP. This suggests a stronger focus on algorithmic fundamentals, data manipulation, and possibly system design aspects related to transactions and data processing. While DP questions may still appear, the explicit topic list points toward a different weighting.

Consider a classic problem that highlights the emphasis:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# A Hash Table/Two-Sum problem, common at both.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# A Dynamic Programming problem, more critical for Amazon.
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// A Hash Table/Two-Sum problem, common at both.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// A Dynamic Programming problem, more critical for Amazon.
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// A Hash Table/Two-Sum problem, common at both.
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// A Dynamic Programming problem, more critical for Amazon.
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Master problems involving Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. These are non-negotiable for either company and form the basis for more complex questions.

If your target is **Amazon**, you must prioritize Dynamic Programming after the core. The large question bank means practicing a high volume of problems across all difficulties is necessary. Use the breadth of questions to familiarize yourself with various problem patterns.

If your target is **PayPal**, drill deeply into the core topics and Sorting algorithms. With a smaller question bank, you can aim for thorough mastery of each documented problem and its variations. Ensure you understand sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) and their applications inside out.

For candidates interviewing at both, begin with the PayPal-focused core and sorting practice. This builds a strong base. Then, expand your study to include Amazon's requirements by adding extensive DP practice and working through a larger volume of problems to build stamina and pattern recognition.
