When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes. Adobe and Yahoo, both established tech giants, have distinct interview footprints on coding platforms. Adobe's list is larger and more challenging, while Yahoo's is more compact and moderate. Understanding these differences helps you allocate your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a clear story about the depth and intensity of each company's technical screening.

Adobe's list of **227 questions** is substantial, categorized as Easy (68), Medium (129), and Hard (30). This volume indicates a broad and deep question bank, with a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**. Preparing for Adobe means you must be comfortable with a wide variety of moderately complex algorithmic challenges, with a significant number of hard problems ensuring you can handle optimization and edge cases.

Yahoo's list is more focused, with **64 questions** total: Easy (26), Medium (32), and Hard (6). The distribution is more balanced across Easy and Medium, with very few Hard problems. This suggests Yahoo's interviews might focus more on core competency and clean implementation of standard patterns rather than on solving the most obscure optimization challenges.

```python
# Example of a common Medium-difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Adobe M, Yahoo E)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# A more complex Medium problem might involve two pointers on a string.
def is_palindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example of a common Medium-difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Adobe M, Yahoo E)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// A more complex Medium problem might involve two pointers on a string.
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) left++;
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) right--;
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example of a common Medium-difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Adobe M, Yahoo E)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// A more complex Medium problem might involve two pointers on a string.
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Array, String, Hash Table** are top-three for both.
- **Two Pointers** is a key fourth topic for Adobe, highlighting their focus on in-place array/string manipulation and efficiency.
- **Sorting** appears in Yahoo's top four, suggesting questions that may involve arranging data as a fundamental step.

This significant overlap is advantageous. Mastering these core topics—particularly array manipulation, hash map usage for lookups, and string processing—will build a strong foundation for interviews at either company. The difference is in the application: Adobe's questions will likely use these structures in more complex, multi-step algorithms, while Yahoo's may test them in a more straightforward manner.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be dictated by your interview timeline and the companies' relative difficulty.

**Prepare for Adobe first if you have time.** Its larger, more difficult question set covers a wider algorithmic scope. Successfully working through Adobe's Medium and Hard problems will inherently prepare you for the vast majority of Yahoo's questions. The reverse is not true; preparing only for Yahoo's list may leave you underprepared for the depth and variety of an Adobe interview.

**Prepare for Yahoo first if you are short on time or need to build confidence.** Its focused list allows you to solidify the most common patterns without being overwhelmed. You can efficiently achieve coverage of their expected problem types. This approach is optimal if a Yahoo interview is imminent, or if you are using it as a stepping stone to more difficult company lists later.

In essence, Adobe preparation is comprehensive training, while Yahoo preparation is targeted practice. Build your core skills with Yahoo's list, then stress-test and expand them with Adobe's.
