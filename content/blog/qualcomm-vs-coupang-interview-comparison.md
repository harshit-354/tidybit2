When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can dramatically improve your efficiency. Qualcomm, a semiconductor and telecommunications giant, and Coupang, South Korea's leading e-commerce company, present distinct interview landscapes. While both assess core algorithmic problem-solving, their focus, difficulty distribution, and favored topics differ significantly. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you tailor your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a clear difference in how each company structures its technical screening.

**Qualcomm's** 56 questions are distributed with a heavier emphasis on easier problems: 25 Easy (E25), 22 Medium (M22), and 9 Hard (H9). This suggests their interview process may be designed to thoroughly assess fundamental competency and coding clarity. Succeeding here requires consistent, bug-free execution on standard problems. The relatively lower proportion of Hard questions indicates that while advanced problem-solving is valued, mastery of core concepts is the primary gate.

**Coupang's** 53 questions show a starkly different distribution: only 3 Easy (E3), 36 Medium (M36), and 14 Hard (H14). This profile is characteristic of a highly competitive, "FAANG-style" interview process. The overwhelming focus on Medium and Hard problems means you must be prepared to tackle complex algorithmic challenges under pressure. The low number of Easy questions implies they are used more for initial screening or warm-up, not as primary evaluation tools.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize **Array** and **String** manipulation, making these foundational topics non-negotiable. Mastery here is essential for both.

The divergence in secondary topics is where preparation must be specialized.

**Qualcomm's** key topics include **Two Pointers** and **Math**. The Two Pointers technique is crucial for optimizing solutions involving sorted data or sequences, while Math problems test logical reasoning and the ability to derive formulas.

```python
# Qualcomm-style Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read-1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Qualcomm-style Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Qualcomm-style Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

**Coupang's** key topics are **Hash Table** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Hash Table questions test your ability to design efficient lookups and handle frequency counting. The significant presence of DP indicates a deep focus on optimization problems, recursive thinking, and state management—common in complex system design scenarios for e-commerce (e.g., inventory, routing, pricing).

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Coupang-style DP: Climbing Stairs (foundational)
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Coupang-style DP: Climbing Stairs (foundational)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Coupang-style DP: Climbing Stairs (foundational)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your current skill level and interview timeline.

If you are **earlier in your interview prep journey or prioritizing fundamentals**, start with **Qualcomm**. Its higher volume of Easy and Medium problems provides a structured path to solidify core data structures (Array, String) and essential techniques like Two Pointers. Success here builds the consistent coding muscle memory needed for any technical interview.

If you are **already comfortable with fundamentals and aiming for high-difficulty roles**, or if your Coupang interview is sooner, begin with **Coupang**. Its profile demands immediate immersion in Medium and Hard problems. You must prioritize mastering Hash Table applications and, crucially, building a strong intuition for Dynamic Programming patterns. This is more challenging but aligns with top-tier tech interview expectations.

A strategic hybrid approach is to use Qualcomm's question set for foundational drill and Coupang's for intense, high-difficulty practice sessions to simulate the pressure of their actual interviews.
