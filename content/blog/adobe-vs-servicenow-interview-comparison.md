When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study process. Adobe and ServiceNow, while both requiring strong algorithmic problem-solving skills, present distinct profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topic focus. A targeted comparison reveals how to allocate your preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of documented questions is the most immediate difference. Adobe's repository of **227 questions** is nearly three times the size of ServiceNow's **78 questions**. This suggests that for Adobe, you may encounter a wider variety of problems, and rote memorization of a small list is less feasible. The difficulty distribution also varies meaningfully.

- **Adobe (E68/M129/H30)**: The distribution is classic, with a strong emphasis on **Medium** difficulty problems (57% of total). This indicates a balanced interview loop designed to assess core competency through standard challenges, with a smaller but significant set of Hard problems to differentiate top candidates.
- **ServiceNow (E8/M58/H12)**: The focus is even more pronounced on **Medium** difficulty, constituting about 74% of its question bank. The number of Easy and Hard questions is relatively low. This points to an interview process that heavily tests applied problem-solving on common patterns, with less emphasis on very simple fundamentals or extreme algorithmic complexity.

In essence, Adobe's process is broader and has a higher ceiling, while ServiceNow's is more narrowly focused on proficiently solving common, mid-tier challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structure manipulation. The overlapping core topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either company.

- **Adobe's Additional Focus**: **Two Pointers** is a highlighted topic. This technique is crucial for solving a vast array of problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or sliding windows, often in combination with the other core topics.
  <div class="code-group">

  ```python
  # Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
  def removeDuplicates(nums):
      if not nums:
          return 0
      i = 0
      for j in range(1, len(nums)):
          if nums[j] != nums[i]:
              i += 1
              nums[i] = nums[j]
      return i + 1
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
  function removeDuplicates(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    let i = 0;
    for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
        i++;
        nums[i] = nums[j];
      }
    }
    return i + 1;
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
  public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
      if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
      int i = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
          if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
              i++;
              nums[i] = nums[j];
          }
      }
      return i + 1;
  }
  ```

  </div>

- **ServiceNow's Additional Focus**: **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is explicitly highlighted. This signals that you should be prepared for at least one problem involving optimal substructure, such as classic problems like climbing stairs, knapsack variations, or subsequence problems.
  <div class="code-group">

  ```python
  # DP: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci pattern)
  def climbStairs(n):
      if n <= 2:
          return n
      dp = [0] * (n + 1)
      dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
      for i in range(3, n + 1):
          dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
      return dp[n]
  ```

  ```javascript
  // DP: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci pattern)
  function climbStairs(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
      dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // DP: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci pattern)
  public int climbStairs(int n) {
      if (n <= 2) return n;
      int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
      dp[1] = 1;
      dp[2] = 2;
      for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
          dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
      }
      return dp[n];
  }
  ```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company's profile.

**Prepare for ServiceNow first if:** You are interviewing there sooner, or you want to build confidence with a more concentrated set of problems. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) plus Dynamic Programming will cover a large portion of their question focus. The smaller question bank allows for more comprehensive review.

**Prepare for Adobe first if:** Your goal is to build a broader and deeper foundation that will subsequently make ServiceNow preparation feel like a subset. Covering Adobe's large volume, especially its significant number of Medium problems and Two Pointers techniques, will inherently strengthen your skills on ServiceNow's core topics. However, you must then **explicitly add Dynamic Programming practice** to your regimen.

Ultimately, a strong candidate for either company will be proficient with Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and common algorithms. The difference lies in Adobe's greater breadth and emphasis on Two Pointers versus ServiceNow's sharper focus on Medium problems and the specific need for DP readiness.
