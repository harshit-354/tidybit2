Expedia’s technical interviews are designed to assess practical problem-solving skills relevant to large-scale travel platforms. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often with a system design component for more senior roles. Questions tend to be applied, testing your ability to manipulate common data types like arrays and strings to solve real-world logistical problems.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 54 Expedia coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 13 Easy (24%), 35 Medium (65%), and 6 Hard (11%). This breakdown is strategic. The high concentration of Medium-difficulty problems indicates the interview is a test of consistent, reliable engineering skill rather than academic brilliance. You must demonstrate mastery over core patterns. The 11% Hard questions are typically reserved for distinguishing top candidates or for specific, complex domains. Your primary goal should be to become exceptionally proficient at solving Medium problems under time constraints. The low percentage of Easy questions suggests they are used as warm-ups or screening tools; don't neglect them, but don't build your strategy around them.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a strong emphasis on foundational data manipulation. Prioritize these areas:

- **Array (Top Topic):** Central to almost all data processing. Expect problems involving traversal, partitioning, and two-pointer techniques.
- **String:** Closely linked to Array problems. Focus on parsing, comparison, and sliding window patterns for substrings.
- **Hash Table:** The essential tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, memoization, and validating conditions.
- **Greedy:** Important for optimization problems where local optimal choices lead to a global solution, common in scheduling or resource allocation.
- **Sorting:** Rarely the final answer but a critical preprocessing step. Mastering how to sort custom objects is key.

The most important pattern across Array and String problems is the **Sliding Window**, perfect for finding subarrays/substrings that meet a certain condition. Here is a classic example: finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        # If char is in map and its index is >= left, shrink window
        if ch in char_index and char_index[ch] >= left:
            left = char_index[ch] + 1
        # Update the character's latest index
        char_index[ch] = right
        # Calculate current window length
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const ch = s[right];
    // If char is in map and its index is >= left, shrink window
    if (charIndex.has(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
    }
    // Update the character's latest index
    charIndex.set(ch, right);
    // Calculate current window length
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(right);
        // If char is in map and its index is >= left, shrink window
        if (charIndex.containsKey(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
        }
        // Update the character's latest index
        charIndex.put(ch, right);
        // Calculate current window length
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. This plan assumes 2-3 hours of focused practice per day.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. For each topic, study 2-3 core patterns (e.g., for Array: two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sum). Solve 5-8 curated Easy and Medium problems per pattern. Use a hash table implementation as a warm-up every other day.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed.** Stop solving by topic. Start doing mixed problem sets that combine patterns, like a greedy approach on a sorted array. Time yourself: 25 minutes for Mediums, 45 for Hards. Begin mock interviews to simulate pressure. Revisit problems you solved but couldn't explain perfectly.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Drills and Review.** In the final stretch, solve only Expedia-tagged questions. Cluster them by the patterns you identified. Systematically review every mistake you've made in the previous weeks—this is more valuable than solving new problems. Dedicate time to behavioral preparation and understanding Expedia's business domain (e.g., flights, hotels, pricing).

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Relentlessly.** Expedia evaluates how you think. Narrate your approach, discuss trade-offs between solutions, and clarify constraints before you write a single line of code. A silent coder is a failing coder.
2.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Write clean, modular code with clear variable names. You can mention optimization opportunities ("We could save memory here by..."), but your first working solution should be easy to follow. This demonstrates professional coding habits.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Proactively.** Before declaring a problem solved, verbally run through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicate values. Then, walk through your code with a standard case. This shows systematic thinking.
4.  **Connect to the Business.** When appropriate, briefly note how a pattern might apply at Expedia (e.g., "A sliding window like this could help monitor failed booking requests over a time period"). It shows you think like an engineer on their team.

Mastery of these core patterns and a disciplined, communicative approach will define your success. Start with the fundamentals, pressure-test your skills, and drill down on the problems that matter most.
