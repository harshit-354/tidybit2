When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Salesforce and Cisco, while both established technology giants, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation based on these differences rather than using a generic approach.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant disparity in the sheer number of documented problems. Salesforce's list of **189 questions** is more than double Cisco's **86 questions**. This volume alone suggests that Salesforce's technical screening process may be more extensive or draw from a broader problem bank.

The difficulty distribution also differs meaningfully:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The curve is weighted toward medium and hard problems. With **113 medium** and **49 hard** questions, this indicates that passing a Salesforce interview likely requires strong problem-solving skills under pressure and the ability to handle complex algorithmic challenges. The high number of hard problems is particularly notable.
- **Cisco (E22/M49/H15):** The distribution is more balanced toward foundational and medium-difficulty problems. With only **15 hard** questions documented, Cisco's interviews appear to focus more on assessing solid competency in core concepts rather than solving the most esoteric puzzles.

This suggests that for Cisco, mastering fundamentals is paramount, while for Salesforce, you must also be prepared to tackle tougher, optimization-heavy problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core computer science fundamentals, with **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems being central to both. This is the critical common ground for preparation.

The key differentiator is the fourth most frequent topic for each:

- **Salesforce: Dynamic Programming (DP).** The presence of DP as a top topic aligns with the higher volume of hard questions. DP problems are classic medium-to-hard challenges that test a candidate's ability to break down complex problems and optimize overlapping subproblems.
- **Cisco: Two Pointers.** This is a highly practical and common pattern for solving problems involving arrays or strings, often with a focus on efficiency (O(n) time, O(1) space). Its prominence suggests Cisco interviews frequently involve in-place manipulations, searching, or sliding window techniques.

**Example: A problem might involve finding a pair in a sorted array that sums to a target.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers approach (common for Cisco)
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Hash Table approach (common to both)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers approach (common for Cisco)
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left, right];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Hash Table approach (common to both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers approach (common for Cisco)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left, right};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Hash Table approach (common to both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Cisco first** if you are early in your interview preparation journey. Its focus on core data structures (Array, String, Hash Table) and essential patterns like Two Pointers provides an excellent foundation. Mastering these will allow you to tackle a large portion of Cisco's question bank and build the confidence needed for more difficult problems.

Transition to **Salesforce preparation** after you are consistently solving medium-difficulty problems. Use the core skills you built for Cisco as your base, then layer on dedicated practice for **Dynamic Programming** and a higher volume of challenging problems. The breadth of Salesforce's question list means you should focus on understanding patterns deeply rather than memorizing specific problems.

In summary, Cisco's interview tests for strong fundamentals, while Salesforce's tests for fundamentals _plus_ advanced problem-solving. A logical progression is to solidify your core skills for Cisco, then expand into more complex algorithmic territories for Salesforce.
