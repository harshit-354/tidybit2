When preparing for technical interviews at different companies, understanding their specific question patterns can help you focus your study time effectively. Nutanix and Epam Systems present distinct profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty, and favored topics. This comparison analyzes their interview question data to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Nutanix has a larger overall question pool with 68 documented questions, compared to Epam Systems' 51. More importantly, the difficulty distribution differs significantly.

Nutanix questions are heavily weighted toward medium and hard difficulty:

- **Easy:** 5 questions (E5)
- **Medium:** 46 questions (M46)
- **Hard:** 17 questions (H17)

This indicates Nutanix interviews often involve complex problem-solving and algorithm optimization, expecting candidates to handle challenging scenarios efficiently.

In contrast, Epam Systems focuses more on foundational and intermediate problems:

- **Easy:** 19 questions (E19)
- **Medium:** 30 questions (M30)
- **Hard:** 2 questions (H2)

The minimal number of hard questions suggests Epam's technical screening prioritizes core competency and clean implementation over solving highly complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies frequently test **Array** and **String** manipulation, making these essential areas to master. **Hash Table** is also a common topic for both, underscoring its importance for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

A key difference lies in their secondary focus areas:

- **Nutanix** prominently features **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a fundamental graph/tree traversal algorithm often used in problems involving paths, connectivity, or permutations.
- **Epam Systems** frequently uses **Two Pointers**, a technique common in array and string problems for finding pairs, palindromes, or manipulating data in-place.

This divergence influences the type of problems you'll encounter. Preparing for Nutanix means practicing recursive tree/graph traversals and backtracking. For Epam, you should be comfortable with iterative array scanning and sliding window techniques.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common at Epam) - Reverse a string in-place.
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    s = list(s)
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return ''.join(s)

# Example: DFS (common at Nutanix) - Count paths in a grid.
def count_paths_dfs(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r >= rows or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == 1:
            return 0
        if r == rows-1 and c == cols-1:
            return 1
        return dfs(r+1, c) + dfs(r, c+1)
    return dfs(0, 0)
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Epam) - Reverse a string in-place.
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  const arr = s.split("");
  while (left < right) {
    [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return arr.join("");
}

// Example: DFS (common at Nutanix) - Count paths in a grid.
function countPathsDFS(grid) {
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  function dfs(r, c) {
    if (r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === 1) return 0;
    if (r === rows - 1 && c === cols - 1) return 1;
    return dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1);
  }
  return dfs(0, 0);
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Epam) - Reverse a string in-place.
public String reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return new String(s);
}

// Example: DFS (common at Nutanix) - Count paths in a grid.
public int countPathsDFS(int[][] grid) {
    return dfs(0, 0, grid);
}
private int dfs(int r, int c, int[][] grid) {
    if (r >= grid.length || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == 1) return 0;
    if (r == grid.length - 1 && c == grid[0].length - 1) return 1;
    return dfs(r + 1, c, grid) + dfs(r, c + 1, grid);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both companies, **start with Epam Systems**. Its emphasis on Easy and Medium problems on core data structures (Array, String, Two Pointers) provides a strong foundation. Mastering these will build the fluency needed to tackle Nutanix's more difficult problems. The Two Pointers technique is also generally quicker to learn and implement reliably under pressure.

Once comfortable with Epam's pattern, shift focus to **Nutanix**. Dedicate significant time to mastering Depth-First Search and its applications, along with advanced array and string problems. Practice under time constraints to build the speed and accuracy required for their harder questions.

In summary, use Epam's pattern to solidify your fundamentals, then use Nutanix's pattern to push your problem-solving into more complex domains.
