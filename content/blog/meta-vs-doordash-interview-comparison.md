When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Meta and DoorDash both assess core algorithmic skills, but their approach, volume, and focus differ significantly. Meta’s process is a high-volume test of breadth and foundational mastery, while DoorDash’s is a more concentrated assessment of practical, domain-relevant problem-solving. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Meta’s interview question bank is vast, with 1,387 questions cataloged. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted toward Medium (762 questions) and Easy (414 questions), with a smaller set of Hard (211 questions). This reflects Meta’s typical interview structure, which often involves solving 1-2 coding problems per round across multiple rounds. The high volume means you must prepare for breadth; you are unlikely to see a repeated problem, but you will almost certainly encounter variations on core patterns. Success depends on deeply understanding fundamental algorithms and applying them quickly under pressure.

DoorDash’s question bank is notably smaller, with 87 total questions. The distribution is skewed heavily toward Medium (51 questions) and Hard (30 questions), with very few Easy (6 questions). This indicates their interviews are designed to be challenging and selective from the outset. The lower volume suggests a higher likelihood of encountering a known or similar problem during your interview, making targeted, deep practice on their listed questions highly valuable. The emphasis on Medium and Hard problems points to a focus on complex, real-world scenarios, often involving system design or nuanced edge cases.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** manipulations. These are the absolute fundamentals of algorithmic interviewing.

- **Meta’s** top topics are a classic set: Array, String, Hash Table, and Math. This aligns with a generalist software engineering interview that tests clean, efficient code on common data structures. You can expect problems like two-sum variants, matrix traversals, and string encoding/decoding.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Meta-like: Using hash table for a classic array problem
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Meta-like: Using hash table for a classic array problem
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Meta-like: Using hash table for a classic array problem
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

- **DoorDash’s** list includes **Depth-First Search** as a top topic, replacing Meta’s Math. This is a critical insight. DFS is essential for problems involving trees, graphs, and state-space traversal—common in logistics, mapping, and menu-like hierarchical data (core to DoorDash's business). Expect problems about course schedules, cloning graphs, or traversing a file system.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# DoorDash-like: DFS on a graph (clone graph)
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def cloneGraph(node):
    if not node:
        return None
    cloned = {}

    def dfs(original):
        if original in cloned:
            return cloned[original]
        copy = Node(original.val)
        cloned[original] = copy
        for neighbor in original.neighbors:
            copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
        return copy

    return dfs(node)
```

```javascript
// DoorDash-like: DFS on a graph (clone graph)
function cloneGraph(node) {
  if (!node) return null;
  const cloned = new Map();

  function dfs(original) {
    if (cloned.has(original)) return cloned.get(original);
    const copy = new Node(original.val);
    cloned.set(original, copy);
    for (const neighbor of original.neighbors) {
      copy.neighbors.push(dfs(neighbor));
    }
    return copy;
  }
  return dfs(node);
}
```

```java
// DoorDash-like: DFS on a graph (clone graph)
public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
    if (node == null) return null;
    Map<Node, Node> cloned = new HashMap<>();
    return dfs(node, cloned);
}

private Node dfs(Node original, Map<Node, Node> cloned) {
    if (cloned.containsKey(original)) return cloned.get(original);
    Node copy = new Node(original.val);
    cloned.put(original, copy);
    for (Node neighbor : original.neighbors) {
        copy.neighbors.add(dfs(neighbor, cloned));
    }
    return copy;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Meta first** if you are early in your interview cycle or need to solidify fundamentals. The vast number of Medium-difficulty questions on core topics provides an excellent, broad workout for general interview skills. Mastering Meta's patterns will build a strong foundation that is transferable to almost any other company, including DoorDash.

Prepare for **DoorDash first** if you are interviewing with them imminently or have already built a strong algorithmic base. The smaller, more difficult question set allows for focused, deep preparation. Prioritize their listed problems, with special attention to graph/tree traversal (DFS), array/string manipulations with complex logic, and problems that model real-world logistics or scheduling.

In short: Use Meta to build your general muscle. Use DoorDash to sharpen a specific, practical blade.
