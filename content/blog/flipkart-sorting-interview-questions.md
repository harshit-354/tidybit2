Sorting isn’t just about ordering data—it’s a fundamental tool for solving complex problems efficiently. At Flipkart, with 21 out of 117 questions tagged as Sorting, it’s clear they prioritize this skill. Why? Flipkart deals with massive datasets: product listings, inventory management, customer reviews, delivery logistics, and real-time analytics. Efficient sorting directly impacts search performance, recommendation engines, and operational efficiency. A well-optimized sort can reduce latency in user-facing features and cut computational costs at scale. Mastering sorting algorithms and their applications demonstrates you can handle the data-intensive challenges central to Flipkart’s e-commerce platform.

## What to Expect — types of problems

Flipkart’s sorting questions typically extend beyond implementing basic algorithms. You’ll encounter problems where sorting is the key step to enable an optimal solution. Common patterns include:

1. **Custom Sorting Rules**: Ordering objects based on multiple attributes (e.g., sort products by rating, then price, then recency).
2. **Interval Problems**: Merging overlapping intervals, which often requires sorting by start times.
3. **Greedy Algorithms**: Many greedy approaches, like scheduling or resource allocation, begin with a sorted input.
4. **Search Optimization**: Problems where sorting data first allows efficient searching (e.g., finding pairs with a given difference).
5. **Hybrid Problems**: Combining sorting with other techniques like two-pointer, binary search, or heap operations.

Expect to write clean, production-ready code that handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

## How to Prepare — study tips with one code example

Focus on understanding _when_ to apply sorting, not just how. Start by mastering QuickSort and MergeSort for their optimal average-case and worst-case performances, respectively. Then, learn to identify sorting-based patterns in problems. Practice writing comparator functions for custom sorting in your language of choice.

A key pattern is **sorting to simplify a problem**. For example, the "Merge Intervals" problem is classic: given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping ones. The efficient approach is to sort intervals by their start time, then iterate and merge.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    # Sort by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        if current[0] <= last[1]:  # Overlap
            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])
        else:
            merged.append(current)
    return merged
```

```javascript
function merge(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return [];
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [intervals[0]];
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const current = intervals[i];
    const last = merged[merged.length - 1];
    if (current[0] <= last[1]) {
      last[1] = Math.max(last[1], current[1]);
    } else {
      merged.push(current);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return new int[0][];
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        merged.add(intervals[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] current = intervals[i];
            int[] last = merged.get(merged.size() - 1);
            if (current[0] <= last[1]) {
                last[1] = Math.max(last[1], current[1]);
            } else {
                merged.add(current);
            }
        }
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Build your skills progressively:

1. **Fundamentals**: Implement and analyze standard sorts (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort). Understand time/space complexity.
2. **Basic Applications**: Solve problems involving custom comparators (sort colors, largest number).
3. **Intermediate Patterns**: Tackle interval merging, non-overlapping intervals, and greedy problems (meeting rooms, minimum platforms).
4. **Advanced Hybrids**: Combine sorting with two-pointers (4Sum), heaps (meeting rooms II), or binary search.
5. **Flipkart-specific Practice**: Work through all 21 tagged problems on TidyBit, focusing on clarity and optimization.

Consistency is key. Solve at least one sorting problem daily in the weeks leading to your interview.
