GE Healthcare’s technical interviews for software and data roles are designed to assess practical problem-solving in medical technology contexts. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds focusing on algorithmic proficiency, clean code, and the ability to reason through problems that may simulate data processing or system logic. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our analysis of recent GE Healthcare coding interviews reveals a clear distribution: **40% Easy, 40% Medium, and 20% Hard** questions. This breakdown is strategic. The Easy questions are gatekeepers, testing fundamental coding fluency and attention to detail—failing here is often an immediate rejection. The Medium questions form the core assessment, evaluating your ability to apply standard data structures to slightly novel problems, which mirrors the day-to-day work of building reliable healthcare software. The single Hard question is a differentiator; it’s used to separate very strong candidates from the pack. You can pass the interview by consistently solving the Easy and Medium problems with optimal or near-optimal solutions. The Hard problem is your opportunity to shine, but a partial or brute-force solution here is often acceptable if you’ve excelled elsewhere and can articulate your thought process clearly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are not surprising, but their application might be. Focus your core practice here.

- **Array (30% frequency):** Master in-place operations, sliding window, and prefix sum techniques. These are fundamental for processing streams of sensor or image data.
- **String (25% frequency):** Focus on parsing, validation, and transformation algorithms. Medical data often involves standardized string formats and protocols.
- **Stack (15% frequency):** Essential for parsing nested structures (like configuration files or DSLs), undo/redo logic, and maintaining state in simulations.
- **Simulation (15% frequency:** Directly models system behavior or process flows. The key is writing clean, manageable code to handle state changes and edge cases methodically.
- **Depth-First Search (15% frequency):** Applied to tree or graph traversals, such as navigating directory-like structures or dependency graphs in system components.

The most critical pattern to master is the **Stack-based solution for nested validation**, as it combines String and Stack topics—a common pairing. Here’s the classic bracket validation problem, a fundamental pattern you must know:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:  # Closing bracket
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:  # Opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const mapping = { ")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "[" };

  for (let char of s) {
    if (mapping[char]) {
      // Closing bracket
      const topElement = stack.length ? stack.pop() : "#";
      if (mapping[char] !== topElement) return false;
    } else {
      // Opening bracket
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Character, Character> mapping = Map.of(')', '(', '}', '{', ']', '[');

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (mapping.containsKey(c)) { // Closing bracket
            char topElement = stack.isEmpty() ? '#' : stack.pop();
            if (mapping.get(c) != topElement) return false;
        } else { // Opening bracket
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this time exclusively to the top five topics. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. For each problem, implement the solution in your primary language, then analyze time/space complexity. Do not move on until you can implement standard patterns like two-pointers (Array), stack validation (String/Stack), and iterative DFS from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Difficulty.** Shift to solving mixed-topic problem sets and full Medium-difficulty questions. Simulate 60-minute interview sessions with 2-3 problems. Begin analyzing GE Healthcare’s past questions. Practice articulating your reasoning out loud as you code. This is when you solidify the connection between pattern recognition and clean implementation.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** Conduct at least 4-5 mock interviews with a peer or mentor using platforms like TidyBit. Target Hard problems from the relevant topics, focusing on getting a working solution first, then optimizing. In the final days, review your error log and re-solve problems you previously found challenging. Ensure you can walk through your code line-by-line.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity Over Premature Optimization.** For Easy/Medium questions, a clear, brute-force solution that you can explain is better than a buggy, "optimal" one. State your initial approach, then refine it. Interviewers value correct, maintainable code.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions About Edge Cases.** Before coding, explicitly ask: "Can the input string be empty?" "What should be returned for invalid input?" This demonstrates the thoroughness required for healthcare software, where edge cases can be critical.
3.  **Practice Simulating Processes Verbally.** For Simulation problems, talk through the state variables (e.g., time, queue, resource status) step-by-step before writing a loop. This structures your code and shows systematic thinking.
4.  **If Stuck on Hard, Decompose and Solve a Subproblem.** Don't freeze. Break the problem down. Solve it for a simplified constraint (e.g., a fixed array size, a linear structure). Explain this process. Showing how you tackle complexity is often as valuable as the final solution.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is what will build the reflex needed to succeed. Start with the fundamentals, integrate them under time pressure, and polish your communication.
