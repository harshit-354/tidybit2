When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and style of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Google and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok) are both top-tier tech firms, but their interview landscapes differ significantly in scale and, to a degree, in emphasis. A direct comparison of their tagged questions on platforms like LeetCode reveals clear patterns in volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics, which should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of documented questions. Google's list, with over 2200 questions, is vast and well-established. Its difficulty distribution (E588/M1153/H476) shows a heavy emphasis on **Medium** problems, which form the backbone of their interviews. Hard problems are also well-represented, testing deep algorithmic knowledge and optimization.

In contrast, ByteDance's list is much smaller, with only around 64 questions. Its distribution (E6/M49/H9) is even more skewed toward **Medium** difficulty. This doesn't mean ByteDance interviews are easier; rather, it reflects a newer or more curated question set. The high percentage of Medium problems suggests interviews focus on applying solid fundamentals under pressure, often with a follow-up to optimize a working solution. The lower volume means questions may be recycled more frequently or that the interview process relies heavily on real-time problem-solving beyond a known set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four fundamental areas: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This core overlap is critical and dictates the foundation of your study plan.

- **Arrays & Strings:** Manipulation, two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and sorting-based solutions are universal.
- **Hash Tables:** Used for efficient lookups, frequency counting, and complement searching in problems like Two Sum.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for harder problems, testing optimal substructure and state transition reasoning.

The main difference lies in the application and context. Google's enormous question bank covers these topics in immense depth and variety. ByteDance, with its roots in highly engaging content and real-time systems, may frame these classic algorithms within contexts like feed ranking, video buffering, or concurrent user data, even if the underlying problem is a standard LeetCode pattern.

For example, a classic sliding window problem might appear at both:

```python
# Python: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const set = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;
  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (set.has(s[right])) {
      set.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    set.add(s[right]);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
// Java: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            set.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        set.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

**Start with the shared fundamentals.** The strong topic overlap means a core study plan serves both companies. Master arrays, strings, hash tables, and dynamic programming through high-quality Medium problems. This foundation is non-negotiable.

If you are interviewing with **ByteDance**, you can efficiently target their smaller, Medium-heavy question list after building your core skills. Practice explaining your thought process clearly, as their interviews often involve deep dives into your initial solution.

If you are targeting **Google**, you must prepare for breadth and depth. After mastering the core topics, practice a wider variety of problems, including more Hard questions, from their extensive list. Focus on clean code, multiple solutions, and time/space complexity analysis for every step.

Ultimately, preparing for Google's broader and deeper question set will inherently cover the technical ground needed for ByteDance. The reverse is not true. Therefore, if you have the time, a Google-centric preparation provides the most comprehensive technical base.
