When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas and question patterns is crucial. Microsoft and Adobe, while both requiring strong algorithmic problem-solving skills, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. A strategic preparation plan should account for these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of the question banks associated with each company.

**Microsoft** has a massive, well-documented repository of **1,352 questions**, categorized by difficulty: 379 Easy, 762 Medium, and 211 Hard. This volume indicates a vast pool of potential problems and suggests that interviewers have significant variety to draw from. The distribution (56% Medium, 28% Easy, 16% Hard) highlights a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which often test the core application of data structures and algorithms under moderate constraints. The substantial number of Hards means candidates for senior or specialized roles must be prepared for complex optimization challenges.

**Adobe** has a more focused repository of **227 questions**: 68 Easy, 129 Medium, and 30 Hard. This smaller, more curated set suggests a slightly more predictable interview loop. The difficulty distribution is similar in proportion to Microsoft's (57% Medium, 30% Easy, 13% Hard), with a clear dominance of Medium-level questions. The lower absolute number of Hard questions might indicate a slightly reduced emphasis on extreme algorithmic optimization, though proficiency with Medium problems remains non-negotiable.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are central to both Microsoft and Adobe interviews. These form the bedrock of most coding assessments.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in the next layer of important topics. **Microsoft** prominently lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, signaling that candidates should expect problems involving optimization, memoization, and state transition, which are often found in Medium and Hard questions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

**Adobe**, conversely, highlights **Two Pointers** as a core topic. This points to a focus on problems involving sorted arrays, sliding windows, or in-place manipulations, which are often efficient and elegant solutions to String and Array problems.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Adobe**. Its smaller, highly focused question bank allows you to build core competency efficiently. Mastering the ~227 questions, particularly the 129 Medium problems covering Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Two Pointers, will solidify the foundational skills required for most interviews. This creates a strong platform.

Then, transition to **Microsoft**. Use the established foundation and expand into the larger question pool. The critical addition here is deep practice with **Dynamic Programming**. Tackle Microsoft's Medium questions, which form the bulk of their list, and then selectively practice Hard problems, especially DP variants, to reach the required depth. This sequential approach—foundations first, then scale and specialization—is efficient.
