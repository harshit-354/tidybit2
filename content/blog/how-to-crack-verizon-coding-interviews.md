Getting through Verizon's coding interviews requires focused preparation on a predictable set of data structures and algorithms. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds assessing problem-solving skills, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live coding environment. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, the difficulty distribution for Verizon's coding questions is approximately:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (33%)
- **Medium:** 3 questions (50%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (17%)

This breakdown is crucial for your strategy. The high percentage of Medium questions means your core preparation must be rock-solid. You can expect problems that require a non-obvious insight or a careful implementation of a standard pattern. The single Hard question often tests your ability to combine concepts under pressure. The takeaway: Master Medium-level problems across the key topics, and you'll be well-positioned to handle the majority of the interview.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics in Verizon's coding interviews are Array, Stack (specifically Monotonic Stack), Sorting, and Matrix problems. Here’s how to prioritize them.

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect questions on traversal, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.
- **Stack / Monotonic Stack:** A critical pattern for problems involving finding the next greater/smaller element or maintaining a sorted order in a window. This is a high-yield concept you must practice.
- **Sorting:** Often not the final answer but a key preprocessing step. Understand efficient built-in sorts and when to use custom comparators.
- **Matrix:** Problems involving 2D grid traversal (DFS/BFS), dynamic programming on grids, or rotation/transformation.

The **Monotonic Stack** pattern is particularly important for Verizon. It efficiently solves problems like "Next Greater Element" or "Largest Rectangle in Histogram." Here is a classic implementation for finding the Next Greater Element for each item in an array.

```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # Monotonically decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for i in range(n * 2):  # Handle circular array by iterating twice
        idx = i % n
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[idx]:
            popped_idx = stack.pop()
            result[popped_idx] = nums[idx]
        if i < n:  # Only push indices from the first pass
            stack.append(idx)
    return result

# Example: [3, 8, 4, 1, 2] -> [8, -1, -1, 2, 3]
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // Monotonically decreasing stack (stores indices)

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    // Iterate twice for circular array
    const idx = i % n;
    while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < nums[idx]) {
      const poppedIdx = stack.pop();
      result[poppedIdx] = nums[idx];
    }
    if (i < n) {
      // Only push indices from the first pass
      stack.push(idx);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// Example: [3, 8, 4, 1, 2] -> [8, -1, -1, 2, 3]
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Monotonically decreasing stack

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) { // Handle circular array
        int idx = i % n;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[idx]) {
            int poppedIdx = stack.pop();
            result[poppedIdx] = nums[idx];
        }
        if (i < n) { // Push only during first pass
            stack.push(idx);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
// Example: [3, 8, 4, 1, 2] -> [8, -1, -1, 2, 3]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key. Here is a focused 4-6 week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-3: Deep dive into **Array** patterns (two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sum). Solve 10-15 problems.
- Days 4-7: Master **Stack**, with heavy emphasis on **Monotonic Stack** patterns. Solve all classic problems in this category.
- Days 8-10: Practice **Sorting**-based algorithms and custom comparator usage.
- Days 11-14: Tackle **Matrix** traversal (BFS/DFS) and simple dynamic programming on grids.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Medium Problem Mastery**

- Focus exclusively on **Medium** difficulty problems from the topics above.
- Start timing your sessions (45-60 minutes per problem).
- Begin practicing verbalizing your thought process as you code.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gaps**

- Complete 5-8 mock interviews, simulating the Verizon format.
- Revisit weak areas identified during mocks.
- Dedicate time to understand and practice a few **Hard** problem patterns, but do not make them your primary focus.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Always explain your brute-force approach, then optimize. Verizon interviewers value clear problem-solving logic.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, include edge case checks (empty input, single element), and comment on complex logic.
3.  **Test with Your Own Examples:** Before declaring done, walk through your code with a small sample input, including edge cases.
4.  **Know Your Time & Space Complexity:** Be prepared to state and justify the Big O for your final solution.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the most reliable way to succeed. Target Medium-difficulty problems in Arrays, Stacks, and Matrices.
