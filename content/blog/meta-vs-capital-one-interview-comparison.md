When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial for efficient study. Meta and Capital One, while both assessing core algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty distribution, and strategic preparation paths.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is sheer volume. Meta's question bank is vast, with 1,387 documented questions spanning all difficulty levels. The distribution (414 Easy, 762 Medium, 211 Hard) indicates a strong emphasis on Medium-tier problems, which form the backbone of their typical coding rounds. Preparing for Meta requires broad exposure to a large problem set to minimize the chance of encountering a completely novel question.

In stark contrast, Capital One's catalog is significantly smaller, with only 57 total questions (11 Easy, 36 Medium, 10 Hard). This suggests a more focused and predictable interview loop. The higher proportion of Medium questions aligns with the industry standard for software engineering roles, but the limited pool means thorough mastery of these specific problems is a viable strategy.

**Example: A classic "Two Sum" problem might appear at both, but Meta is more likely to extend it into a "3Sum" or "4Sum II" follow-up.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Meta follow-up: 3Sum
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    res = []
    for i in range(len(nums)-2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        l, r = i+1, len(nums)-1
        while l < r:
            s = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
            if s < 0:
                l += 1
            elif s > 0:
                r -= 1
            else:
                res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])
                while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l+1]:
                    l += 1
                while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r-1]:
                    r -= 1
                l += 1; r -= 1
    return res
```

```javascript
// Capital One core: Two Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Capital One core: Two Sum
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prominently feature **Array, String, Hash Table, and Math** problems. This overlap is good news; mastering these foundational topics serves as a strong base for either interview.

- **Array/String/Hash Table:** These are universal. Expect problems involving sliding windows, two-pointers, and mapping for frequency or indices.
- **Math:** Problems often involve number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation.

The key divergence lies in breadth. Meta's large question bank inevitably covers more advanced topics (e.g., Graphs, Dynamic Programming, System Design for senior roles) beyond the listed core four. Capital One's focused list suggests a tighter scope, potentially staying closer to these fundamental data structures with less frequent forays into advanced graph algorithms or complex DP.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your goals and timeline.

**Prepare for Capital One first if:** You are new to technical interviews or have a shorter timeline. The constrained question set allows for deep, focused practice. You can achieve coverage and build confidence more quickly. Success here solidifies your core algorithmic skills, which are 100% transferable.

**Prepare for Meta first if:** You are interviewing at both, or your primary target is Meta. The depth and breadth required for Meta will inherently cover the scope needed for Capital One. Tackling Meta's Medium and Hard problems will make Capital One's focused set feel like a subset of your preparation. However, this path requires a significant, long-term time investment.

Strategically, building a foundation using Capital One's focused list can be an excellent ramp-up before expanding into Meta's vast problem set. This approach breaks the preparation into manageable phases: first, achieve mastery over a core set of problems, then broaden your exposure to tackle more complex and varied challenges.

Ultimately, your study should be topic-driven, not just question-driven. Drill into each overlapping category (Array, String, Hash Table, Math) with progressive difficulty. This method ensures you develop the problem-solving muscles needed for any variation, whether from Meta's extensive pool or Capital One's curated list.
