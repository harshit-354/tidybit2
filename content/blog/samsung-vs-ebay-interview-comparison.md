When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly increase your efficiency. Samsung and eBay, while both prominent, have distinct technical interview profiles. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in the scale and challenge of their respective question banks.

**Samsung** presents a larger pool with **69 questions**, categorized as 15 Easy, 37 Medium, and 17 Hard. This distribution indicates a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which form the bulk of the assessment. The significant number of Hard questions (nearly 25% of the total) suggests that Samsung's interviews are designed to rigorously test advanced problem-solving and algorithmic optimization, likely for roles involving complex system design or low-level performance considerations.

**eBay** has a slightly smaller set of **60 questions**, with a breakdown of 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard. The focus here is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty problems, which constitute almost two-thirds of the question bank. The proportion of Hard questions is lower than Samsung's, indicating that while eBay's interviews are still challenging, they may place a relatively stronger emphasis on robust implementation and correctness under standard constraints rather than extreme optimization for edge cases.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures, but with different secondary priorities.

The universal core topic is the **Array**, a fundamental structure for both. **Hash Table** is also critical for both, essential for solving problems involving fast lookups, frequency counting, and deduplication.

The key differences lie in their secondary focuses:

- **Samsung** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Two Pointers**. DP questions test the ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems, a skill vital for algorithm optimization. Two Pointers is often used for efficient searching and manipulation in sorted arrays or linked lists. This combination points to an interview style that values algorithmic efficiency and sophisticated pattern application.
- **eBay** shows a high frequency of **String** and **Sorting** problems. String manipulation tests careful indexing, parsing, and sometimes knowledge of language-specific APIs. Sorting is often a prerequisite step or the core of a solution. This focus suggests interviews that assess clean code, attention to detail, and the ability to handle common data processing tasks effectively.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage:
# print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example usage:
// int[] result = twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9);
// System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and the breadth of your foundational knowledge.

If your goal is to build strong, transferable algorithmic skills that will benefit you in interviews at many top-tier companies (including Samsung), **prioritize Samsung's profile**. Mastering its emphasis on Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers, on top of the shared Array and Hash Table fundamentals, will make eBay's focus on Strings and Sorting feel like a manageable subset. This path is more demanding but offers greater overall technical depth.

If you are newer to technical interviews or are specifically targeting eBay, **starting with eBay's pattern is a practical choice**. The slightly lower volume of Hard problems allows you to solidify core competencies in Array, String, and Hash Table manipulation—skills that are universally important. Once confident with these and the included Sorting problems, you can then layer on the more advanced DP and Two Pointer patterns needed for Samsung or similar companies.

Ultimately, a combined strategy is effective: use the common Array and Hash Table problems as your warm-up, then branch out based on your primary target. For dedicated question lists, visit the [Samsung](/company/samsung) and [eBay](/company/ebay) pages on TidyBit.
