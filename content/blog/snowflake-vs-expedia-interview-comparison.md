When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Snowflake and Expedia represent two distinct profiles: a data cloud platform with a heavy emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving, and a global travel platform with a more applied, business-logic-oriented interview process. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Snowflake's interview process is notoriously rigorous, reflected in its larger question bank of 104 questions. The difficulty distribution (E12/M66/H26) shows a clear focus on medium and hard problems, with medium questions constituting nearly two-thirds of the set. This indicates that passing a Snowflake interview typically requires strong proficiency in solving complex algorithmic challenges under pressure.

Expedia's question bank is significantly smaller at 54 questions, with a much different difficulty spread (E13/M35/H6). The presence of only 6 hard questions suggests the technical screen and onsite rounds may place greater weight on foundational understanding, clean code, and problem-solving communication rather than on tackling the most obscure leetcode-hard problems. The higher proportion of easy questions also hints at a potential first-round filter focused on core competencies.

**Key Takeaway:** Snowflake demands deep algorithmic mastery. Expedia tests for solid fundamentals and practical implementation.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** manipulations. These form the essential toolkit for most coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Hash Table for Two-Sum (Common Easy Problem)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Hash Table for Two-Sum (Common Easy Problem)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Hash Table for Two-Sum (Common Easy Problem)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

The key divergence is in their secondary focus areas. Snowflake prominently features **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a staple for tree and graph traversal problems, which often form the basis of their harder questions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS on a Binary Tree
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order processing
    dfs(node.left)
    # In-order processing
    dfs(node.right)
    # Post-order processing
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS on a Binary Tree
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order processing
  dfs(node.left);
  // In-order processing
  dfs(node.right);
  // Post-order processing
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS on a Binary Tree
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Pre-order processing
    dfs(node.left);
    // In-order processing
    dfs(node.right);
    // Post-order processing
}
```

Expedia's standout topic is **Greedy** algorithms. These problems often involve optimization (e.g., scheduling, resource allocation) and align well with real-world travel industry scenarios like booking systems or itinerary planning.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Snowflake first** if you are aiming for top-tier tech companies or have an interview scheduled. Its question set is broader and more difficult, covering a wider range of algorithmic concepts. Successfully preparing for Snowflake will inherently cover the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) needed for Expedia and make its Greedy-focused problems feel like a subset of your skills.

Prepare for **Expedia first** if you are earlier in your interview practice journey or are specifically targeting roles where system design or behavioral fit may carry more weight. You can build strong fundamentals with Expedia's problem set and then scale up to the more challenging depth required for Snowflake, particularly by adding rigorous tree/graph (DFS) practice.

Ultimately, a strong candidate will be well-versed in the common core. Start with the shared foundation of Array, String, and Hash Table problems, then branch out based on your target company's profile.
