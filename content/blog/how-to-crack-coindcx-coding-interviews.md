CoinDCX, one of India's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, builds its platform on robust, high-performance systems. Their coding interviews reflect this, focusing heavily on practical problem-solving and data structure fundamentals to assess a candidate's ability to handle real-world financial data and transactions efficiently. Expect a process that typically includes an online assessment followed by technical rounds where you'll write clean, optimized code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: **4 questions, with 1 Easy (25%) and 3 Medium (75%). Hard questions are absent.** This breakdown is strategic. The single Easy question is a warm-up, testing basic coding fluency and logical thinking. The three Medium questions form the core of the evaluation. CoinDCX is not looking for obscure algorithmic geniuses; they are identifying developers who can **consistently and reliably solve the standard, yet non-trivial, problems** that form the backbone of backend systems, data processing, and API logic. Your success hinges on mastering medium-difficulty problems across their favored domains.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be sharply targeted. Here are the high-probability areas:

- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Essential for optimization problems, like calculating min/max trades or efficient resource allocation. You must recognize when to apply DP and implement both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
- **Database:** Questions often involve SQL queries for data analysis, joins, aggregation, and sometimes schema design, reflecting the data-heavy nature of a trading platform.
- **String:** Manipulation and parsing are common when dealing with transaction logs, user inputs, or data validation. Focus on efficient traversal and pattern matching.
- **Stack:** Crucial for problems involving nested structures, parsing (like validating sequences), and next-greater-element patterns, which can model order book matching or undo/redo features.
- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect problems on subarrays, two-pointer techniques, and in-place modifications, which are analogous to processing time-series data like price feeds.

The most critical pattern to master is **Dynamic Programming for optimization**. A classic example is the "Coin Change" problem (finding the minimum number of coins to make an amount), which directly mirrors financial logic.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    # DP array: min coins for each amount from 0 to 'amount'
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed for amount 0

    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  // DP array: min coins for each amount from 0 to 'amount'
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0; // Base case

  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (coin <= i) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    // DP array: min coins for each amount from 0 to 'amount'
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1); // Use amount+1 as "infinity"
    dp[0] = 0; // Base case

    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin <= i) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Strings, and Stacks. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, focusing on medium difficulty. Implement each solution in your primary language, then re-implement in a second language for syntax familiarity.
**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Databases.** Dive deep into Dynamic Programming. Start with classic problems (Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS) before moving to medium variants. Simultaneously, practice SQL daily. Write queries for filtering, joining multiple tables, subqueries, and window functions.
**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Solve mixed problem sets tagged for CoinDCX or similar fintech companies. Time yourself. In the final week, conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a timer, verbally explaining your thought process as you code.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Then Code.** For Medium problems, brute force is a starting point, not the answer. Immediately discuss time/space complexity and articulate your optimization path (e.g., "This naive O(n²) approach can be improved to O(n log n) with a sort, or to O(n) with a hash map.").
2.  **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases.** Before writing a single line of code, ask about input size, data types, and valid ranges. Proactively state edge cases you'll handle (empty input, negative numbers, large values, duplicate entries). This shows systematic thinking.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with clear functions. Avoid writing a monolithic block. This demonstrates you think about maintainability.
4.  **Practice SQL Out Loud.** You may be asked to write a query in an online editor or simply explain it. Be prepared to walk through your `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `WHERE` clauses logically, as if you were documenting a data pipeline.

Mastering consistent, clean solutions to medium-difficulty problems in these key areas is your direct path to success. Start with the fundamentals, drill the patterns, and simulate the interview environment.
