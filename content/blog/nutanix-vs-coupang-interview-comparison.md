When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are truly tested. Nutanix and Coupang, while both major tech employers, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks. Nutanix, a cloud computing and hyper-converged infrastructure firm, emphasizes system-level thinking and data structures. Coupang, South Korea's e-commerce giant, focuses on scalable, efficient algorithms for handling massive user data and transactions. A direct comparison of their question frequency and topic distribution provides a strategic roadmap for focused preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Nutanix's question bank is larger and slightly more challenging overall. With 68 total questions categorized as 68 questions (E5/M46/H17), it presents a broader set of problems. The higher proportion of Medium (46) and Hard (17) questions suggests interviews often probe deeper into algorithmic optimization and complex data structure manipulation. Expect problems that may involve multi-step logic or require careful state management.

Coupang's set is smaller at 53 questions (E3/M36/H14). It has a lower count of Easy questions, but its Medium and Hard distribution is significant. This indicates that while the total number of _unique_ problem archetypes might be smaller, the interviews are still rigorous, heavily favoring problems that require more than a naive solution. The focus is likely on applying core algorithms to optimize business logic like inventory, logistics, or user sessions.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** fundamentals. This is the critical common ground. Mastering operations on these data structures is non-negotiable for either interview.

**Nutanix's distinctive focus** is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This aligns with problems involving tree/graph traversal, which can model network topologies, file systems, or dependency resolutions—common concepts in infrastructure software.

```python
# Example DFS skeleton (Nutanix-relevant)
def dfs(node, visited):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    # Process node here
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs(neighbor, visited)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS skeleton (Nutanix-relevant)
function dfs(node, visited) {
  if (!node || visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  // Process node here
  for (const neighbor of node.neighbors) {
    dfs(neighbor, visited);
  }
}
```

```java
// Example DFS skeleton (Nutanix-relevant)
public void dfs(Node node, Set<Node> visited) {
    if (node == null || visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    // Process node here
    for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
        dfs(neighbor, visited);
    }
}
```

</div>

**Coupang's distinctive focus** is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is essential for optimization problems—think maximizing efficiency, minimizing cost, or counting ways to arrange items, all highly relevant to e-commerce and logistics.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP skeleton (Coupang-relevant)
def dp_approach(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # State transition relation
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP skeleton (Coupang-relevant)
function dpApproach(n) {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1; // Base case
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    // State transition relation
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP skeleton (Coupang-relevant)
public int dpApproach(int n) {
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // State transition relation
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Coupang first if you are strengthening core algorithmic problem-solving**. Its strong emphasis on DP, combined with the fundamental trio (Array, String, Hash Table), provides a concentrated curriculum that forces mastery of state definition and transition—a skill that transfers to many other companies. The slightly smaller question bank allows for a more targeted deep dive.

Prepare for **Nutanix first if you have a strong grasp of DP and want to broaden into graph-based problems**. The larger question bank and DFS focus require comfort with recursion, tree/graph representations, and cycle detection. This path is excellent if you are interviewing for roles involving systems, networking, or infrastructure.

Ultimately, start with the company whose focus aligns with your weaker area to maximize your study efficiency. The shared foundation in Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables means progress for one directly benefits the other.
