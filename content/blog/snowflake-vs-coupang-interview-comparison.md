When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both Snowflake and Coupang are known for rigorous coding assessments, but their question banks on TidyBit reveal distinct profiles in volume, difficulty, and focus. This comparison analyzes their tagged questions to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers show a significant difference in the size of their known question pools.

**Snowflake** has a larger dataset with **104 questions**, categorized as 12 Easy, 66 Medium, and 26 Hard. This indicates a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which often form the core of their technical screens and on-site interviews. The substantial number of Hard questions suggests that for senior or specialized roles, you should be prepared for complex algorithmic challenges.

**Coupang** has a smaller, but still substantial, set of **53 questions**, with a breakdown of 3 Easy, 36 Medium, and 14 Hard. The distribution is similar in proportion to Snowflake's, with a heavy skew toward Medium problems. However, the smaller total volume might mean that questions are recycled more frequently or that the interview process is more focused on a core set of concepts.

The key takeaway is that both companies prioritize Medium-difficulty questions. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong focus on fundamental data structures, but with a notable divergence in one advanced area.

**Common Core Topics (Array, String, Hash Table):** These form the backbone of interviews at both firms. You must be fluent in manipulating arrays and strings, and using hash tables for efficient lookups and state management. Problems often involve combinations, like using a hash map to track characters in a string or indices in an array.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum using Hash Table
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum using Hash Table
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum using Hash Table
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

**Diverging Advanced Topics:**

- **Snowflake** explicitly lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, indicating a focus on tree and graph traversal problems, which are common in systems dealing with hierarchical or networked data.
- **Coupang** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, signaling that you should expect optimization problems involving overlapping subproblems, which are prevalent in logistics and e-commerce scenarios.

This divergence is critical for targeted study. While both topics could appear at either company, the explicit tagging suggests they are respective favorites.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and interview timeline.

**If you are interviewing with both, start with the common core.** Achieving fluency in Array, String, and Hash Table problems will build a foundation applicable to both interview processes. Practice Medium-difficulty questions relentlessly.

**If Snowflake is your priority,** after the core, dedicate significant time to **Depth-First Search** and its related graph algorithms. Practice iterative and recursive implementations on problems involving binary trees, n-ary trees, and adjacency lists.

**If Coupang is your priority,** shift your advanced focus to **Dynamic Programming**. Master the patterns for 1D and 2D DP, including top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches. Problems related to knapsack, longest common subsequence, or minimum path sum are highly relevant.
