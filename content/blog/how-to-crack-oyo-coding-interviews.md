Oyo’s coding interviews are designed to assess practical problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves 2-3 technical rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often with a system design or project discussion for more senior roles. The questions are generally LeetCode-style, emphasizing real-world applicability over obscure computer science theory.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent Oyo interview questions, the difficulty distribution is clear: **Medium** is king.

- **Easy:** 1 question (13%)
- **Medium:** 6 questions (75%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (13%)

This breakdown is crucial for your preparation strategy. It tells you that Oyo is primarily testing for **strong fundamentals and reliable implementation**. You must be exceptionally proficient with core data structures and standard algorithmic patterns. The single Hard question likely serves as a differentiator for top candidates, but the bulk of the interview—and your primary focus—should be on mastering Medium-level problems. Your goal is to solve these problems correctly, efficiently, and with minimal guidance.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a cohesive set of skills for handling common data manipulation tasks.

- **Array:** The foundational data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place modification, and subarray problems.
- **Two Pointers:** A critical technique for optimizing array and string problems, especially those involving sorted data or searching for pairs.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for applying other techniques like Two Pointers. Know the trade-offs of standard sorting algorithms.
- **Linked List:** Tests your understanding of pointer/reference manipulation, cycle detection, and reversal.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Essential for problems requiring repeated access to the "top K" or "smallest/largest" element, like scheduling or merging sorted streams.

Given that **Array** and **Two Pointers** are top topics, mastering the pattern for finding a pair of elements that meet a condition (e.g., two-sum, container with most water) is vital. Here is a classic Two Pointers implementation in three languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    """Given a 1-indexed sorted array, find two numbers summing to target."""
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # Return 1-based indices
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // Return 1-based indices
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1]; // No solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // Return 1-based indices
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1}; // No solution
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here’s a week-by-week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building**

- **Goal:** Achieve fluency in the top 5 topics.
- **Action:** For each topic (Array, Two Pointers, Sorting, Linked List, Heap), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not memorizing solutions. Implement each solution in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed**

- **Goal:** Learn to combine techniques and improve solving speed.
- **Action:** Tackle problems that mix topics (e.g., using a Heap with Sorting, or Two Pointers on a Linked List). Start timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem). Begin doing 2-3 mock interviews per week.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice and Refinement**

- **Action:** Solve all available Oyo-specific questions. Re-solve problems you initially found difficult. Dedicate time to system design fundamentals if applicable for your role. In the final week, focus on review and mental preparation, not learning new concepts.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** Think out loud. Before you code, state your brute-force approach, then explain your optimization. Ask clarifying questions. This turns the interview into a collaboration and demonstrates your thought process.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First:** A correct, brute-force solution is better than a buggy, optimal one. Write clean, working code first. Then, and only then, discuss and implement optimizations. Use meaningful variable names.
3.  **Test Your Own Code:** Don't wait for the interviewer to find bugs. After writing, walk through a small test case, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). This shows professionalism and attention to detail.
4.  **Know Your Heap Operations:** For your language of choice, memorize the syntax for creating a min/max heap and performing push/pop operations. This saves crucial time during the interview.

Success in Oyo interviews hinges on methodical preparation focused on Medium-difficulty problems across their favored topics. Build the muscle memory for core patterns, practice communicating your reasoning, and you'll be well-prepared.
