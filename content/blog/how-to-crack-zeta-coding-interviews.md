Zeta’s technical interviews are known for their intensity and focus on algorithmic problem-solving. The process typically involves multiple rounds of coding interviews, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or CoderPad, followed by system design and behavioral discussions. Success hinges on a deep, practical understanding of core data structures and the ability to apply advanced patterns under pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 35 recent Zeta coding questions reveals a clear and challenging profile:

- **Easy:** 1 question (3%)
- **Medium:** 22 questions (63%)
- **Hard:** 12 questions (34%)

This distribution is telling. With 97% of questions rated Medium or Hard, Zeta’s interviews are not about checking basic competency. The high volume of Medium problems forms the foundation of the interview—these test your fluency with core algorithms and clean implementation. The significant 34% Hard component is the differentiator. These questions are designed to probe your ability to handle complex scenarios, often requiring a combination of patterns or non-trivial optimizations. You must be prepared to not just solve problems, but to solve difficult ones efficiently and communicate your reasoning clearly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward the most frequently tested areas. Here’s where to concentrate:

- **Array:** Fundamental to most algorithms. Master techniques like two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical area for Hard problems. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in string and sequence problems.
- **String:** Often intertwined with DP and array manipulation. Know pattern matching, palindromes, and subsequence problems cold.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions from O(n²) to O(n). Essential for frequency counting and mapping.
- **Greedy:** Key for optimization problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum. Practice proving your greedy approach.

Given that **Dynamic Programming** is a cornerstone for hard problems, mastering a pattern like the "Longest Common Subsequence" (LCS) is crucial. It’s a classic DP problem that builds intuition for string and sequence comparison.

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    # DP table with (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions, initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                # Characters match, extend the LCS from the previous diagonal
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                # Characters don't match, take the best from left or top
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[m][n]
```

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
  const m = text1.length,
    n = text2.length;
  // DP table with (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions, initialized to 0
  const dp = Array(m + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
        // Characters match, extend the LCS from the previous diagonal
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
      } else {
        // Characters don't match, take the best from left or top
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[m][n];
}
```

```java
public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
    int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();
    // DP table with (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions, initialized to 0
    int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                // Characters match, extend the LCS from the previous diagonal
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                // Characters don't match, take the best from left or top
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 6-Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable given the difficulty curve.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Deep dive into **Array** and **Hash Table**. Solve 15-20 Medium problems covering two-pointers, sliding window, and frequency maps.
- Days 8-14: Tackle **String** and **Greedy** algorithms. Focus on string manipulation, palindromes, and interval scheduling problems. Aim for 15+ Medium problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Mastering Dynamic Programming**

- This is your most important block. Start with classical 1D DP (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs), then move to 2D DP (LCS, Edit Distance, Knapsack).
- Solve at least 20 DP problems, progressively increasing difficulty from Medium to Hard. Focus on memoization and tabulation patterns.

**Weeks 5-5.5: Integration & Hard Problems**

- Start mixing topics. Practice problems that combine patterns, like a sliding window with a hash map or DP on arrays.
- Dedicate at least 50% of this time to **Hard** problems from Zeta’s focus areas. Don’t just code—whiteboard your thought process aloud.

**Week 6: Mock Interviews & Final Review**

- Conduct at least 4-6 timed mock interviews (90 minutes each) with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the real environment.
- Revisit your problem notes and error log. Focus on weak spots in DP and complex array/string problems.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code:** Always restate the problem, ask clarifying questions, and outline your approach (including time/space complexity) before writing a single line of code. Interviewers assess your thought process.
2.  **Optimize Relentlessly:** A brute-force solution is rarely enough. For Medium problems, aim for the optimal solution immediately. For Hard problems, be prepared to discuss the brute-force approach and then iterate toward optimization using DP, advanced data structures, or clever greedy insights.
3.  **Practice Under Time Pressure:** Set a strict 25-30 minute timer per problem during practice. This mirrors the interview pace and trains you to think and code faster.
4.  **Master Your Chosen Language’s Standard Library:** Know the key APIs for collections, sorting, and strings by heart. Fumbling for syntax wastes precious time and breaks your flow.
5.  **Don’t Neglect System Design Basics:** While this post focuses on coding, Zeta often includes system design rounds. Be prepared to discuss scalable architecture for at least one common system (e.g., a URL shortener, a chat system).

Your goal is to make solving a Hard DP or array problem look methodical and calm. Target your preparation, build pattern recognition through volume, and simulate the interview environment until it feels familiar.
