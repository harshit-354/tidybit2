General Motors coding interviews follow a standard software engineering loop: one or two technical rounds focusing on problem-solving and system design, often conducted via platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication—you’re expected to explain your approach as you write. Problems frequently relate to real-world automotive or mobility systems, but the core remains algorithmic.

## By the Numbers — difficulty breakdown and what it means

Based on recent patterns, the difficulty distribution is approximately:

- **Easy**: 10% (1 question)
- **Medium**: 60% (6 questions)
- **Hard**: 30% (3 questions)

This breakdown tells you two things. First, Medium problems are the battleground—mastering these is non-negotiable. They often involve combining two core concepts, like using a hash table to optimize an array traversal. Second, the significant Hard portion (30%) means you must be comfortable with complex problem-solving, typically involving dynamic programming, advanced graph algorithms, or intricate system design. You won’t pass by just solving Easy and Medium questions.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics, in order, are **Array**, **Hash Table**, **Design**, **String**, and **Dynamic Programming**.

**Array**: Often paired with two-pointer or sliding window techniques for optimization. Expect problems about finding subarrays, merging intervals, or in-place modifications.

**Hash Table**: The go-to tool for reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). Used for frequency counting, lookups, and complement searches (like Two Sum).

**Design**: This includes both object-oriented design (e.g., modeling a parking system) and low-level system design (e.g., a key fob authentication service). Focus on clarity, scalability, and trade-offs.

**String**: Manipulation problems are common, often requiring parsing, reversing, or checking properties (palindromes, anagrams). Know your language’s string methods.

**Dynamic Programming**: A critical area for Hard problems. Key patterns include knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on arrays/strings. Practice both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation).

For GM, the most important pattern is **using a hash table to optimize array lookups**, as it appears in both Array and String contexts. Here’s the classic Two Sum implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 week study plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
Focus on Easy and Medium problems for the top five topics. Solve at least 30 problems, prioritizing arrays and hash tables. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter by company and topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Depth**
Tackle Medium-Hard problems. Dedicate time to dynamic programming—start with classic problems (Fibonacci, coin change) before moving to string/array DP. Practice one object-oriented design problem every other day.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews**
Solve complete GM question sets under timed conditions. Simulate the interview environment: explain your thinking aloud, write clean code, and test edge cases. Do 2-3 mock interviews per week, focusing on communication as much as correctness.

## Key Tips

1. **Communicate First**: Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, time/space complexity, and potential edge cases. Interviewers assess your thought process.
2. **Write Production-Ready Code**: Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, large values). Avoid one-letter variables.
3. **Practice System Design Scenarios**: GM often asks design questions related to vehicles or mobility services. Think about state management, APIs, and scalability.
4. **Test Your Code**: After writing, walk through a small test case. This catches off-by-one errors and shows attention to detail.
5. **Know the Automotive Context**: While not required, understanding basics like sensor data streams, telematics, or user authentication in vehicles can help frame your solutions more effectively.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the most reliable path to success. Start with the patterns that appear most often, then build up to the complex problems that will set you apart.
