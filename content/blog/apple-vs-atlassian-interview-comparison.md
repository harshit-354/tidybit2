When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. Apple and Atlassian, while both leaders in their respective domains, present distinct interview landscapes. Apple's process is known for its breadth and depth, heavily emphasizing core algorithmic problem-solving. Atlassian's process, while still rigorous, tends to be more focused on practical application and system design fundamentals, often reflected in a smaller, more curated question set. A strategic preparation plan should account for these differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark contrast in the sheer number of documented problems. Apple's list of **356 questions** dwarfs Atlassian's **62**. This volume indicates Apple's interview process draws from a vast, well-established pool of algorithmic challenges, making "grinding LeetCode" a more central part of preparation.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** The curve is weighted towards **Medium** difficulty, which constitutes about 58% of its questions. This suggests a strong focus on problems that require combining multiple concepts or optimizing beyond a brute-force solution. The healthy number of Hard questions signals that senior or specialized roles will encounter complex algorithmic hurdles.
- **Atlassian (E7/M43/H12):** The distribution is similarly centered on **Medium** difficulty (about 69% of its questions), but the absolute numbers are much lower. This implies Atlassian's question bank is more selective. The lower count of Easy and Hard questions suggests their process may quickly filter for baseline competency before assessing problem-solving on moderately complex, practical problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Apple:** Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
- **Atlassian:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

This high overlap is excellent news for candidates. Mastering these core areas serves as a powerful foundation for both companies. **Arrays and Strings** are ubiquitous. **Hash Tables** are critical for efficient lookups and are the cornerstone of optimal solutions for countless problems. The presence of **Dynamic Programming** in Apple's top four, versus **Sorting** in Atlassian's, is a subtle but telling distinction. It hints that Apple may more frequently delve into advanced optimization paradigms, while Atlassian might emphasize the importance of data organization as a prerequisite for efficient algorithms.

A candidate proficient in these shared topics can solve a significant portion of questions from either company. For example, a problem like "Two Sum" is classic for both:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Atlassian**. Its smaller, focused question set allows you to build core competency efficiently. You can cover a high percentage of their likely question pool in less time, solidifying your skills with Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and Sorting. This creates a strong, confident foundation.

Then, transition to **Apple**. Use the breadth of Apple's question bank to stress-test and deepen your understanding. The larger volume of Medium and Hard problems will force you to apply the core concepts from Atlassian preparation in more complex and varied scenarios, particularly in Dynamic Programming. Preparing for Apple will inherently cover the algorithmic depth needed for Atlassian, but the reverse is not as true.

In summary, treat Atlassian's list as your targeted core syllabus and Apple's as your comprehensive final review. This approach ensures you are well-prepared for the focused practicality of an Atlassian interview and the algorithmic rigor of an Apple interview.
