Getting an offer from Snapchat means passing a rigorous technical interview process focused on algorithmic problem-solving and system design. The coding rounds are LeetCode-style, testing your ability to think under pressure and write clean, efficient code. Understanding what they ask and how to prepare is your first strategic advantage.

## By the Numbers

Snapchat's reported question pool shows a clear emphasis on challenging problems. With 99 questions tracked, the breakdown is 6% Easy, 63% Medium, and 31% Hard. This distribution is telling. While you might encounter a warm-up, the core of your interview will almost certainly be at the Medium level or above. The high percentage of Hard problems (nearly one-third) indicates that Snapchat is willing to push candidates to their limits to assess deep problem-solving and optimization skills. You cannot afford to be comfortable with just the basics. Your preparation must be geared towards solving complex, multi-layered problems within the interview timeframe.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five recurring themes. Master these areas to cover a significant portion of what you'll see.

- **Array:** This is the most fundamental data structure. Expect questions involving in-place manipulations, subarray problems, and sorting tricks. Practice problems that require thinking in terms of pointers, sliding windows, and prefix sums.
- **String:** String manipulation is core to many of Snapchat's features. Be proficient with pattern matching, palindromes, encoding/decoding, and string transformation algorithms. Know your string libraries but be ready to implement logic manually.
- **Hash Table:** Your go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups and managing counts or mappings. It's frequently the key to optimizing a brute-force solution. Use it to track seen elements, frequencies, or to implement caches.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Essential for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, level-order traversals, and problems involving "minimum steps" or "degrees of separation." Be ready to apply BFS on both explicit graphs and implicit state spaces (like a grid or a word ladder).
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** The presence of Hard problems often points to DP. You must be able to identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Focus on classic patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings or arrays. Practice both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.

Let's dive deeper into each topic with practical code examples.

### Array: Sliding Window & Two Pointers

Array problems often require optimizing a solution from O(n²) to O(n). The sliding window technique is perfect for finding a subarray meeting a certain condition (e.g., maximum sum, longest substring with distinct characters). Two pointers are ideal for sorted arrays or in-place manipulations.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (Sliding Window)
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    if len(arr) < k:
        return -1
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum = window_sum + arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum

# Example: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (Two Pointers)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (Sliding Window)
function maxSumSubarray(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return -1;
  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;
  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum + arr[i] - arr[i - k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}

// Example: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (Two Pointers)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (Sliding Window)
public class ArrayExamples {
    public static int maxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length < k) return -1;
        int windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) windowSum += arr[i];
        int maxSum = windowSum;
        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum + arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

    // Example: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (Two Pointers)
    public static int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if (currentSum == target) {
                return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
            } else if (currentSum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

### String: Palindromes & Encoding

String problems test your ability to manipulate sequences of characters efficiently. Common tasks include checking for palindromes (which can be done with two pointers) and basic encoding/decoding, which involves careful parsing and state management.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Check if a string is a palindrome (alphanumeric only)
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

# Example: Run-Length Encoding (Basic Compression)
def run_length_encode(s: str) -> str:
    if not s:
        return ""
    encoded = []
    count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i-1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            encoded.append(f"{count}{s[i-1]}")
            count = 1
    encoded.append(f"{count}{s[-1]}")
    return "".join(encoded)
```

```javascript
// Example: Check if a string is a palindrome (alphanumeric only)
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) left++;
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) right--;
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example: Run-Length Encoding (Basic Compression)
function runLengthEncode(s) {
  if (!s) return "";
  let encoded = "";
  let count = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
    if (i < s.length && s[i] === s[i - 1]) {
      count++;
    } else {
      encoded += count + s[i - 1];
      count = 1;
    }
  }
  return encoded;
}
```

```java
// Example: Check if a string is a palindrome (alphanumeric only)
public class StringExamples {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
            while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
            if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Example: Run-Length Encoding (Basic Compression)
    public static String runLengthEncode(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) return "";
        StringBuilder encoded = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            if (i < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i-1)) {
                count++;
            } else {
                encoded.append(count).append(s.charAt(i-1));
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        return encoded.toString();
    }
}
```

</div>

### Hash Table: Frequency Counting & Mapping

Hash tables (dictionaries, maps, objects) are indispensable for reducing time complexity. The classic pattern is to use a hash table to store element frequencies, enabling O(1) lookups to solve problems like finding duplicates, checking anagrams, or implementing a cache.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string
def first_uniq_char(s: str) -> int:
    freq = {}
    # Build frequency map
    for ch in s:
        freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1
    # Find first character with frequency 1
    for i, ch in enumerate(s):
        if freq[ch] == 1:
            return i
    return -1

# Example: Two Sum (Classic Hash Map solution)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string
function firstUniqChar(s) {
  const freq = new Map();
  // Build frequency map
  for (const ch of s) {
    freq.set(ch, (freq.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Find first character with frequency 1
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (freq.get(s[i]) === 1) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}

// Example: Two Sum (Classic Hash Map solution)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Find the first non-repeating character in a string
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class HashTableExamples {
    public static int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        // Build frequency map
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(ch, freq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        // Find first character with frequency 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (freq.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    // Example: Two Sum (Classic Hash Map solution)
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

### Breadth-First Search (BFS): Shortest Path in a Grid

BFS is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. A common interview scenario is navigating a 2D grid (like a maze or map) where you can move in four directions, and some cells are blocked.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

# Example: Shortest path in a binary matrix (0=passable, 1=blocked)
def shortest_path_binary_matrix(grid):
    if not grid or grid[0][0] == 1:
        return -1
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                  (0, -1),          (0, 1),
                  (1, -1),  (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])  # (row, col, distance)
    grid[0][0] = 1  # Mark as visited
    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        if r == n - 1 and c == n - 1:
            return dist
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
                grid[nr][nc] = 1  # Mark as visited
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: Shortest path in a binary matrix (0=passable, 1=blocked)
function shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid) {
  if (!grid || grid[0][0] === 1) return -1;
  const n = grid.length;
  const directions = [
    [-1, -1],
    [-1, 0],
    [-1, 1],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
    [1, -1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1],
  ];
  const queue = [[0, 0, 1]]; // [row, col, distance]
  grid[0][0] = 1; // Mark as visited
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [r, c, dist] = queue.shift();
    if (r === n - 1 && c === n - 1) return dist;
    for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
      const nr = r + dr,
        nc = c + dc;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < n && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] === 0) {
        queue.push([nr, nc, dist + 1]);
        grid[nr][nc] = 1; // Mark as visited
      }
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: Shortest path in a binary matrix (0=passable, 1=blocked)
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class BFSExamples {
    public static int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid[0][0] == 1) return -1;
        int n = grid.length;
        int[][] directions = {{-1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1},
                              {0, -1},           {0, 1},
                              {1, -1},  {1, 0},  {1, 1}};
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, 1}); // {row, col, distance}
        grid[0][0] = 1; // Mark as visited
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int r = current[0], c = current[1], dist = current[2];
            if (r == n - 1 && c == n - 1) return dist;
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < n && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc, dist + 1});
                    grid[nr][nc] = 1; // Mark as visited
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

### Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci & Climbing Stairs

Dynamic Programming problems can be intimidating. Start with the classic "Climbing Stairs" problem, which is essentially finding the nth Fibonacci number. It perfectly illustrates the concept of overlapping subproblems: the number of ways to reach step `n` depends on the ways to reach steps `n-1` and `n-2`.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci Sequence) - Bottom-Up DP
def climb_stairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

# Optimized version using constant space
def climb_stairs_opt(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    a, b = 1, 2  # ways to reach step 1 and step 2
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

```javascript
// Example: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci Sequence) - Bottom-Up DP
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Optimized version using constant space
function climbStairsOpt(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let a = 1,
    b = 2; // ways to reach step 1 and step 2
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
  return b;
}
```

```java
// Example: Climbing Stairs (Fibonacci Sequence) - Bottom-Up DP
public class DPExamples {
    public static int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }

    // Optimized version using constant space
    public static int climbStairsOpt(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        int a = 1, b = 2; // ways to reach step 1 and step 2
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a + b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy

A targeted 6-week plan is effective. Adjust based on your starting point.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Solidify your understanding of data structures (arrays, strings, hash maps, queues, graphs). Complete 15-20 Medium problems focused on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Ensure you can implement BFS from memory. During this phase, don't just solve problems—analyze time and space complexity for every solution you write. Practice writing the brute-force solution first, then optimize. For example, for a "Two Sum" variant, start with the O(n²) nested loop before implementing the O(n) hash map solution.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Depth.** Dive into Dynamic Programming. Start with classic Medium problems before progressing to Hard. Dedicate time to graph algorithms (BFS/DFS) and more complex array/string problems (e.g., sliding window variants). Begin mixing in Snapchat-tagged problems on LeetCode. A key activity here is "pattern mapping." When you solve a problem, identify its core pattern (e.g., "this is a topological sort problem" or "this uses a monotonic stack"). Create a personal cheat sheet of these patterns and their typical use cases.

**Weeks 5-5.5: Company-Specific & Mock Interviews.** Shift exclusively to solving problems reported from Snapchat interviews. Time yourself strictly. For each problem, also solve a related variant. For instance, if you solve "Word Ladder," also try "Word Ladder II." Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or mentor, simulating the full 45-minute session with communication. Record these mocks if possible to review your thought process and communication clarity.

**Week 6: Review & Polish.** Revisit your mistakes and weak spots. Re-solve problems you initially struggled with without looking at solutions. Focus on internalizing patterns, not memorizing answers. Practice clearly articulating your thought process before coding. In this final week, reduce the number of new problems and focus on depth. For each reviewed problem, write down the key insight that leads to the optimal solution.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Snapchat evaluates how you think. Narrate your initial thoughts, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and explain your code as you write it. Silence is your enemy. A good framework is: 1) Restate the problem in your own words, 2) Ask clarifying questions, 3) Propose a brute-force solution and state its complexity, 4) Propose an optimized solution, 5) Walk through a small example, 6) Write the code while explaining, 7) Test with edge cases.

2.  **Optimize from the Start.** Given the high frequency of Medium/Hard problems, a brute-force solution is rarely the end goal. Think about time and space complexity immediately and state it. Be prepared to optimize further if asked. Often, interviewers will follow up with, "Can we do better?" Have a next-level optimization in mind, even if it involves a more complex data structure like a segment tree or a Union-Find.

3.  **Test Your Own Code.** Never assume your code works. Walk through a small test case, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). This demonstrates thoroughness and debugging skill. Develop a habit of mentally running through these tests before the interviewer asks: null/empty input, single element, sorted vs. unsorted input, duplicate values, negative numbers, and integer overflow (for languages like Java).

4.  **Practice Under Real Conditions.** Use a plain text editor without auto-complete for some practice sessions. Get used to writing syntactically correct code quickly and talking while you do it. Simulate the interview environment: set a timer, turn off notifications, and speak your thoughts out loud as if an interviewer is present. Websites like Pramp or interviewing.io offer realistic practice with peers.

Success in Snapchat's coding interviews comes from targeted, depth-oriented practice on their preferred topics and mastering the performance of solving hard problems aloud. Start with the fundamentals, pressure-test your skills, and communicate clearly.
