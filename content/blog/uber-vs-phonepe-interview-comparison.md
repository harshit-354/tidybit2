When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. Uber and PhonePe, while both prominent in their domains, present distinct interview landscapes. Uber, a global mobility and delivery platform, has a large, well-documented set of interview questions. PhonePe, a leading Indian fintech and payments platform, has a smaller but still substantial question pool. This comparison breaks down their key differences in volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of documented questions. Uber's list of **381 questions** is nearly four times the size of PhonePe's **102 questions**. This volume suggests that Uber's interview process is more standardized and has been analyzed by a larger pool of candidates over a longer period, likely reflecting its longer history as a public, global company.

The difficulty distributions also reveal different hiring bars:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The majority of questions are Medium (224), with a significant number of Hard (103). This indicates a strong emphasis on complex problem-solving. The relatively lower number of Easy questions suggests the initial screening or phone interview stages are quite challenging.
- **PhonePe (E3/M63/H36):** The distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium (63) and Hard (36) difficulties as well, but with a negligible number of Easy questions (3). This points to an interview process that is intensely focused on medium-to-hard algorithmic challenges from the outset, typical of highly competitive product-based roles in India.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures and algorithms, but with subtle priority differences.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming are top topics for both. This is the essential foundation. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays, using hash maps for efficient lookups, and solving complex optimization problems with DP.

**Uber's Additional Emphasis:** String algorithms are a distinct, high-priority topic for Uber. Given Uber's business involves matching text (locations, names), parsing data, and handling communication, this focus is logical. Expect problems involving string manipulation, pattern matching, and parsing.

**PhonePe's Additional Emphasis:** Sorting is a highlighted topic for PhonePe. In fintech, sorting is fundamental for transactions, organizing financial data, leaderboards, and report generation. You should be ready to not just use built-in sorts, but to implement and understand custom comparators and advanced sorting applications.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, focusing on the shared core of Hash Tables:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example
// twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9); // Output: [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and the foundational nature of the topics.

**Start with PhonePe's list if:** You are early in your general algorithm preparation or are specifically targeting Indian product companies. Its smaller, highly concentrated set of **102 mostly Medium/Hard questions** on core topics (Array, DP, Sorting, Hash Table) provides an excellent, focused curriculum. Mastering this list will build a very strong foundation for any interview.

**Start with Uber's list if:** You are preparing for Uber specifically, or for global companies where string manipulation is frequently tested. The **larger volume** of 381 questions offers broader exposure and more practice material. Tackling Uber's list will inherently cover the core topics emphasized by PhonePe, plus give you extra practice on Strings.

In practice, the optimal strategy is to **master the shared core first**. Achieve deep fluency with Arrays, Hash Tables, and Dynamic Programming problems at Medium and Hard levels. This core competency will serve you for both companies. Then, branch out based on your target: drill String problems for Uber, and ensure you can implement and apply advanced sorting logic for PhonePe.
