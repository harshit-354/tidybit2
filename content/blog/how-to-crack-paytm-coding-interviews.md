Paytm’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving skills and coding fundamentals. The process typically involves multiple rounds focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design, with a strong emphasis on writing clean, efficient, and correct code under pressure. Understanding the specific patterns and topics they favor is the fastest way to prepare effectively.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 29 recent Paytm coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 7 Easy (24%), 19 Medium (66%), and 3 Hard (10%). This breakdown is your strategic guide. The overwhelming focus on Medium-difficulty problems means your primary goal is mastering core data structures and common algorithmic patterns to a level where you can implement and adapt them reliably. The few Hard problems often test advanced applications of Dynamic Programming or complex graph manipulations, but securing a strong performance on Medium questions is the key to passing.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-frequency topics. Depth in these areas is more valuable than breadth.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving subarrays, sorting, and in-place manipulations.
- **Two Pointers:** A critical technique for optimizing array and string problems, especially those involving sorted data, palindromes, or pair sums.
- **String:** Problems often involve parsing, validation, and transformations, frequently combined with stack or two-pointer approaches.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A major topic for Medium and Hard questions. You must be comfortable with classic problems (knapsack, LCS) and identifying overlapping subproblems.
- **Stack:** Essential for problems related to parsing, next greater element, and maintaining order (e.g., valid parentheses, histogram area).

The **Two Pointers** pattern is particularly versatile and frequently appears. Here is a classic example: finding a pair in a sorted array that sums to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Master **Array** and **String** operations. Practice in-place algorithms, sliding window, and basic two-pointer problems.
- Days 8-14: Deep dive into **Dynamic Programming**. Start with Fibonacci, climb stairs, and 0/1 knapsack. Progress to medium problems like longest common subsequence and coin change.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Recognition & Practice**

- Days 15-21: Study **Stack** and **Two Pointers** patterns. Solve problems like valid parentheses, next greater element, and container with most water.
- Days 22-28: Begin solving mixed-topic Medium problems from Paytm's question list. Time yourself (45 minutes per problem) and focus on explaining your thought process.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Schedule at least 6-8 mock interviews simulating Paytm's format. Focus on clarity, edge cases, and code correctness.
- Revisit all incorrect or slow solutions from previous weeks. Systematically review the top 5 topics again.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Medium First:** Allocate 70% of your practice time to Medium problems from the core topics. Being consistently strong here is your baseline for success.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code:** Verbally outline your approach, discuss time/space complexity, and mention edge cases before writing a single line of code. Interviewers assess your process.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with proper spacing. Avoid messy, hacky solutions.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases Explicitly:** After writing your code, walk through test cases including empty input, single element, large values, and sorted/reverse-sorted inputs. This demonstrates thoroughness.

Mastering these patterns and executing a disciplined study plan will build the muscle memory needed to perform under interview pressure.
