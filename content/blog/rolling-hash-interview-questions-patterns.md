Rolling hash is a specialized but critical pattern for coding interviews, especially at top tech companies. It transforms string and substring problems from O(n²) brute-force comparisons to O(n) or O(n log n) efficient solutions by using a sliding window with a hash function that can be updated in constant time. If you're interviewing for roles involving text processing, search, or system design, you need this tool in your arsenal.

## Common Patterns

Master these three patterns to handle nearly all rolling hash interview questions.

**1. Fixed-Length Substring Matching (Rabin-Karp)**
This is the classic use case: find a pattern string in a text string. The rolling hash allows you to compare the hash of each text substring to the pattern's hash in O(1), only checking characters when hashes match.

```python
def rabin_karp(text, pattern):
    n, m = len(text), len(pattern)
    if m > n: return -1

    base, mod = 26, 10**9+7
    # Compute hash for pattern and first window
    h_pattern = h_window = 0
    for i in range(m):
        h_pattern = (h_pattern * base + ord(pattern[i])) % mod
        h_window = (h_window * base + ord(text[i])) % mod

    # Highest power for rolling removal
    highest_pow = pow(base, m-1, mod)

    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if h_window == h_pattern and text[i:i+m] == pattern:
            return i
        if i < n - m:
            # Remove leading char, add trailing char
            h_window = ((h_window - ord(text[i]) * highest_pow) * base + ord(text[i+m])) % mod
    return -1
```

```javascript
function rabinKarp(text, pattern) {
  const n = text.length,
    m = pattern.length;
  if (m > n) return -1;

  const base = 26,
    mod = 1e9 + 7;
  let hPattern = 0,
    hWindow = 0;
  let highestPow = 1;

  // Compute hashes and highest power
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    hPattern = (hPattern * base + pattern.charCodeAt(i)) % mod;
    hWindow = (hWindow * base + text.charCodeAt(i)) % mod;
    if (i < m - 1) highestPow = (highestPow * base) % mod;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
    if (hWindow === hPattern && text.substring(i, i + m) === pattern) {
      return i;
    }
    if (i < n - m) {
      // Roll the hash
      hWindow = ((hWindow - text.charCodeAt(i) * highestPow) * base + text.charCodeAt(i + m)) % mod;
      hWindow = (hWindow + mod) % mod; // Ensure non-negative
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
public int rabinKarp(String text, String pattern) {
    int n = text.length(), m = pattern.length();
    if (m > n) return -1;

    int base = 26, mod = 1_000_000_007;
    long hPattern = 0, hWindow = 0;
    long highestPow = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        hPattern = (hPattern * base + pattern.charAt(i)) % mod;
        hWindow = (hWindow * base + text.charAt(i)) % mod;
        if (i < m - 1) highestPow = (highestPow * base) % mod;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
        if (hWindow == hPattern && text.substring(i, i+m).equals(pattern)) {
            return i;
        }
        if (i < n - m) {
            hWindow = ((hWindow - text.charAt(i) * highestPow) * base + text.charAt(i+m)) % mod;
            if (hWindow < 0) hWindow += mod;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**2. Longest Duplicate Substring / Repeated Pattern Search**
Here, you combine rolling hash with binary search. For a candidate length `L`, use a rolling hash to compute all substring hashes of length `L` and store them in a hash set. A collision indicates a duplicate substring.

**3. Sliding Window with Custom Hash Criteria**
Problems may ask for substrings satisfying specific conditions (e.g., containing exactly `k` distinct characters). Use a rolling hash to represent the window's content fingerprint, updating it as the window slides while tracking auxiliary data (like a character count map) to validate matches.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a stark distribution: **Easy: 1 (4%), Medium: 9 (39%), Hard: 13 (57%)**. This split is revealing. Rolling hash is rarely a trivial trick; it's almost always part of a compound solution. The single easy question typically tests basic Rabin-Karp implementation. The medium problems combine rolling hash with another core concept, like binary search or sliding window. The hard majority demand you integrate rolling hash into multi-step algorithms—often involving longest duplicate substring, palindrome handling, or matching under complex constraints. This means interviewers use rolling hash to separate strong candidates who can wield advanced data structures and algorithmic thinking under pressure.

## Which Companies Ask Rolling Hash

This topic is a favorite at companies dealing with large-scale text data, search infrastructure, and system design.

- [Google](/company/google) – For search and substring matching in distributed systems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – In catalog search and DNA sequence analysis (AWS genomics).
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – Financial news text processing and pattern detection.
- [Meta](/company/meta) – Social media content search and plagiarism detection.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) – Document search features in Office and Azure.

## Study Tips

1.  **Implement Rabin-Karp from Memory First.** The rolling update formula `new_hash = ((old_hash - old_char * highest_pow) * base + new_char) % mod` is the engine. Practice deriving and writing it in your language of choice until it's automatic.
2.  **Pair with Binary Search.** For "longest" substring problems, the pattern is binary search on the answer length `L` and use rolling hash to check feasibility for that `L`. This turns O(n²) into O(n log n).
3.  **Handle Collisions Proactively.** In interviews, always mention that hash equality requires a final character-by-character verification to rule out collisions. Discuss using a large prime modulus or double hashing to make collisions astronomically rare.
4.  **Map to a Numerical Fingerprint.** Understand how to convert a substring (e.g., `"abc"`) into a unique integer (`0*26² + 1*26¹ + 2*26⁰` for a=0, b=1, c=2`). This conceptual model is key to adapting the hash for custom constraints.

Mastering rolling hash means you can efficiently solve string matching problems that stump others. It's a high-leverage skill for top-tier interviews.
