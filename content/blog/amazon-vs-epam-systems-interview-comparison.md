When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Amazon and Epam Systems represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of scale, question volume, and interview structure. Amazon's process is famously rigorous and data-driven, with a massive, well-defined question bank. Epam Systems, a global provider of software engineering services, tends to have a more focused and moderate technical assessment. This comparison breaks down their interview question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The difference in question volume is stark and reflects the companies' different hiring scales and processes.

**Amazon** maintains a very large, active repository of **1,938 questions**, as tracked on coding platforms. The difficulty distribution is roughly **27% Easy, 55% Medium, and 18% Hard**. This high volume means you are unlikely to see a repeated question, but you will encounter well-known patterns. The breadth requires a deep understanding of core algorithms and data structures, as the interview is designed to assess problem-solving under pressure and adherence to leadership principles through technical scenarios.

**Epam Systems** has a significantly smaller set of **51 questions**. The distribution is approximately **37% Easy, 59% Medium, and 4% Hard**. This smaller, more manageable pool suggests a greater likelihood of encountering familiar or similar problems during the interview. The focus is heavily on Medium-difficulty questions, testing solid foundational knowledge and practical coding ability, with less emphasis on highly complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with different secondary focuses.

The core overlap is strong in **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are the bedrock of most coding interviews. **Hash Table** usage is also critical for both, often as the key to optimizing solutions for lookups and frequency counting.

```python
# Example: Two Sum (common Hash Table problem)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (common Hash Table problem)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (common Hash Table problem)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

The key divergence is in the next layer of topics. Amazon frequently tests **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a topic that appears in its Hard questions and challenging Mediums. Mastering DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, etc.) is non-negotiable for Amazon. In contrast, Epam's list highlights **Two Pointers** as a primary topic, a technique common for solving array and string problems efficiently (e.g., palindrome checks, sorted array pair sums). While Amazon also uses two pointers, its explicit listing for Epam suggests it's a more guaranteed area of focus.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your timeline and the fundamentals-first principle.

If you are interviewing with **Epam Systems**, start there. The confined question set allows for targeted, efficient preparation. You can thoroughly cover all listed questions, deeply understand the core topics (Array, String, Two Pointers, Hash Table), and build strong confidence. This foundation is perfectly transferable.

You should prepare for **Amazon first only if it is your primary target and your interview is imminent**. The scope is vast. A better strategy for most candidates is to build a robust foundation using a broader curriculum (like "Blind 75" or "NeetCode 150") that covers all common patterns, including DP. This approach inherently prepares you for Epam and creates the strong base needed to then tackle Amazon's volume and difficulty. Practicing Amazon questions last allows you to apply your solidified knowledge to their more complex and varied problems.

Ultimately, master the fundamentals—they are the shared language of both interviews.
