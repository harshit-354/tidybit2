Garmin’s coding interviews focus on practical, applied problem-solving. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds assessing core data structures and algorithms, often through a collaborative coding platform. The emphasis is on writing clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints, reflecting the engineering needs of a company building reliable embedded systems, software, and fitness technology.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear and significant trend: 100% of the cataloged Garmin coding questions are classified as "Easy." With zero Medium or Hard problems in this dataset, the implication for your preparation is straightforward. Garmin’s interviewers are not prioritizing complex, obscure algorithmic puzzles. Instead, they are testing for **foundational mastery** and **coding fluency**.

This means your success hinges on executing fundamental techniques perfectly. You must solve straightforward problems quickly, handle edge cases without prompting, and communicate your thought process clearly. A single off-by-one error or a clumsy brute-force solution on an Easy problem can be more damaging than struggling with a Hard one, as it signals a lack of attention to detail or shaky fundamentals—critical red flags for a company whose products often operate in safety- or performance-sensitive contexts.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics directly inform the types of "Easy" problems you will encounter. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and basic statistics (sum, max/min). You must be comfortable with index manipulation.
- **String:** Focus on character-by-character processing, validation, and basic transformations. Know how to efficiently build or compare strings.
- **Dynamic Programming:** At the Easy level, this almost exclusively means straightforward applications of the Fibonacci sequence or simple 1D DP problems like climbing stairs or finding minimum path costs in a linear structure.
- **Two Pointers:** This is a key pattern for efficient array and string manipulation, especially for problems involving sorted data, palindromes, or removing duplicates in-place.
- **Greedy:** Easy greedy problems often involve making the optimal local choice at each step, such as in activity selection or assigning cookies.

The **Two Pointers** technique is particularly crucial for writing optimal solutions to Easy problems that might otherwise require O(n²) time. A classic example is checking if a string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Move pointers past non-alphanumeric chars
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        # Compare characters (case-insensitive)
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Move pointers past non-alphanumeric chars
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) {
      left++;
    }
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) {
      right--;
    }
    // Compare characters (case-insensitive)
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Move pointers past non-alphanumeric chars
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
            right--;
        }
        // Compare characters (case-insensitive)
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the focus, your plan should prioritize breadth and speed over depth in advanced topics.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Foundations**
Re-solve every Easy problem you can find on TidyBit or similar platforms for **Array** and **String** topics. Do not skip problems that seem trivial. The goal is to build muscle memory and speed. Time yourself.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Drill**
Dedicate blocks of time to the other key topics: **Two Pointers**, **Greedy**, and **Dynamic Programming**. For DP, only focus on the classic 1D Easy problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Min Cost Climbing Stairs). Implement each pattern from scratch multiple times until the template is automatic.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Garmin-Specific Practice**
Conduct at least 5-7 timed mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the real environment: explain your logic aloud, write code on a whiteboard or in a shared editor, and discuss edge cases. In the final week, exclusively practice problems tagged with "Garmin" to acclimate to their specific problem style and difficulty level.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity Over Cleverness.** A bug-free, readable O(n) solution is far better than a theoretically optimal but convoluted one. Use descriptive variable names and add brief comments for complex logic.
2.  **Verbally Validate Your Approach Before Coding.** State the problem in your own words, walk through a small example, and explicitly state your planned algorithm and its time/space complexity. This catches logical errors early and demonstrates communication skill.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Proactively.** Before running your code, verbally test it with empty inputs, single-element inputs, negative numbers, or sorted/unsorted data. Mentioning these shows systematic thinking.
4.  **Know Your Language's Standard Library.** Be able to use essential utilities (e.g., string methods, sorting, basic data structures) without hesitation. Fumbling for syntax wastes time and breaks focus.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** If a problem statement is ambiguous, ask. It's better to spend 30 seconds confirming constraints than 10 minutes solving the wrong problem.

Success in Garmin's coding interview is less about solving the hardest problem and more about solving a straightforward problem impeccably. Solidify your fundamentals, practice clean coding, and you'll be well-prepared.
