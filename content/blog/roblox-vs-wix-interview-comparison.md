When preparing for technical interviews at specific companies, understanding their question patterns is crucial for efficient study. Both Roblox and Wix have a total of 56 tagged questions on TidyBit, but their difficulty distributions and focal topics differ, signaling distinct engineering priorities. This comparison breaks down their profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Both companies present the same total number of questions (56), but the composition by difficulty varies significantly.

**Roblox (E8/M36/H12)** shows a heavy emphasis on **Medium** difficulty problems, which constitute nearly two-thirds of their question pool. The substantial number of **Hard** problems (12) indicates that Roblox interviews likely include complex problem-solving, testing a candidate's ability to handle non-trivial algorithmic challenges, possibly for roles involving game logic, performance, or scalable systems.

**Wix (E16/M31/H9)** has a more balanced entry point, with **Easy** questions making up a larger portion. While **Medium** problems are still the core, the reduced count of **Hard** questions suggests Wix's interviews might prioritize foundational correctness and clean implementation over extreme algorithmic optimization, which aligns with a product-focused web development environment.

This contrast suggests Roblox may have a slightly higher algorithmic bar, while Wix might assess broader implementation skills across a range of complexities.

## Topic Overlap

The core data structure requirements are similar, but with a key divergence.

**Shared Core Topics:** Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** manipulation. These are fundamental to most software engineering roles. You must be proficient in operations like sorting, searching, substring manipulation, and efficient lookups.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Hash Table for frequency count (common to both)
def count_elements(arr):
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    return freq
```

```javascript
// Example: Hash Table for frequency count (common to both)
function countElements(arr) {
  const freq = {};
  for (const num of arr) {
    freq[num] = (freq[num] || 0) + 1;
  }
  return freq;
}
```

```java
// Example: Hash Table for frequency count (common to both)
import java.util.HashMap;

public Map<Integer, Integer> countElements(int[] arr) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : arr) {
        freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freq;
}
```

</div>

**Diverging Topics:** The most notable difference is Roblox's inclusion of **Math** as a top topic, pointing to questions involving number theory, probabilities, or geometric calculations relevant to game development. Wix, conversely, lists **Depth-First Search** as a top topic, indicating a focus on tree or graph traversal problems, which are common in web development for handling DOM trees, site structures, or dependency resolutions.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice should be guided by your target role and interview timeline.

If you are preparing for **game development, engine work, or roles requiring strong numerical logic**, prioritize **Roblox**. Solidify your grasp on array/string algorithms and hash tables, then dedicate significant time to math-based problems and practicing medium-to-hard difficulty questions. The high volume of medium problems means you must be both fast and accurate.

If you are aiming for **front-end, full-stack, or web infrastructure roles**, start with **Wix**. The larger set of easy problems provides a gentler ramp-up. Ensure mastery of the shared core topics (Array, String, Hash Table), then practice DFS patterns for tree and graph problems. The lower proportion of hard questions means you can build confidence across a wider range of problems without initially delving into the most complex algorithms.

For a generalist preparing for both types of companies, begin with the **common core**: drill problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables until you are extremely proficient. This foundation will serve for either company. Then, branch out based on your specific interview schedule: practice Math problems for Roblox or DFS/tree problems for Wix.
