HTC’s technical interviews focus on assessing fundamental problem-solving skills and clean code implementation. While the company’s specific projects may be proprietary, their interview process consistently evaluates core algorithmic thinking through a standard coding round, often conducted on a platform like HackerRank or via a live collaborative editor. Success hinges on methodical preparation and a sharp understanding of foundational data structures.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear, candidate-friendly pattern: a heavy emphasis on **Easy problems (80%)**, a smaller portion of **Medium problems (20%)**, and **no Hard problems (0%)**. This distribution is critical for your strategy.

It means HTC prioritizes **correctness, clarity, and speed** over solving esoteric, complex puzzles. You are expected to flawlessly handle standard algorithmic patterns. The single Medium problem likely serves as a differentiator to separate good candidates from excellent ones. Your goal should be to ace all Easy questions quickly, leaving ample time and mental energy to tackle the Medium problem thoroughly. Missing an edge case on an Easy problem due to rushing is far more damaging than taking extra time to reason through a Medium one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be highly targeted. Master these five areas, which cover the vast majority of past questions.

1.  **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Often the source of the Medium-difficulty question. You must recognize when a problem has overlapping subproblems. Start with the core patterns: Fibonacci-style sequences and 0/1 Knapsack variations.
2.  **Array:** The most common data structure. Expect manipulations involving searching, sorting, subarrays, and in-place operations. Proficiency here is non-negotiable.
3.  **Math:** Problems involving number properties, basic arithmetic, or clever computations (e.g., GCD, LCM, prime checks). These test your analytical thinking more than complex data structures.
4.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Applied to tree and graph traversal. Be ready to implement both recursive and iterative solutions for problems involving paths, connectivity, or searching all possibilities (backtracking).
5.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Essential for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversals in trees. Know when to use a queue-based BFS over DFS.

For HTC, **Dynamic Programming** is the most important topic to master for the Medium-level challenge. The classic "Climbing Stairs" problem exemplifies the core DP pattern of building a solution from smaller subproblems.

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases: 1 way to stay at step 0, 1 way to reach step 1
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    # dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # You can reach step i from step i-1 or step i-2
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]

# Optimized space: you only need the last two values.
def climbStairsOptimized(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    prev, curr = 1, 1  # dp[0], dp[1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
    return curr
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  // dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
  const dp = new Array(n + 1);
  dp[0] = 1;
  dp[1] = 1;

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Optimized space version
function climbStairsOptimized(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  let prev = 1,
    curr = 1; // dp[0], dp[1]
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
  }
  return curr;
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    // dp[i] = number of ways to reach step i
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Optimized space version
public int climbStairsOptimized(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    int prev = 1, curr = 1; // dp[0], dp[1]
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int temp = curr;
        curr = prev + curr;
        prev = temp;
    }
    return curr;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent approach is key. Follow this plan, dedicating 1-2 hours daily.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Master **Array** and **Math** problems. Complete 15-20 Easy problems from each category. Focus on writing bug-free code on the first try.
- Days 8-14: Master **DFS and BFS**. Implement tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order) and graph traversal from memory. Solve 10-15 problems involving islands, pathfinding, or tree depth.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Integration**

- Days 15-28: Conquer **Dynamic Programming**. This is your priority. Follow a structured learning path:
  1.  Memoization (top-down) vs. Tabulation (bottom-up).
  2.  Classic problems: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, 0/1 Knapsack, Coin Change, Longest Common Subsequence.
  3.  Solve at least 2 DP problems daily, starting with Easy, then moving to Medium.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Days 29-35: Take full, timed mock interviews (90 minutes) that mirror HTC's format: 4 Easy, 1 Medium. Use platforms that provide company-specific questions.
- Days 36-42: Review weak areas. Re-solve problems you struggled with. Practice verbalizing your thought process aloud as you code.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** For Easy problems, a straightforward, readable solution is always better than a clever, unreadable one. Write clean code with clear variable names first.
2.  **Communicate Your Process:** Don't code in silence. Explain your approach, mention time/space complexity, and discuss potential edge cases before you start implementing. This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Immediately:** After writing your solution, don't just run the given example. Manually test with small inputs (n=0, n=1, empty array, single element) and large inputs to check for off-by-one errors.
4.  **Practice Time Management:** Allocate your 90 minutes wisely. Budget ~10 minutes per Easy problem (40 minutes total) and dedicate the remaining 50 minutes to understanding, solving, and testing the Medium problem.

Targeted, consistent practice on these core topics will make you exceptionally well-prepared for HTC's coding interview. Start with the fundamentals, drill the patterns, and simulate the real environment.
