Hilabs is known for a rigorous technical interview process that leans heavily on algorithmic problem-solving. While specific details evolve, their coding rounds consistently test fundamentals applied to complex scenarios. Based on recent patterns, success requires targeted preparation around a distinct set of high-weight topics.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear and challenging profile: approximately 33% Easy, 0% Medium, and 67% Hard questions. This distribution is atypical. Most companies use a gradient of difficulty. Hilabs's pattern suggests they use simpler problems as a rapid filter before presenting significant, multi-layered challenges. The absence of Medium questions indicates a sharp jump. You must solve the Easy problem flawlessly and quickly to conserve mental energy for the one or two Hard problems that will likely determine your outcome. This structure tests not just depth of knowledge, but also stamina, strategic problem decomposition, and the ability to perform under pressure after an intense start.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study must be highly concentrated. The top topics—String, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation/Bitmask, and Math—are not equally weighted. DP and Bitmask often form the core of Hard problems, while String and Math concepts are frequently woven into them.

- **Dynamic Programming:** The cornerstone of Hard problems. You must master both 1D/2D tabulation and memoization, especially for state-dependent decisions. Pattern: DP where the state includes a bitmask.
- **Bit Manipulation & Bitmask:** Frequently combined with DP for problems involving subsets, permutations, or visited states (e.g., traveling salesman, assignment problems). Core skill: using integers to represent sets.
- **String:** Often the vehicle for DP problems (e.g., edit distance, palindrome partitioning, wildcard matching) or for implementing bitwise algorithms.
- **Math:** Underpins many optimizations, especially in counting, combinatorics, or number theory aspects of DP/bitmask problems.

The most critical combined pattern is **DP with Bitmask**. Here is a classic example: counting the number of ways to assign unique hats to people (the "Assign Hats" or "Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats" problem). The bitmask represents which people have already received a hat.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def numberWays(hats):
    from collections import defaultdict
    # hats: List[List[int]] - hats[i] is list of hats person i likes
    n = len(hats)  # number of people
    hat_to_people = defaultdict(list)
    # Convert to map: hat -> [people who like it]
    for person, hat_list in enumerate(hats):
        for h in hat_list:
            hat_to_people[h].append(person)

    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # dp[mask] = ways to assign hats considered so far to achieve assignment state 'mask'
    dp = [0] * (1 << n)
    dp[0] = 1  # empty assignment

    # Iterate over hats 1..40
    for hat in range(1, 41):
        if hat not in hat_to_people:
            continue
        # Iterate current states backwards to avoid overwriting
        for mask in range((1 << n) - 1, -1, -1):
            if dp[mask] == 0:
                continue
            # Try assigning this hat to each person who likes it and is not yet assigned
            for person in hat_to_people[hat]:
                if not (mask >> person) & 1:  # person not assigned yet
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << person)
                    dp[new_mask] = (dp[new_mask] + dp[mask]) % MOD
    # Answer: all people assigned (mask with all n bits set)
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1]
```

```javascript
function numberWays(hats) {
  const n = hats.length;
  const hatToPeople = new Map();
  // Build map: hat -> [people]
  for (let person = 0; person < n; person++) {
    for (const h of hats[person]) {
      if (!hatToPeople.has(h)) hatToPeople.set(h, []);
      hatToPeople.get(h).push(person);
    }
  }
  const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
  const dp = new Array(1 << n).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  // Iterate over possible hats
  for (let hat = 1; hat <= 40; hat++) {
    if (!hatToPeople.has(hat)) continue;
    const peopleList = hatToPeople.get(hat);
    // Iterate backwards over states
    for (let mask = (1 << n) - 1; mask >= 0; mask--) {
      if (dp[mask] === 0) continue;
      for (const person of peopleList) {
        if ((mask >> person) & 1) continue; // person already has hat
        const newMask = mask | (1 << person);
        dp[newMask] = (dp[newMask] + dp[mask]) % MOD;
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}
```

```java
public int numberWays(List<List<Integer>> hats) {
    int n = hats.size();
    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hatToPeople = new HashMap<>();
    // Build map: hat -> list of people
    for (int person = 0; person < n; person++) {
        for (int h : hats.get(person)) {
            hatToPeople.computeIfAbsent(h, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(person);
        }
    }
    final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    int[] dp = new int[1 << n];
    dp[0] = 1;
    // Iterate over hats 1..40
    for (int hat = 1; hat <= 40; hat++) {
        if (!hatToPeople.containsKey(hat)) continue;
        List<Integer> peopleList = hatToPeople.get(hat);
        // Iterate states backwards
        for (int mask = (1 << n) - 1; mask >= 0; mask--) {
            if (dp[mask] == 0) continue;
            for (int person : peopleList) {
                if (((mask >> person) & 1) == 1) continue; // person already assigned
                int newMask = mask | (1 << person);
                dp[newMask] = (dp[newMask] + dp[mask]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the high difficulty, a focused 6-week plan is recommended.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Master String algorithms (palindromes, subsequences, sliding window) and essential Math (GCD, modulo, combinatorics). Deeply study Bit Manipulation fundamentals: operations, tricks, and simple subset generation using bitmasks.

**Weeks 3-4: Dynamic Programming Mastery.** Dedicate two full weeks to DP. Start with classical problems (knapsack, LCS, LIS). Progress to harder variants, specifically focusing on DP with 2D states and, crucially, DP with bitmask state. Solve every relevant DP-bitmask problem you can find.

**Weeks 5-5.5: Integration & Company-Specific Practice.** Solve only Hard problems that combine the core topics. For example, "String transformation with DP and bitmask" or "Math counting with DP." Use the Hilabs-tagged question bank to simulate their style.

**Week 6: Mock Interviews & Refinement.** Conduct timed mock interviews with the 1 Easy + 2 Hard format. Practice clearly explaining your thought process for complex DP solutions under time pressure. Review bitwise operation syntax in your chosen language until it's automatic.

## Key Tips

1.  **Ace the Easy Problem Instantly.** The first question is your warm-up. Practice easy String/Math problems to build speed and guarantee a perfect, bug-free solve in under 10 minutes. This buys you time for the real battle.
2.  **Think "State Machine" for Hard Problems.** When you see a Hard problem, immediately ask: "Can this be modeled with Dynamic Programming? What defines the state?" If you see constraints like `n <= 15` or `20`, a bitmask representing a subset or visited set is a prime candidate for part of the DP state.
3.  **Write the Recurrence Before Code.** For DP problems, verbally state and write down the recurrence relation (`dp[state] = f(other states)`) on your whiteboard. This clarifies your logic and makes coding a direct translation, reducing errors in complex loops.
4.  **Test with Small Bitmask Values.** When debugging a bitmask solution, manually calculate the bitmask for tiny examples (e.g., 3 people) to verify your `<<`, `&`, `|` logic is correct before running code.

Success at Hilabs requires moving beyond standard patterns to their advanced synthesis. Focus your energy on DP and bitmask mastery, and structure your practice to match their demanding format.
