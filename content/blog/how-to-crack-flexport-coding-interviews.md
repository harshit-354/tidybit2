Flexport’s coding interviews are designed to assess your ability to solve practical, data-intensive problems that mirror their work in global logistics and supply chain management. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like CoderPad or Zoom. Expect questions that test your grasp of core data structures and efficient manipulation of real-world datasets.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Flexport interview questions reveals a clear pattern: **100% of the problems are rated at Medium difficulty**. There are no Easy or Hard problems in the typical set. This tells you exactly what to expect: you will not be asked trivial array traversals, nor will you face obscure, complex graph algorithms requiring advanced DP states. Instead, you will encounter well-defined, non-trivial problems that require a solid, methodical application of standard algorithms and data structures to achieve optimal efficiency. The focus is on consistent, reliable execution under moderate complexity—precisely the skill needed for building robust systems that handle real-world logistics data.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows five dominant topics. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

**Array**
Fundamental to almost all data processing; expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sorting, and merging intervals.
**Hash Table**
The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity, frequently used in tandem with arrays for problems involving pairs, duplicates, or counts.
**Binary Search**
Applied not just on sorted arrays, but on answer spaces for optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum capacity to ship packages within D days").
**String**
Often involves parsing, comparison, and transformation, testing careful handling of edge cases and indices.
**Sliding Window**
A critical pattern for optimizing problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings to meet a certain condition.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is particularly powerful for Flexport-style problems that might involve analyzing contiguous time windows in shipment data or finding optimal segments. Here is a template for the variable-size window pattern, used in problems like "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters":

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char is seen and its index is within the current window
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1  # Shrink window from the left
        char_index[char] = right  # Update latest index
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is essential given the narrow difficulty band and clear topic focus.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Spend the first two weeks intensively covering the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, Binary Search, String, Sliding Window), solve 8-10 curated Medium problems. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern for each problem type. For example, for Binary Search, practice both the classic search and its application on answer spaces (like "Koko Eating Bananas").

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Problems will combine patterns. Practice problems that mix Hash Tables with Arrays (e.g., Two Sum variants) or Sliding Window with Strings. Complete 2-3 full 60-minute mock interview sessions per week, using a timer and a platform like CoderPad. Simulate the real environment by talking through your thought process.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Refinement**
In the final stretch, focus exclusively on Flexport’s known question list and similar problems from other logistics/backend-focused companies. Re-solve any problems you struggled with in the first phase. Dedicate time to internalizing the sliding window and binary search templates until you can write them flawlessly under pressure.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Then Code.** Flexport’s Medium problems almost always have a brute-force solution and an optimal one. Clearly articulate the O(n²) approach, then immediately state you can improve it using a Hash Table or Sliding Window to O(n). This demonstrates systematic thinking.
2.  **Clarify Data Characteristics.** Before coding, ask: Is the array sorted? Can it contain duplicates? What is the expected input size? This mirrors real-world data validation and shows you’re thinking about edge cases relevant to logistics data.
3.  **Use Meaningful Variable Names.** Instead of `i`, `j`, `map`, use names like `left`, `right`, `charIndexMap` or `shipmentCount`. This makes your logic easier to follow and signals you write production-ready code.
4.  **Practice Verbalizing Trade-offs.** Be prepared to discuss the memory trade-off for using a Hash Table or the pre-requisite of sorting for a two-pointer approach. Interviewers assess your ability to reason about system constraints.

Success in a Flexport interview hinges on disciplined practice of Medium-difficulty problems across their core topics. Build fluency in the patterns, and you’ll be able to structure efficient solutions for their data-centric challenges.
