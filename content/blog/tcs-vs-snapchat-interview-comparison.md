When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and Snapchat represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum—one a global IT services giant and the other a product-focused social media company. Their interview questions reflect their different business models, engineering needs, and hiring bars. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a stark contrast in both the number of questions and their difficulty breakdown.

**TCS** has a large, publicly available pool of **217 questions**. The difficulty distribution is heavily skewed towards easier problems: **94 Easy (E)**, **103 Medium (M)**, and only **20 Hard (H)**. This high volume, particularly of Easy and Medium questions, suggests that TCS interviews may focus on assessing strong foundational knowledge and consistent problem-solving ability across a wide range of standard topics. The goal is likely to filter for competent, reliable engineers who can handle varied development tasks.

**Snapchat** has a more curated pool of **99 questions**. The distribution is heavily concentrated on Medium and Hard problems: **6 Easy**, **62 Medium**, and **31 Hard**. This indicates a significantly higher bar for algorithmic complexity and optimization. Snapchat interviews are designed to identify engineers capable of tackling the nuanced performance, scalability, and systems challenges inherent in a fast-moving consumer tech product with millions of users.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These are fundamental data structures that form the basis for most algorithmic questions. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator lies in their secondary focus areas:

- **TCS** prominently features **Two Pointers**. This is a classic technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists (e.g., finding a pair with a target sum, removing duplicates). It's a clean, efficient pattern that tests a candidate's ability to manipulate indices and reason about in-place operations.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

- **Snapchat** places a strong emphasis on **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS is essential for solving shortest path problems, level-order traversals, and problems involving exploration or spreading processes (highly relevant for social networks). This signals that Snapchat values graph theory knowledge and the ability to reason about relationships and networks.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# BFS: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
from collections import deque
def levelOrder(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

```javascript
// BFS: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
function levelOrder(root) {
  if (!root) return [];
  const result = [];
  const queue = [root];
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    const level = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      level.push(node.val);
      if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
      if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
    }
    result.push(level);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
// BFS: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null) return result;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int levelSize = queue.size();
        List<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode node = queue.poll();
            level.add(node.val);
            if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
            if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
        }
        result.add(level);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your target role and current skill level.

**Prepare for TCS first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting IT services/consultancy roles. The large pool of foundational Easy/Medium problems on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Two Pointers provides excellent practice for solidifying core data structure and algorithm knowledge. Succeeding here builds the confidence needed to tackle more difficult problems.

**Prepare for Snapchat first if:** You are aiming for competitive product-based tech companies (FAANG+). While the question pool is smaller, the high concentration of Medium and Hard problems, especially those involving BFS and graphs, demands deeper mastery. Preparing for this higher bar will make TCS-style questions feel more manageable. Focus on mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) to an advanced level, then drill deeply into graph algorithms, BFS/DFS, and dynamic programming.

In essence, TCS preparation builds a broad, strong foundation. Snapchat preparation requires building specialized depth on top of that foundation. Start with the one that aligns with your immediate career target and use it as a stepping stone.
