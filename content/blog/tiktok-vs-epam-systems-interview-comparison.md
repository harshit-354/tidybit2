When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. TikTok and Epam Systems represent two distinct ends of the software interview spectrum: one is a fast-paced, product-driven tech giant, and the other is a large-scale global engineering services provider. A direct comparison of their publicly listed coding interview questions reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis, which should guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of questions associated with each company is the most striking difference. TikTok's list contains **383 questions**, dwarfing Epam Systems' **51 questions**. This volume suggests that TikTok's interview process is highly scrutinized by candidates, with many problems being frequently reported across numerous interviews.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different hiring bars:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The interview process is heavily weighted toward **Medium and Hard problems**. With 260 Medium and 81 Hard questions, this indicates a strong emphasis on algorithmic depth and complex problem-solving. You must be prepared for multi-step reasoning and optimization.
- **Epam Systems (E19/M30/H2):** The distribution is more balanced toward **Easy and Medium problems**. With only 2 Hard questions reported, the focus is likely on assessing solid foundational knowledge, clean code, and practical implementation skills rather than solving obscure algorithmic puzzles.

This contrast suggests TikTok is filtering for top-tier algorithmic performance, while Epam is evaluating core engineering competency.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with different depths.

**Core Shared Topics:** `Array`, `String`, and `Hash Table` are prominent for both. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures. For example, a classic two-pointer technique on an array is essential knowledge for either company.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers: Move zeroes to the end (relevant to both)
def moveZeroes(nums):
    insert_pos = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            nums[insert_pos], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[insert_pos]
            insert_pos += 1
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers: Move zeroes to the end (relevant to both)
function moveZeroes(nums) {
  let insertPos = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== 0) {
      [nums[insertPos], nums[i]] = [nums[i], nums[insertPos]];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers: Move zeroes to the end (relevant to both)
public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
    int insertPos = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != 0) {
            int temp = nums[insertPos];
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            nums[i] = temp;
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
}
```

</div>

**Key Differentiators:**

- **TikTok's Standout:** `Dynamic Programming (DP)` is a major topic. Mastering DP patterns (knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.) is non-negotiable for TikTok interviews.
- **Epam's Focus:** `Two Pointers` is explicitly listed as a top topic, indicating a practical focus on in-place array/string manipulation and efficiency.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and timeline.

**Prepare for Epam Systems first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting roles that value robust, maintainable code over cutting-edge algorithm optimization. The smaller question bank and lower difficulty ceiling make it a more manageable first goal. Mastering the shared fundamentals (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables) and Two Pointers will build a strong foundation that is also applicable to TikTok.

**Prepare for TikTok first if:** You are aiming for high-performance engineering or algorithm-focused roles, or if you have an interview scheduled. The depth required (especially in Dynamic Programming) demands significant, dedicated practice. Successfully preparing for TikTok's rigorous standard will inherently cover the core topics needed for Epam Systems and most other companies. However, this path requires a greater time investment.

In summary, use Epam's list to solidify your fundamentals and TikTok's list to push your algorithmic problem-solving to a competitive level. Master the shared core topics first, then branch into each company's specialties.
