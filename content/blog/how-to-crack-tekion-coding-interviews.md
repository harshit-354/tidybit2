Tekion’s technical interview process is designed to assess strong foundational data structures and algorithms skills, often through a series of coding rounds focused on problem-solving. The questions are typically medium difficulty, requiring not just a working solution but clean, efficient code and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing a sample of 23 Tekion questions reveals a clear pattern: **70% (16 questions) are of Medium difficulty**. Easy questions make up only 9% (2 questions), while Hard questions account for 22% (5 questions). This distribution is critical for your preparation strategy. It means you must become exceptionally proficient at solving medium-level problems within a 30-45 minute timeframe. The focus is on reliable, optimal solutions to common patterns, not on obscure algorithms or extreme optimization. Expect to be pushed on edge cases and time/space complexity.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Dynamic Programming, Hash Table, String, and Two Pointers. Mastering these areas will cover the vast majority of problems you'll encounter.

- **Array & Two Pointers:** Often combined. The sliding window and two-pointer techniques are fundamental for solving subarray and substring problems efficiently.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A core topic for Tekion, especially for medium-hard problems. Focus on classic patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings or arrays.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity, frequently used in conjunction with arrays and strings for problems involving counts, pairs, or duplicates.
- **String:** Manipulation and pattern matching are common. Be comfortable with techniques like reversing, parsing, and using hash maps or two pointers for anagrams/palindromes.

The most important pattern to master is the **Sliding Window** technique, as it elegantly solves a wide range of array/string problems. Here’s a classic example: finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charSet = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (charSet.has(s[right])) {
      charSet.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    charSet.add(s[right]);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan:

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, String, Two Pointers, DP), solve 15-20 curated medium problems. Understand the underlying pattern of each solution. Don't just solve—memorize the approach.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Start mixing problems from all topics. Focus on recognizing which pattern applies to a new problem within the first 2-3 minutes of reading it. Begin doing timed practice sessions (45 minutes per problem) and participate in mock interviews to simulate pressure.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Review**
In the final stretch, solve only Tekion-tagged questions. Revisit all problems you struggled with in the first four weeks. Ensure you can verbally walk through your reasoning and complexity analysis for any solution you've written.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Always state your brute-force idea and its complexity first, then explain your plan for optimization. This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, include clear comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values) explicitly before you start coding the main logic.
3.  **Practice the "Medium" Pace:** Your goal is a bug-free, optimal solution for a medium problem in 25-30 minutes, leaving 10-15 minutes for discussion. This pace comes only from consistent timed practice.
4.  **Master One Language Deeply:** Use a single language for all your practice. Know its standard library for collections (like `HashMap`, `Set`, `List`) inside out to avoid wasting time during the interview.

Success in Tekion interviews hinges on methodical preparation focused on medium-difficulty problems across a predictable set of topics. Build pattern recognition through volume, then refine it through timed practice and clear communication.
