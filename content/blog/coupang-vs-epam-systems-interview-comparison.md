When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of your target company can dramatically increase your efficiency. Coupang and Epam Systems, while both testing core data structures and algorithms, show distinct differences in their question profiles that directly inform preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of reported questions is nearly identical (Coupang: 53, Epam: 51), but the difficulty distribution reveals a key strategic difference.

**Coupang** has a significant portion of **Hard** questions (14 out of 53, or ~26%). This indicates that for roles at their E3/M36 level, they expect candidates to tackle complex algorithmic challenges. The presence of these Hard problems, often involving optimization or nuanced Dynamic Programming, suggests they are testing for deep problem-solving ability and technical mastery under pressure.

**Epam Systems** has a vastly different distribution, with a heavy emphasis on **Easy** questions (19 out of 51, or ~37%) and very few **Hard** ones (only 2, or ~4%). This profile is more typical of companies assessing strong foundational knowledge, clean code, and the ability to reason through straightforward problems correctly and efficiently. The interview likely focuses on implementation skill and logical clarity over solving the most esoteric algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, which are fundamental to most coding interviews. **Hash Table** is also a common key topic for both, essential for optimizing lookups and solving frequency-counting problems.

The critical divergence is in their secondary focus areas:

- **Coupang** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with their higher frequency of Hard questions, as DP is a common source of complex problems involving optimization, memoization, and state transition.
- **Epam Systems** prominently features **Two Pointers**. This technique is often used for solving medium-difficulty problems on sorted arrays or strings (e.g., finding pairs, removing duplicates, checking palindromes) and emphasizes logical traversal patterns.

Here is a typical problem that highlights Coupang's DP focus versus Epam's Two Pointers focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Coupang-style DP Problem: House Robber
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, len(nums) + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])
    return dp[-1]

# Epam-style Two Pointers Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
// Coupang-style DP Problem: House Robber
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = nums[0];
  for (let i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1]);
  }
  return dp[nums.length];
}

// Epam-style Two Pointers Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
// Coupang-style DP Problem: House Robber
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length + 1];
    dp[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[nums.length];
}

// Epam-style Two Pointers Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i-1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by the company's difficulty curve.

**Prepare for Epam Systems first if you are early in your interview practice.** Their emphasis on Easy and Medium problems on core topics like Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers provides an excellent foundation. Mastering these will build confidence and ensure you can write bug-free, efficient code for common problems—a skill that transfers to any interview.

**Prepare for Coupang only after solidifying your fundamentals.** Their question set requires you to then layer on advanced topics, specifically **Dynamic Programming**. You must dedicate significant time to understanding DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.) and practicing complex problem variations. Attempting Coupang's profile without this dedicated study will be challenging due to the high density of Hard problems.

In summary, Epam's interview tests for strong coding fundamentals and clarity, while Coupang's tests for advanced algorithmic prowess and optimization. Build your foundation with Epam's pattern, then specialize for Coupang's depth.
