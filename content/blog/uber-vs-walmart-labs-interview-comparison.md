When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. Uber and Walmart Labs are two prominent employers with distinct engineering cultures and product domains—Uber in mobility and logistics, and Walmart Labs in large-scale e-commerce and retail technology. A comparison of their interview question profiles reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty, and emphasis, which should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of questions associated with each company. Uber's profile, with 381 questions, is more than double that of Walmart Labs' 152. This suggests a more extensive and perhaps more widely discussed interview history in the public domain for Uber.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty (224), but there is a substantial pool of Hard questions (103). This indicates that while you must be proficient with standard algorithms, you should also be prepared for complex problem-solving and optimization challenges.
- **Walmart Labs (E22/M105/H25):** The distribution is also Medium-heavy (105), but the number of Hard questions is significantly lower (25). The emphasis appears to be more on solid, reliable application of core concepts rather than on solving the most esoteric algorithmic puzzles.

This data implies that for Uber, you must budget time to tackle a higher number of potentially complex problems. For Walmart Labs, depth of understanding on fundamental, medium-difficulty problems is paramount.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a nearly identical core set of data structures and algorithms. The top four topics for both are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**, though in slightly different orders. This overlap is excellent news for candidates, as mastering these areas serves a dual purpose.

- **Arrays and Strings** are the bedrock of most coding problems. Expect questions involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and string manipulation.
- **Hash Tables** are critical for efficient lookups and are often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Dynamic Programming** is a staple for interviews assessing problem decomposition and optimization. While challenging, its presence in both lists means you cannot afford to skip it.

The main difference lies in the _application_ of these topics. Uber's problems in logistics and mapping might more frequently involve graph algorithms (like BFS/DFS or shortest path) disguised within these core structures. Walmart Labs' e-commerce focus might lean more towards problems involving data processing, system design principles for scalability, and efficient data retrieval.

Here is a classic "Two Sum" problem, fundamental to both companies, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the significant overlap in core topics, the most efficient strategy is to **prepare for Walmart Labs first**. Here’s why:

1.  **Foundation First:** The Walmart Labs profile, with its stronger emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems across the core topics, provides the perfect training ground. Mastering these will build the essential muscle memory and problem-solving patterns you need for any interview.
2.  **Efficient Ramp-Up:** By solidifying your skills on the 152-question pool (focusing on Easy and Medium), you will have covered a large portion of the fundamental concepts needed for Uber. This creates a strong base.
3.  **Targeted Advanced Practice:** Once comfortable with the Walmart Labs-level problems, you can then layer on the additional preparation required for Uber. This involves deliberately seeking out more Hard problems, particularly in Dynamic Programming and graph-related scenarios that might use Arrays or Hash Tables as underlying structures.

In essence, use the Walmart Labs question set to build your algorithmic core strength. Then, use the larger and more challenging Uber question set for advanced conditioning and stamina building. This sequential approach ensures you are well-prepared for both, maximizing the return on your study time.
