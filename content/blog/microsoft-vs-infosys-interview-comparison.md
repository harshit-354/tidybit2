When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Microsoft and Infosys are major employers with distinct hiring processes, reflected in their publicly curated question lists. A direct comparison of these lists reveals key differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis, which should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of preparation material. Microsoft's list, with **1352 questions**, dwarfs Infosys's **158 questions**. This volume suggests a broader and deeper expected knowledge base for Microsoft candidates, aligning with its product-based, research-driven engineering culture.

The difficulty breakdown further highlights their different screening intensities:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211)**: The distribution is balanced, with a significant majority (~56%) of questions categorized as **Medium**. The high number of Hard questions (211) indicates that roles, especially senior ones, will test advanced problem-solving and optimization.
- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34)**: The distribution proportionally mirrors Microsoft's (~52% Medium, ~22% Hard), but the absolute numbers are far lower. This suggests Infosys interviews may focus on core competency and foundational logic, with less emphasis on solving numerous highly complex algorithmic puzzles.

```python
# Example of a foundational "Medium" array problem common to both:
def maxSubArray(nums):
    max_current = max_global = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        max_current = max(nums[i], max_current + nums[i])
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
    return max_global
```

```javascript
function maxSubArray(nums) {
  let maxCurrent = nums[0];
  let maxGlobal = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
    if (maxCurrent > maxGlobal) maxGlobal = maxCurrent;
  }
  return maxGlobal;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int maxCurrent = nums[0];
    int maxGlobal = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
        maxGlobal = Math.max(maxGlobal, maxCurrent);
    }
    return maxGlobal;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize **Array**, **String**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, confirming these as universal pillars of coding interviews. Mastering these is non-negotiable for either company.

The key difference lies in the fourth-ranked topic:

- **Microsoft** emphasizes **Hash Table**, critical for optimizing lookups and solving problems involving frequency counting, duplicates, or mappings (e.g., two-sum, substring problems).
- **Infosys** includes **Math**, indicating a stronger focus on numerical problems, puzzles, and basic algorithmic logic that may not require complex data structures.

This suggests Microsoft's interviews lean more towards assessing the ability to select and combine appropriate data structures for efficiency, while Infosys may include more logical and mathematical reasoning.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Hash Table focus (Microsoft): Two Sum
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Math focus (Infosys): Reverse Integer
def reverse(x):
    INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1
    rev = 0
    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
    x = abs(x)
    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10
        x //= 10
        if rev > (INT_MAX - pop) // 10:
            return 0
        rev = rev * 10 + pop
    return rev * sign
```

```javascript
// Hash Table focus (Microsoft): Two Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Math focus (Infosys): Reverse Integer
function reverse(x) {
  const INT_MAX = 2 ** 31 - 1,
    INT_MIN = -(2 ** 31);
  let rev = 0;
  while (x !== 0) {
    const pop = x % 10;
    x = Math.trunc(x / 10);
    if (rev > Math.trunc(INT_MAX / 10) || (rev === Math.trunc(INT_MAX / 10) && pop > 7)) return 0;
    if (rev < Math.trunc(INT_MIN / 10) || (rev === Math.trunc(INT_MIN / 10) && pop < -8)) return 0;
    rev = rev * 10 + pop;
  }
  return rev;
}
```

```java
// Hash Table focus (Microsoft): Two Sum
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Math focus (Infosys): Reverse Integer
public int reverse(int x) {
    int rev = 0;
    while (x != 0) {
        int pop = x % 10;
        x /= 10;
        if (rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
        if (rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
        rev = rev * 10 + pop;
    }
    return rev;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Infosys first**. Its smaller, foundational question set covering core topics (Array, String, DP, Math) establishes the essential problem-solving muscle memory. Success here builds confidence and a solid base. Once this core is strong, scaling up to **Microsoft's** list is a matter of volume, depth, and increased emphasis on advanced data structures like Hash Tables and tackling more Hard problems. This progression ensures you build from a stable foundation outward, rather than being overwhelmed by breadth and complexity from the start.
