When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your efficiency. Meta and Microsoft are two giants with distinct engineering cultures, yet their interview question banks reveal surprising similarities and subtle, critical differences. A direct comparison of their tagged questions on coding platforms shows nearly identical total volumes and difficulty distributions, but the emphasis on core topics diverges in one key area, making strategic preparation essential.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The overall question counts for Meta and Microsoft are remarkably similar, suggesting a comparable breadth of material you might encounter.

- **Meta** has **1387** tagged questions, distributed as **414 Easy**, **762 Medium**, and **211 Hard**.
- **Microsoft** has **1352** tagged questions, distributed as **379 Easy**, **762 Medium**, and **211 Hard**.

The near-identical numbers of Medium and Hard questions (762 and 211, respectively) are the most telling. This indicates that the _perceived challenge_ of interviews at both companies is similar, with a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. You should build a solid foundation by mastering Medium-level questions on core data structures and algorithms. The slight variance in Easy questions is negligible for interview prep, as those are typically used for warming up or screening.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the absolute core for both Meta and Microsoft interviews. You cannot afford to be weak in these areas.

The primary divergence lies in the fourth most frequent topic.

- **Meta** lists **Math** as a top category. This often encompasses number theory, probability, and combinatorics problems, which can appear in interviews for various roles.
- **Microsoft** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top category. This signals a stronger, more consistent emphasis on optimization problems involving overlapping subproblems, which is a classic and challenging area.

This difference shapes the problem-solving skills you need to highlight:

- For **Meta**, be prepared for clever, sometimes "mathy" insights to optimize solutions.
- For **Microsoft**, expect to decompose complex problems into states and demonstrate mastery of both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up tabulation approaches.

```python
# Example of a Math-oriented problem (e.g., check if a number is a power of two)
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Example of a classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example of a Math-oriented problem
function isPowerOfTwo(n) {
  return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
}

// Example of a classic DP problem
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example of a Math-oriented problem
public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}

// Example of a classic DP problem
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. The overlap in question volume, difficulty, and three core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) means that preparing for one company inherently prepares you for a large portion of the other.

1.  **Master the Common Core:** Grind Medium-difficulty problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. This is the highest-return investment for both companies.
2.  **Then, Branch for Your Target:** Once the core is solid, tailor your final preparation phase.
    - If **Meta** is your priority, dedicate time to math-based puzzles, bit manipulation, and probability problems.
    - If **Microsoft** is your priority, dive deep into Dynamic Programming patterns (0/1 knapsack, LCS, LIS, etc.) and system design fundamentals, which are also highly valued.

Given the nearly identical structure, if you are interviewing at both, you can prepare in parallel very effectively. Focus on the common Medium problems first, then layer on the specific topic emphasis (Math for Meta, DP for Microsoft) in your study plan.
