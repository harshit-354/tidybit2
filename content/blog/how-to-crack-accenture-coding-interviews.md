Accenture is a global professional services and technology company that hires tens of thousands of engineers annually across consulting, technology, and operations roles. Their interview process is designed for volume — efficient, standardized, and focused on core competencies. This is good news for candidates: the coding component of Accenture interviews is the most approachable among major tech employers. If your fundamentals are solid, you can pass. The challenge is not exotic difficulty but consistent execution and speed.

The Accenture hiring process for technology roles typically includes a cognitive and technical assessment, a coding round (usually online), a technical interview, and an HR round. For fresher hiring, the initial assessment is a significant filter, and the coding problems are straightforward but timed. Experienced hires face a more conversational technical interview that may include live coding.

## By the Numbers

Accenture has **144 questions** in the TidyBit database with the most beginner-friendly difficulty distribution among all companies tracked:

- **Easy: 65 questions (45%)** — Nearly half. Accenture interviews lean heavily on fundamental problem-solving.
- **Medium: 68 questions (47%)** — Almost exactly the other half. Together, Easy and Medium account for 92% of all questions.
- **Hard: 11 questions (8%)** — A tiny fraction. Hard problems are exceptionally rare in Accenture interviews.

The 45/47/8 split is the most accessible you will find at any major tech employer. If you have solid command of Easy and Medium problems, you are prepared for the vast majority of what Accenture will throw at you.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Array** — The most frequently tested topic. Accenture array problems are practical and direct: find the maximum, compute a running sum, rotate an array, identify duplicates. These are the building blocks, and they need to be solved quickly and without errors.

**String** — Basic string manipulation dominates: reversal, palindrome checks, character frequency, and simple parsing. Accenture's string problems rarely involve complex algorithms — they test whether you can handle standard string operations cleanly.

**Hash Table** — Used for counting, lookups, and duplicate detection. Hash map problems at Accenture tend to be at the Easy-to-Medium boundary. If you can use a hash map to solve two-sum and find duplicates, you have this category covered.

**Math** — Accenture tests basic mathematical programming more than most companies. Expect problems on factorial computation, Fibonacci sequences, prime numbers, Armstrong numbers, and digit manipulation. These are predictable and worth memorizing the patterns for.

**Dynamic Programming** — DP barely appears at the Hard level (which is only 8% of questions), but basic DP concepts like fibonacci-style recurrences and simple optimization problems may show up in Medium questions. A surface-level understanding is sufficient for most Accenture roles.

### Deep Dive: Array Problems

Array problems form the bedrock of Accenture's coding assessments. You must be proficient in iterating, accessing, and modifying arrays. Common patterns include:

- **Traversal:** Looping through all elements to find a sum, maximum, or minimum.
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** Used for problems like finding pairs with a given sum or removing duplicates from a sorted array.
- **Sliding Window:** Useful for finding subarrays that meet certain criteria (e.g., maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`).
- **In-place Operations:** Modifying the array without using extra space, such as rotating an array or moving zeros to the end.

Let's look at a classic example: rotating an array to the right by `k` steps. The brute-force method involves rotating by one step `k` times, but a more efficient method reverses parts of the array.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def rotate_array(nums, k):
    """
    Rotate the array to the right by k steps.
    Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 -> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
    """
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n  # Handle cases where k > n

    # Helper function to reverse a portion of the array
    def reverse(start, end):
        while start < end:
            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    # Reverse the entire array
    reverse(0, n - 1)
    # Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(0, k - 1)
    # Reverse the remaining n-k elements
    reverse(k, n - 1)

    return nums

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    print("Original:", arr)
    print("Rotated by 3:", rotate_array(arr, 3))
```

```javascript
function rotateArray(nums, k) {
  /**
   * Rotate the array to the right by k steps.
   * Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 -> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
   */
  const n = nums.length;
  k = k % n; // Handle cases where k > n

  // Helper function to reverse a portion of the array
  const reverse = (start, end) => {
    while (start < end) {
      [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
      start++;
      end--;
    }
  };

  // Reverse the entire array
  reverse(0, n - 1);
  // Reverse the first k elements
  reverse(0, k - 1);
  // Reverse the remaining n-k elements
  reverse(k, n - 1);

  return nums;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
console.log("Original:", arr);
console.log("Rotated by 3:", rotateArray([...arr], 3));
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayRotation {
    /**
     * Rotate the array to the right by k steps.
     * Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 -> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
     */
    public static void rotateArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n; // Handle cases where k > n

        // Reverse the entire array
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        // Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        // Reverse the remaining n-k elements
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1);
    }

    // Helper function to reverse a portion of the array
    private static void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
        System.out.println("Original: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
        rotateArray(arr, 3);
        System.out.println("Rotated by 3: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}
```

### Deep Dive: String Problems

String manipulation tests your ability to handle sequences of characters. Key operations include concatenation, slicing, searching, and comparison. Common Accenture problems involve checking properties (palindrome, anagram) or transforming the string (reversal, case conversion). Remember that strings are immutable in many languages, so operations often require creating new strings or using character arrays.

A quintessential problem is checking if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Check if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.
    Example: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" -> True
    """
    # Clean the string: keep only alphanumeric and convert to lowercase
    cleaned = ''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())

    # Two-pointer approach
    left, right = 0, len(cleaned) - 1
    while left < right:
        if cleaned[left] != cleaned[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

# Example usage
test_string = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
print(f"'{test_string}' is palindrome? {is_palindrome(test_string)}")
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  /**
   * Check if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.
   * Example: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" -> True
   */
  // Clean the string: keep only alphanumeric and convert to lowercase
  const cleaned = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "");

  // Two-pointer approach
  let left = 0;
  let right = cleaned.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (cleaned[left] !== cleaned[right]) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example usage
const testString = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";
console.log(`'${testString}' is palindrome? ${isPalindrome(testString)}`);
```

```java
public class PalindromeCheck {
    /**
     * Check if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.
     * Example: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" -> True
     */
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        // Clean the string: keep only alphanumeric and convert to lowercase
        StringBuilder cleaned = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(ch)) {
                cleaned.append(Character.toLowerCase(ch));
            }
        }
        String cleanedStr = cleaned.toString();

        // Two-pointer approach
        int left = 0;
        int right = cleanedStr.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (cleanedStr.charAt(left) != cleanedStr.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String testString = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";
        System.out.println("'" + testString + "' is palindrome? " + isPalindrome(testString));
    }
}
```

</div>

### Deep Dive: Hash Table Problems

Hash tables (or hash maps) provide average O(1) time complexity for insertions and lookups, making them ideal for problems involving frequency counting, duplicate detection, and pair finding. The classic "Two Sum" problem is a must-know. Understanding how to use a hash map to store complements can turn an O(n²) brute-force solution into an O(n) one.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
    Return their indices.
    Assume exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
    Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 -> [0, 1]
    """
    num_map = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found (though problem guarantees one)

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(f"Indices for two sum in {nums} with target {target}: {two_sum(nums, target)}")
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  /**
   * Find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
   * Return their indices.
   * Assume exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
   * Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 -> [0, 1]
   */
  const numMap = new Map(); // value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found (though problem guarantees one)
}

// Example usage
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(`Indices for two sum in [${nums}] with target ${target}:`, twoSum(nums, target));
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TwoSum {
    /**
     * Find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
     * Return their indices.
     * Assume exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
     * Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 -> [0, 1]
     */
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>(); // value -> index
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{numMap.get(complement), i};
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{}; // No solution found (though problem guarantees one)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
        int target = 9;
        int[] result = twoSum(nums, target);
        System.out.print("Indices for two sum in [2, 7, 11, 15] with target 9: ");
        System.out.println("[" + result[0] + ", " + result[1] + "]");
    }
}
```

### Deep Dive: Math Problems

Math problems test your ability to translate mathematical concepts into code. Common themes include number theory (prime, perfect, Armstrong numbers), sequences (Fibonacci, factorial), and digit manipulation. These problems often have simple iterative or recursive solutions. For efficiency, know when to use memoization or closed-form formulas.

Let's examine a common problem: checking if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_armstrong_number(num):
    """
    Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
    Example: 153 -> 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 -> True
    """
    # Convert number to string to easily get digits and number of digits
    str_num = str(num)
    n = len(str_num)

    # Calculate sum of digits raised to the power n
    total = sum(int(digit) ** n for digit in str_num)

    return total == num

# Example usage
test_num = 153
print(f"Is {test_num} an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong_number(test_num)}")
```

```javascript
function isArmstrongNumber(num) {
  /**
   * Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
   * Example: 153 -> 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 -> True
   */
  // Convert number to string to easily get digits and number of digits
  const strNum = num.toString();
  const n = strNum.length;

  // Calculate sum of digits raised to the power n
  let total = 0;
  for (let digit of strNum) {
    total += Math.pow(parseInt(digit), n);
  }

  return total === num;
}

// Example usage
const testNum = 153;
console.log(`Is ${testNum} an Armstrong number? ${isArmstrongNumber(testNum)}`);
```

```java
public class ArmstrongNumber {
    /**
     * Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
     * Example: 153 -> 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 -> True
     */
    public static boolean isArmstrongNumber(int num) {
        // Convert number to string to easily get digits and number of digits
        String strNum = Integer.toString(num);
        int n = strNum.length();

        // Calculate sum of digits raised to the power n
        int total = 0;
        for (char ch : strNum.toCharArray()) {
            int digit = Character.getNumericValue(ch);
            total += Math.pow(digit, n);
        }

        return total == num;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int testNum = 153;
        System.out.println("Is " + testNum + " an Armstrong number? " + isArmstrongNumber(testNum));
    }
}
```

</div>

### Deep Dive: Dynamic Programming Problems

While less frequent, basic Dynamic Programming (DP) problems test your ability to break down a problem into overlapping subproblems and avoid redundant computation. The key is to identify the recurrence relation. For Accenture, focus on foundational problems like Fibonacci, climbing stairs, or the 0/1 knapsack problem. Start with a recursive solution, add memoization (top-down), and then convert to an iterative (bottom-up) approach for efficiency.

Let's solve the classic "Climbing Stairs" problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    """
    Count distinct ways to climb to the top, taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Uses bottom-up dynamic programming.
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n

    # dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1  # 1 way to reach step 1: (1)
    dp[2] = 2  # 2 ways to reach step 2: (1,1) or (2)

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # To reach step i, you could come from step i-1 or step i-2
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]

# Example usage
steps = 5
print(f"Number of ways to climb {steps} stairs: {climb_stairs(steps)}")
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  /**
   * Count distinct ways to climb to the top, taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.
   * Uses bottom-up dynamic programming.
   */
  if (n <= 2) {
    return n;
  }

  // dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1; // 1 way to reach step 1: (1)
  dp[2] = 2; // 2 ways to reach step 2: (1,1) or (2)

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    // To reach step i, you could come from step i-1 or step i-2
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }

  return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
const steps = 5;
console.log(`Number of ways to climb ${steps} stairs: ${climbStairs(steps)}`);
```

```java
public class ClimbingStairs {
    /**
     * Count distinct ways to climb to the top, taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.
     * Uses bottom-up dynamic programming.
     */
    public static int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }

        // dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1; // 1 way to reach step 1: (1)
        dp[2] = 2; // 2 ways to reach step 2: (1,1) or (2)

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            // To reach step i, you could come from step i-1 or step i-2
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int steps = 5;
        System.out.println("Number of ways to climb " + steps + " stairs: " + climbStairs(steps));
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy

**Weeks 1-2: Crush the Fundamentals**

This is the most important phase for Accenture preparation. Solve 5 to 6 Easy problems per day across arrays, strings, math, and hash tables. Focus on speed and correctness — you should be able to solve any Easy problem in under 10 minutes. Practice math problems especially: prime checking, digit sums, and number pattern problems are Accenture staples.

**Week 3: Easy-to-Medium Transition**

Start solving low-Medium problems. Continue solving 3 to 4 problems per day, mixing Easy and Medium. Introduce two-pointer and basic hash map patterns. Practice writing complete solutions including input handling, as Accenture's online assessments often require full program submissions rather than function-only solutions.

**Week 4: Medium Problem Confidence**

Spend a full week on Medium problems across all five top topics. Aim for 2 to 3 per day. Do not worry about Hard problems — your time is better spent ensuring you can solve every Medium problem you encounter. Practice basic DP only if you have time: climbing stairs, minimum cost path, and coin change are sufficient.

**Week 5: Timed Simulations**

Simulate Accenture's online assessment format. Set a timer for 60 minutes and solve 3 to 4 problems of mixed Easy and Medium difficulty. Run three to four such simulations throughout the week. Time management is critical in Accenture's actual assessment, where rushing leads to careless errors.

**Week 6: Technical Interview Prep**

Accenture's technical interview goes beyond coding. Review fundamental CS concepts: OOPS principles, database basics (SQL queries, normalization), networking essentials (HTTP, TCP/IP), and operating system concepts (processes vs. threads, memory management). Prepare to explain your projects and technical experience clearly.

## Key Tips

1. **Speed and accuracy matter more than optimization.** Accenture's coding rounds are timed and straightforward. A correct brute-force solution submitted quickly beats an optimal solution submitted after the deadline. Focus on getting working code fast.

2. **Do not over-prepare.** Spending months grinding Hard LeetCode problems is overkill for Accenture. If you can reliably solve Easy problems in 10 minutes and Medium problems in 25 minutes, you are ready. Use your remaining preparation time for the aptitude and technical interview components.

3. **Practice the cognitive assessment.** Accenture's initial screening includes cognitive and logical reasoning components. Many candidates underestimate this and fail before reaching the coding round. Practice quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, and English comprehension.

4. **Know your fundamentals cold.** Accenture's technical interview often asks you to explain concepts rather than just code them. Be ready to explain how a hash map works, what the time complexity of sorting algorithms is, and what OOP inheritance means — in plain language.

5. **Prepare domain knowledge for experienced roles.** If you are a lateral hire, expect questions specific to your domain: cloud services, data engineering, full-stack development, or whatever role you are applying for. Accenture values practical experience and domain expertise alongside coding ability.
