When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Microsoft and Roblox, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty, and focus. Microsoft's process is a long-established benchmark for software engineering roles, whereas Roblox's reflects its niche in gaming and real-time simulation. A strategic candidate analyzes these differences to allocate preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of known questions is the most striking difference. Microsoft's list of approximately 1,352 questions is vast, built up over decades of interviewing for a huge range of product teams and roles globally. The difficulty distribution (379 Easy, 762 Medium, 211 Hard) shows a strong emphasis on Medium-level problems, which are typical for assessing core problem-solving and implementation skills. You cannot feasibly memorize this list; success requires mastering underlying patterns.

In contrast, Roblox's known list is much smaller, around 56 questions. The distribution (8 Easy, 36 Medium, 12 Hard) indicates an even heavier skew toward Medium-difficulty problems. The smaller volume suggests a more curated or newer question bank, but it does not mean the interview is easier. With fewer questions, each one may carry more weight, and interviewers might probe deeper into your solution's optimization and your thought process.

**Example: A classic "Two Sum" problem could appear at both.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Topic Overlap

There is significant overlap in the top four topics for both companies: **Array, String, Hash Table**, and then either **Dynamic Programming** (Microsoft) or **Math** (Roblox). This core set forms the foundation of most coding interviews.

- **Array, String, Hash Table:** These are universal. Expect questions on string manipulation, array traversal, and using hash maps for efficient lookups.
- **Dynamic Programming (Microsoft):** Its prominence for Microsoft signals you must prepare for complex optimization problems, often involving recursion with memoization or bottom-up tabulation. This is a key differentiator.
- **Math (Roblox):** Roblox's inclusion of Math in its top four may relate to game development fundamentals (vectors, geometry, probability) or algorithmic puzzles. While math appears at Microsoft too, its placement in Roblox's shortlist suggests more focused attention.

**Example: A problem combining arrays and math (common for Roblox) vs. a DP problem (common for Microsoft).**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python - Roblox-style (Math/Array)
# Count pairs with a given sum.
def countPairs(arr, target):
    count = 0
    seen = {}
    for num in arr:
        complement = target - num
        count += seen.get(complement, 0)
        seen[num] = seen.get(num, 0) + 1
    return count

# Python - Microsoft-style (Dynamic Programming)
# Climbing Stairs.
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - Roblox-style
function countPairs(arr, target) {
  let count = 0;
  const map = new Map();
  for (const num of arr) {
    const complement = target - num;
    count += map.get(complement) || 0;
    map.set(num, (map.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}

// JavaScript - Microsoft-style
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Java - Roblox-style
public int countPairs(int[] arr, int target) {
    int count = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : arr) {
        int complement = target - num;
        count += map.getOrDefault(complement, 0);
        map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}

// Java - Microsoft-style
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Microsoft first**. Its broader and deeper question pool covers a wider range of algorithms and data structures, including the challenging Dynamic Programming category. Mastering the patterns needed for Microsoft (especially Medium-level problems on arrays, strings, hash tables, and DP) will inherently cover the core technical fundamentals tested at Roblox. This approach builds the strongest general interview skills.

Once comfortable with these fundamentals, pivot to Roblox-specific preparation. Use the smaller question list for targeted practice, and emphasize the **Math** topic—review number theory, basic combinatorics, and geometric principles. Also, consider delving into topics relevant to real-time systems or game-adjacent logic, which may not be fully captured in the listed tags.

In short, Microsoft preparation is a comprehensive foundation. Roblox preparation is a strategic specialization on top of that foundation.
