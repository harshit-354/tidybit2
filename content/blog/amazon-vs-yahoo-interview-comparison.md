When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Amazon and Yahoo, while both tech giants, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty, and focus. Amazon's process is famously rigorous and data-driven, with a vast, well-documented question pool. Yahoo's process, reflecting its current scale and product focus, involves a significantly smaller and generally less difficult set of problems. A strategic candidate will prioritize Amazon due to its breadth, but understanding Yahoo's leaner profile is valuable for targeted preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of reported questions sets these companies apart. Amazon's list of **1,938 questions** dwarfs Yahoo's **64**. This disparity reflects Amazon's immense hiring scale, standardized looping process, and the extensive candidate feedback available on platforms like TidyBit.

The difficulty distribution further highlights the difference:

- **Amazon (E530/M1057/H351):** Medium difficulty questions dominate (≈55%), but there is a substantial pool of Hard questions (≈18%). This demands preparation for complex optimization problems.
- **Yahoo (E26/M32/H6):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Easy and Medium questions (≈91% combined), with very few Hard problems. The interview is more likely to test solid fundamentals and clean code over highly advanced algorithms.

This means preparing for Amazon inherently covers the difficulty range needed for Yahoo, but not vice-versa.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Amazon:** Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
- **Yahoo:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

**Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the essential backbone for both. You must be proficient in two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and frequency counting.

**The key differentiator is Dynamic Programming (DP).** DP is a major focus for Amazon (its 4th most frequent topic) but is scarcely represented in Yahoo's current list. Mastering DP is non-negotiable for Amazon. For Yahoo, **Sorting** and its applications (e.g., Merge Intervals, Kth Largest Element) take precedence as a primary topic.

A common question like "Two Sum" exemplifies the shared foundation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

You should **prepare for Amazon first**. Its question bank is vast and covers a wider spectrum of difficulty, especially in Dynamic Programming. Successfully tackling Amazon-style Medium and Hard questions will make Yahoo's question set feel like a focused subset. Your study plan should be: 1) Master core data structures (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables), 2) Drill into Amazon's frequent patterns like DP and Trees/Graphs, and 3) Review Sorting algorithms and related problems to solidify the base needed for Yahoo.

If you are interviewing with both, use Amazon preparation as your comprehensive baseline. In the final days before a Yahoo interview, shift to reviewing their specific, smaller question list to familiarize yourself with their exact problem style, which tends to be more straightforward.
