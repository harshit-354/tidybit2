Dynamic Programming (DP) is a core algorithmic technique for optimizing solutions to complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. At Huawei, where engineers design efficient telecommunications systems, network algorithms, and resource-constrained software, the ability to model and solve optimization problems is critical. Of the approximately 20 coding questions in their technical interviews, around 6 are dedicated to Dynamic Programming. This high concentration signals that Huawei doesn't just test for basic coding ability; it assesses a candidate's skill in designing optimal, scalable solutions—a direct requirement for handling large-scale distributed systems and real-time data processing.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Huawei's DP questions often focus on practical optimization scenarios rather than purely academic puzzles. You can expect problems in these key categories:

1.  **Knapsack & Resource Allocation:** Problems involving maximizing value or minimizing cost given limited resources (e.g., bandwidth, memory, budget). This directly mirrors allocating network resources or hardware constraints.
2.  **String & Sequence Analysis:** Common problems include Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Edit Distance, which are foundational for data comparison, version control, and bioinformatics—all relevant to Huawei's work in software and data.
3.  **Pathfinding & Grid Problems:** Finding minimum/maximum cost paths or unique paths in a grid. This models network routing, robot navigation, and optimization of signal paths.
4.  **Interval & Scheduling Problems:** Determining optimal schedules or partitions, which relates to job scheduling on servers or efficient task processing.

The problems will often be framed within a business or systems context, but their core will be a classic DP pattern.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Success in DP interviews requires recognizing patterns and implementing efficient solutions. Follow this approach:

1.  **Master the Fundamentals:** Understand the core principles—optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Know the difference between top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Don't memorize problems. Learn to identify patterns like "0/1 Knapsack," "Longest Increasing Subsequence," or "Fibonacci-style" state transitions.
3.  **Practice State Definition:** The hardest part is often defining `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]`. Clearly articulate what your state represents before writing code.
4.  **Start with Brute Force:** Before optimizing, reason through a recursive brute-force solution. This clarifies the subproblems and makes the transition to DP logical.

**Code Example: The 0/1 Knapsack Pattern**
This is a fundamental pattern for resource allocation problems. Given items with weights and values, and a capacity limit, maximize the total value.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    n = len(values)
    # dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take the item
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip the item
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                # Cannot take the item
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(values, weights, capacity) {
  const n = values.length;
  // dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        // Option 1: Take the item
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        // Option 2: Skip the item
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        // Cannot take the item
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] values, int[] weights, int capacity) {
        int n = values.length;
        // dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    // Option 1: Take the item
                    int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                    // Option 2: Skip the item
                    int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
                } else {
                    // Cannot take the item
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }
}
```

1.  **Foundation:** Climbing Stairs, Fibonacci Number (understand state transition).
2.  **1D DP:** House Robber, Coin Change (master single-array state).
3.  **Classic 2D DP:** 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (learn tabulation on grids).
4.  **String DP:** Edit Distance, Longest Palindromic Subsequence.
5.  **Interval & Advanced:** Matrix Chain Multiplication, Partition Equal Subset Sum.
6.  **Huawei-Specific Practice:** Finally, solve problems tagged for Huawei on platforms like TidyBit, focusing on the problem types outlined above.
