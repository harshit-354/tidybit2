When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Adobe and Accenture, while both major tech employers, have distinct interview processes reflecting their different business models: Adobe as a product-focused software company and Accenture as a global IT services and consulting firm. This comparison analyzes their technical interview question profiles to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in both the volume and the difficulty distribution of questions.

**Adobe** has a larger overall question bank (227 questions) with a significant emphasis on medium difficulty. The breakdown is approximately 30% Easy (68 questions), 57% Medium (129 questions), and 13% Hard (30 questions). This profile is typical for a core software engineering role at a product company, where the interview is designed to deeply assess problem-solving and algorithmic proficiency. The substantial number of Medium and Hard questions indicates you must be comfortable with complex problem variations and optimization.

**Accenture** has a smaller catalog (144 questions) with a much heavier skew toward foundational problems. The breakdown is roughly 45% Easy (65 questions), 47% Medium (68 questions), and only 8% Hard (11 questions). This distribution aligns with Accenture's broader hiring for consulting, analytics, and application development roles, where the technical screen often focuses on core competency, clarity of thought, and practical coding ability rather than highly specialized algorithmic optimization.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with a subtle difference in emphasis.

The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. These are essential for any technical interview. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures, performing searches, and implementing efficient solutions using hash maps for lookups.

**Adobe's** listed topics include **Two Pointers**. This is a critical pattern for solving problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or sliding windows, often used in more complex Medium and Hard questions. Its presence underscores Adobe's focus on algorithmic patterns.

**Accenture's** unique listed topic is **Math**. This includes number theory, basic arithmetic operations, and mathematical logic problems. This reflects the practical problem-solving often required in business application development and data analysis contexts common at a consulting firm.

Here is a typical problem that might appear at both, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target role and the timing of your interviews.

If your goal is a **software development engineer (SDE) role at a product company**, prioritize **Adobe**. Mastering its question profile—especially the high volume of Medium problems and patterns like Two Pointers—will build a strong algorithmic foundation that is transferable to most tech companies, including Accenture. The Hard problems will prepare you for the toughest rounds.

If you are aiming for a **technology analyst, consulting, or application development role**, or if you are earlier in your coding interview journey, start with **Accenture**. Its focus on Easy and Medium problems on core topics allows you to solidify fundamentals without being overwhelmed. Success here builds confidence. You can then layer on more complex patterns (like Two Pointers) to expand your scope to companies like Adobe.

In practice, a robust preparation strategy covers the union of both sets: achieve fluency in Array, String, Hash Table, and Math problems first (Accenture's core), then diligently practice Two Pointer patterns and tackle more challenging problem variations (Adobe's emphasis).
