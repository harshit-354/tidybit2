When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. DoorDash and Epam Systems present distinct interview landscapes, shaped by their core business models. DoorDash, a hyper-growth logistics and delivery platform, emphasizes complex, scalable system design and algorithmic problem-solving for real-time operations. Epam Systems, a global provider of digital platform engineering and software development services, focuses on strong foundational coding skills, clean implementation, and adaptability across client projects. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty, and topic distribution to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a significant disparity in both the number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

**DoorDash** has a larger, more challenging question pool with **87 questions**, categorized as 51 Easy, 30 Medium, and 6 Hard. The presence of Hard questions, though fewer, indicates that senior-level interviews (e.g., for senior software engineer or above) will likely involve at least one complex problem requiring optimized solutions, often involving graphs, dynamic programming, or advanced data structure manipulation. The high volume suggests a broad set of patterns to master.

**Epam Systems** has a smaller pool of **51 questions**, with a heavy skew toward easier problems: 19 Easy, 30 Medium, and only 2 Hard. This distribution suggests their interviews strongly emphasize correctness, clarity, and the ability to handle medium-difficulty algorithmic challenges efficiently. The virtual absence of Hard questions implies that the technical screen and onsite rounds are less likely to include highly esoteric or extreme optimization problems, focusing instead on robust implementation of common patterns.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures, but with different secondary emphases.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are fundamental for both. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures.

**DoorDash's Distinct Focus:** Depth-First Search (DFS) is a prominent topic. This aligns with problems involving hierarchies, paths, or state exploration—common in mapping, menu systems, or order state machines. Expect tree and graph traversal problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DFS pattern (Tree)
def dfs(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    return dfs(node.left, target) or dfs(node.right, target)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS pattern (Tree)
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS pattern (Tree)
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

</div>

**Epam Systems' Distinct Focus:** Two Pointers is a highlighted topic. This points to an emphasis on efficient in-place array/string manipulation, sorting-related problems, and sliding window techniques—common in general software development tasks.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Two Pointers pattern
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return s
```

```javascript
// Example Two Pointers pattern
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    [s[left], s[right]] = [s[right], s[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return s;
}
```

```java
// Example Two Pointers pattern
public char[] reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return s;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and career focus.

**Prepare for DoorDash first if:** You are aiming for senior roles, have more time to prepare, or want to tackle a broader range of difficult problems. Mastering the DoorDash list will inherently cover most of Epam's core topics (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables) while also forcing you to learn advanced patterns like DFS. This is the more comprehensive and challenging path.

**Prepare for Epam Systems first if:** Your interviews are imminent, you are early in your coding interview practice, or you are applying for mid-level or general software engineering positions. The focus on Easy and Medium problems on core topics allows you to build confidence and fluency quickly. You can solidify fundamentals like Two Pointers, which are also beneficial for any interview.

A strategic hybrid approach is to start with the shared core (Array, String, Hash Table) and Epam's Two Pointers focus to build a solid foundation. Then, layer in DoorDash's specific emphasis on Depth-First Search and tackle their Medium and Hard problems to elevate your problem-solving ability. This ensures you are well-prepared for both company's expectations.
