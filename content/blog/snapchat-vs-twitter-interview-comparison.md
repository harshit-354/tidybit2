When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and problem types they favor can significantly increase your chances of success. Snapchat and Twitter (now X) are two prominent social media platforms with distinct engineering challenges, which is reflected in their interview question profiles. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company. On TidyBit, Snapchat has a catalog of **99 questions**, while Twitter has **53**. This volume often correlates with how frequently a company's problems are reported by candidates and can indicate a broader or more established interview question bank.

The difficulty distribution is also telling:

- **Snapchat (99q):** Easy: 6, Medium: 62, Hard: 31.
- **Twitter (53q):** Easy: 8, Medium: 33, Hard: 12.

Snapchat's profile shows a heavier emphasis on **Medium and Hard problems**, with nearly one-third of its questions categorized as Hard. This suggests their interviews may have a higher bar for algorithmic complexity and optimization. Twitter's distribution is more balanced, leaning towards Medium-difficulty problems, which could indicate a focus on practical problem-solving over highly esoteric algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are top topics for both Snapchat and Twitter. This is standard for software engineering interviews, as these structures form the backbone of most applications.

The key differentiator lies in their secondary focuses:

- **Snapchat** lists **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** as a top topic. This aligns with features that involve graph-like networks (friends, stories, location) and level-order traversal problems. Expect questions about shortest paths, traversal in matrices, or social network degrees of separation.
- **Twitter** lists **Design** as a top topic. This reflects the platform's scale and complexity, requiring candidates to think about system architecture, data flow, and API design for features like timelines, tweet delivery, and trending topics.

This divergence is critical. Preparing for Snapchat means drilling into graph traversal and matrix problems. Preparing for Twitter requires balancing algorithmic practice with system design fundamentals.

Here is a typical BFS pattern, crucial for Snapchat:

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_matrix(grid, start):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        # Process cell (r, c)
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
```

```javascript
function bfsMatrix(grid, start) {
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  const dirs = [
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [0, -1],
    [-1, 0],
  ];
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set();
  visited.add(`${start[0]},${start[1]}`);

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [r, c] = queue.shift();
    // Process cell (r, c)
    for (const [dr, dc] of dirs) {
      const nr = r + dr,
        nc = c + dc;
      const key = `${nr},${nc}`;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.has(key)) {
        visited.add(key);
        queue.push([nr, nc]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public void bfsMatrix(int[][] grid, int[] start) {
    int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
    int[][] directions = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};
    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

    queue.offer(start);
    visited.add(start[0] + "," + start[1]);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int[] cell = queue.poll();
        int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];
        // Process cell (r, c)
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
            String key = nr + "," + nc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.contains(key)) {
                visited.add(key);
                queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and interview timeline.

If your goal is **Snapchat**, prioritize mastering **Medium to Hard problems** on core data structures (Array, String, Hash Table) and dedicate significant time to **graph algorithms, particularly BFS and DFS**. Practice matrix traversal, shortest path, and level-order problems extensively.

If your goal is **Twitter**, you should still be strong in core algorithms, but you **must integrate system design practice**. Their question distribution suggests you can expect a mix of manageable coding problems and in-depth design discussions. Ensure you can articulate scalable designs for common social media features.

For a generalist preparing for both, start with the **shared foundation**: solve a high volume of Array, String, and Hash Table problems to build fluency. Then, branch out: practice BFS/DFS problems for Snapchat's domain and study scalable system design principles for Twitter's. Given Snapchat's larger question bank and higher difficulty skew, allocating more time to its problem set may offer broader algorithmic coverage that will benefit you for Twitter's coding rounds as well.
