When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Amazon and JPMorgan Chase (JPMorgan) represent two distinct archetypes: a tech giant with a deeply engineering-driven culture and a global financial institution with a growing, but more selective, technical arm. Their approaches to technical assessments reflect this difference, impacting how you should prioritize and structure your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of reported questions is the most striking difference. Amazon's list of nearly 2,000 questions dwarfs JPMorgan's approximately 80. This doesn't mean Amazon has more unique questions, but it indicates a much larger and more active pool of candidates sharing their experiences, reflecting Amazon's massive scale of technical hiring for software development engineer (SDE) roles.

The difficulty distribution also reveals distinct profiles:

- **Amazon (E530/M1057/H351):** The difficulty spread is a classic bell curve centered on **Medium**. This is standard for top tech companies, where the majority of on-site interview rounds are designed to be solved by a well-prepared candidate within 30-45 minutes. The significant number of Hard questions often appears in later rounds (e.g., Bar Raiser) or for more senior positions.
- **JPMorgan (E25/M45/H8):** The distribution also leans towards Medium, but the total count is far lower. The relatively higher proportion of Easy questions suggests their technical screens might be more accessible initially, possibly focusing on core competency verification. The small number of Hard questions implies that deeply complex algorithmic problems are less of a staple than at Amazon.

```python
# Example of a common "Medium" difficulty problem: Two Sum.
# This tests hash table understanding and is prevalent at both.
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# The expectation at Amazon might involve more follow-up
# (e.g., handle sorted input, multiple pairs, etc.).
```

```javascript
// JavaScript implementation of Two Sum.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Java implementation of Two Sum.
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the core for each. This is excellent news for candidates, as mastery of these areas provides a strong foundation for both interview processes.

The key difference lies in the next layer of topics:

- **Amazon** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a major topic. DP problems are a hallmark of rigorous tech interviews and require dedicated, pattern-based practice.
- **JPMorgan** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic instead. While sorting is a concept often embedded in other solutions, its explicit mention suggests a possible focus on practical data manipulation and understanding of fundamental algorithms.

In practice, Amazon's question pool will demand a broader and deeper algorithmic knowledge, including trees, graphs, recursion, and system design for later rounds. JPMorgan's technical questions are more likely to remain within the realm of applied problem-solving using core data structures.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by the **scope of the interview**.

If your goal is to pass **JPMorgan's** technical interview, a focused approach is effective. Master the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) through a standard LeetCode study plan. Ensure you can cleanly implement and reason about fundamental algorithms. The limited question pool means practicing company-tagged questions can be highly efficient.

Preparing for **Amazon** first, however, creates a superset of readiness. The intense, wide-ranging practice required for Amazon—covering DP, graphs, trees, and behavioral questions using the Leadership Principles—will inherently cover nearly all the technical ground needed for JPMorgan. The reverse is not true. If you have interviews at both, starting with Amazon's preparation will build the depth and stamina that makes JPMorgan's technical assessment feel more manageable.

In summary, use JPMorgan's list for efficient, targeted practice. Use Amazon's list for comprehensive, foundational training that will serve you for any technical interview in the industry.
