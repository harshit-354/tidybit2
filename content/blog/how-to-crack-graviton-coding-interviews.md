Graviton’s technical interviews are known for a rigorous, systems-focused approach that blends algorithmic problem-solving with real-world engineering design. While the exact format can vary by team, the core of their process remains a series of coding interviews that test fundamental computer science knowledge applied at scale. Success requires more than just solving problems; it demands clean, efficient, and well-communicated code under pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Graviton coding questions reveals a clear pattern: they lean heavily into intermediate and advanced challenges. Out of a sample set, 71% (5 questions) were rated Medium, and 29% (2 questions) were Hard. Notably, there were zero Easy questions.

This distribution is telling. Graviton isn't screening for basic syntax recall; they are testing for mastery. The absence of Easy problems means your first interview question will likely require a multi-step solution involving a non-trivial data structure or algorithm. The high proportion of Medium problems forms the foundation—these are the questions you must solve flawlessly to advance. The Hard problems are the differentiator, often involving an optimization on a classic pattern or a complex graph traversal scenario. Your preparation must be geared toward this level of difficulty from the start.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these five areas, which dominate Graviton's question bank.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The cornerstone of graph and tree traversal. Understand recursive vs. iterative implementations, when to use each (DFS for paths, connectivity; BFS for shortest paths, level-order), and how to avoid cycles. For Graviton, expect applications in network analysis or hierarchical data processing.

**Graph Theory:** Goes beyond simple traversal. Be ready for problems involving topological sort (for dependency resolution), union-find (for dynamic connectivity), Dijkstra's algorithm (for weighted shortest paths), and cycle detection. Graviton's systems-oriented problems often model components as graph nodes.

**Dynamic Programming (DP):** Essential for optimization problems. You must be able to identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Focus on both 1D and 2D tabulation approaches, as well as memoization for top-down recursion. Common patterns include knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings or grids.

**Array:** Never underestimate array manipulation. Graviton's Medium problems often use arrays as the input for more complex algorithms (e.g., representing graph adjacency lists, DP tables, or traversal states). Master techniques like two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums.

**Binary Tree:** While not the top by count, tree problems frequently appear as a subset of DFS/BFS. Be proficient in inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals, as well as solving problems like finding the lowest common ancestor or validating tree properties.

### Code Example: Key BFS Pattern for Shortest Path

The following example demonstrates the classic BFS template for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, a pattern critical for many Graviton problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, target):
    if start == target:
        return 0

    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    distance = 0

    while queue:
        # Process all nodes at the current distance level
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            # Check if we've reached the target
            if node == target:
                return distance
            # Explore neighbors
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        # Move to the next level (increase distance)
        distance += 1
    return -1  # Target not reachable
```

```javascript
function shortestPathBFS(graph, start, target) {
  if (start === target) return 0;

  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set([start]);
  let distance = 0;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    // Process all nodes at the current distance level
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      if (node === target) return distance;

      // Explore neighbors
      for (const neighbor of graph[node] || []) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          visited.add(neighbor);
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
    distance++;
  }
  return -1; // Target not reachable
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BFSShortestPath {
    public int shortestPath(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start, int target) {
        if (start == target) return 0;

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        queue.offer(start);
        visited.add(start);
        int distance = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                int node = queue.poll();
                if (node == target) return distance;

                for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
                    if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                        visited.add(neighbor);
                        queue.offer(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
            distance++;
        }
        return -1; // Target not reachable
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Patterns.** Dedicate this phase to mastering the top five topics. Don't just read; implement. For each topic (DFS/BFS, Graph Theory, DP, Array), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on internalizing the standard templates, like the BFS pattern shown above.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Difficulty Ramp.** Start blending topics. Solve problems where you need to combine techniques, like using DFS for traversal within a DP solution or applying BFS on a 2D array (grid). Begin incorporating Hard problems—aim for 1-2 per day. Analyze why they are Hard: is it the time complexity constraint, the complex state management, or a non-obvious trick?

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Review.** Conduct mock interviews under timed conditions (45-60 minutes). Simulate the Graviton style: explain your thought process aloud, write production-quality code with error checks, and discuss optimization. In the final days, revisit all the problems you struggled with. Re-implement them without looking at the solution to cement the patterns.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Aloud.** Graviton evaluates how you think. Narrate your analysis of the problem, discuss brute-force approaches first, then explain your optimization rationale. Silence is a red flag.
2.  **Optimize From the Start.** Given the difficulty curve, a naive O(n²) solution for a Medium problem is often a dead end. Think about the optimal data structure (e.g., HashSet for O(1) lookups, Heap for priority) as you outline your first approach.
3.  **Write Robust Code Immediately.** Don't write a skeleton and fill it in later. Write clean, complete functions from the first line. Include base cases, handle null/empty inputs, and use descriptive variable names. This demonstrates professional coding habits.
4.  **Practice Graph Construction.** Many Graviton problems describe a scenario (e.g., "servers communicating over a network") that you must explicitly model as a graph (adjacency list or matrix). Practice this translation step until it's automatic.
5.  **Master One Language Deeply.** Use Python for speed, Java for type-explicit structure, or JavaScript if it's your domain. Graviton interviews require deep fluency, not syntax lookup. Know the standard library for collections, sorting, and utilities cold.

Consistent, focused practice on these core algorithms and patterns is the most reliable way to build the competence and confidence needed to succeed. Start with the fundamentals, pressure-test with hard problems, and simulate the real environment.
