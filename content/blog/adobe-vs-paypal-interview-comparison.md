When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your efficiency. Adobe and PayPal, while both prominent in the tech industry, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their coding interview question profiles to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company. Adobe's list, with **227 questions**, is more than double PayPal's **106 questions**. This suggests that Adobe's interview process has been documented more extensively by candidates over time, potentially indicating a wider variety of problems or a longer history of a standardized process.

Analyzing the difficulty distribution reveals further insights:

- **Adobe (E68/M129/H30):** The majority of questions are Medium (129), with a significant number of Easy (68) and a smaller set of Hard (30). This points to an interview that is fundamentally challenging but balanced, often using Medium problems as a core filter.
- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The distribution is skewed even more heavily toward Medium difficulty (69), with fewer Easy (18) and a comparable proportion of Hard (19) relative to its total. This indicates a slightly more concentrated focus on mid-range complexity problems.

In essence, both companies center their interviews on Medium-difficulty questions, but Adobe's larger pool includes more introductory Easy problems, possibly used in early screening rounds.

## Topic Overlap

The core technical focus for both companies is remarkably aligned, centering on fundamental data structures and algorithms.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems form the absolute foundation for both Adobe and PayPal interviews. Mastering these is non-negotiable. A question like "Two Sum" is a classic example that could appear at either company.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

</div>

**Key Differentiator:** The most notable difference in topic lists is **Two Pointers** for Adobe and **Sorting** for PayPal. This suggests a subtle shift in problem-solving patterns:

- **Adobe's** inclusion of Two Pointers hints at a preference for problems involving array or string manipulation where efficient traversal from both ends is key (e.g., palindrome checks, removing duplicates from a sorted array).
- **PayPal's** explicit mention of Sorting indicates that many of their array/string problems may require sorting as a crucial preprocessing step to enable other techniques like two pointers or greedy algorithms.

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the significant overlap, a unified preparation strategy for core topics is highly effective. **Start by mastering Array, String, and Hash Table problems.** Build strong competency with Medium-difficulty questions using these structures.

If you have interviews at both companies, **preparing for Adobe first is a strategic choice**. Adobe's larger and slightly broader question pool, which includes Two Pointers techniques, will inherently cover a wide swath of fundamentals. Successfully solving a diverse set of Adobe's Medium problems will build a robust foundation. You can then transition to PayPal-specific preparation by placing extra emphasis on **Sorting algorithms and their applications**. Practice problems where sorting is the key insight that unlocks an efficient solution.

Ultimately, depth in fundamentals matters more than company-specific lists. Use the topic distributions to identify weak spots in your knowledge, not to predict exact questions.
