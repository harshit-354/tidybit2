Chubb’s technical interview process for software engineering roles is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. Candidates can typically expect one or two rounds focused on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live coding environment. The questions are applied and lean toward real-world optimization scenarios rather than abstract computer science theory. Success hinges on recognizing core patterns and implementing clean, efficient solutions under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our analysis of recent Chubb coding questions reveals a clear profile: **4 questions total, with 0% Easy, 75% Medium, and 25% Hard**. This distribution is telling.

The complete absence of Easy questions means the interview starts at a significant level of complexity. You won't be warming up with simple string manipulation. The bulk (3 out of 4) are Medium-difficulty problems. These questions test your mastery of fundamental data structures and algorithms under moderate constraints. You’ll need to identify the correct approach, handle edge cases, and produce bug-free code efficiently.

The single Hard question (25% of the set) is the differentiator. It’s where Chubb separates competent candidates from exceptional ones. This question will likely involve combining multiple concepts or optimizing a solution that has a straightforward but inefficient answer. The key is not to panic; a structured approach and clear communication are often as valuable as a perfect solution under time pressure.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a strong emphasis on a few interconnected topics. Mastering these will cover the vast majority of problems you'll see.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Chubb's problems often use arrays as the input for more complex algorithms. You must be comfortable with traversal, in-place manipulation, and using arrays to implement other patterns.
- **Greedy:** A favorite for insurance and financial logic problems, which involve making a series of locally optimal choices to reach a global optimum. Questions often ask for a maximum count, minimum cost, or optimal scheduling.
- **Prefix Sum:** A critical optimization technique for problems involving the sum of subarrays. By pre-computing cumulative sums, you can answer range-sum queries in constant time, turning an O(n²) brute-force solution into O(n).
- **Queue:** Used in breadth-first search (BFS) and, more importantly for Chubb, in implementing the **Sliding Window** pattern. Understanding how to maintain a FIFO data structure is key.
- **Sliding Window:** **This is the single most important pattern for Chubb interviews.** It elegantly solves problems requiring analysis of contiguous subarrays or substrings with a fixed or dynamic window size, often achieving O(n) time complexity. It frequently combines with other concepts like hashing (for character counts) or a queue/deque (for maintaining window elements).

Given its importance, here is a template for the **Dynamic Sliding Window** pattern, used to find the minimum length subarray with a sum at least `target`.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def min_subarray_length(target, nums):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]  # Expand the window to the right

        # Shrink the window from the left while the condition is met
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1

    return 0 if min_length == float('inf') else min_length
```

```javascript
function minSubarrayLength(target, nums) {
  let left = 0;
  let currentSum = 0;
  let minLength = Infinity;

  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    currentSum += nums[right]; // Expand window

    // Shrink window from left while condition is satisfied
    while (currentSum >= target) {
      minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
      currentSum -= nums[left];
      left++;
    }
  }

  return minLength === Infinity ? 0 : minLength;
}
```

```java
public int minSubarrayLength(int target, int[] nums) {
    int left = 0;
    int currentSum = 0;
    int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        currentSum += nums[right]; // Expand window

        // Shrink window from left while condition is satisfied
        while (currentSum >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            currentSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Patterns.**
Focus intensely on the top five topics. Solve 2-3 problems daily, starting with fundamental patterns: Sliding Window (fixed and dynamic), Prefix Sum applications, and classic Greedy algorithms (e.g., activity selection, coin change variants). Use a platform that categorizes problems by pattern.

**Weeks 3-4: Medium-Intensity Integration.**
Shift to solving only Medium-difficulty problems that combine these topics. For example, a Sliding Window problem that uses a HashMap for tracking (related to Array) or a Greedy scheduling problem that requires sorting an array. Time yourself (45 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.

**Week 5: Hard Problem & Mock Interviews.**
Dedicate this week to tackling Hard problems. Don't aim to solve them quickly on the first try. Instead, spend 60-90 minutes deeply analyzing the problem, then study the optimal solution. Understand how it integrates multiple patterns. Conduct at least 2-3 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform, verbalizing your thought process throughout.

**Week 6: Review & Company-Specific Practice.**
Revisit all problems you struggled with. Solve Chubb-specific questions from your target year if available. Focus on internalizing the patterns, not memorizing solutions. Ensure you can derive the logic for Prefix Sum or a Greedy proof from first principles.

## Key Tips

1.  **Pattern Recognition is Everything:** When you read a problem, immediately ask: "Is this a contiguous subarray problem? (Sliding Window/Prefix Sum). Is it about making optimal choices step-by-step? (Greedy)." Labeling the problem type is 80% of the battle.
2.  **Communicate Your Greedy Proof:** For Greedy algorithm questions, be prepared to briefly justify _why_ your greedy choice is safe and leads to an optimal solution. A simple "This works because at each step, choosing the X with the smallest Y ensures we never close off a better future option" shows deep understanding.
3.  **Optimize Incrementally:** If a brute-force solution is obvious, state it first, then analyze its complexity. Explicitly say, "We can optimize this from O(n²) to O(n) by using a Sliding Window with a Prefix Sum," before coding the optimal version. This showcases your problem-solving trajectory.
4.  **Practice with Insurance-Scenario Adjacents:** While problems are generic, practicing questions related to scheduling, resource allocation, risk assessment (max/min problems), and time-series data (sliding windows on sequences) can be beneficial due to the domain.

Mastering these patterns and executing this focused plan will systematically prepare you for the specific challenges of a Chubb coding interview.
