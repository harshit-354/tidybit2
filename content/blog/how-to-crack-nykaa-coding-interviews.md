Nykaa’s technical interview process is designed to assess strong foundational coding skills and problem-solving agility. Candidates typically face one or two coding rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or through live pair-programming sessions. The problems are practical and lean towards efficient implementation, reflecting the company's e-commerce and logistics scale.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, the coding question distribution is revealing: 0% Easy, 75% Medium, and 25% Hard. This breakdown signals a clear expectation. Nykaa isn't screening for basic syntax recall; they are testing for robust, optimized problem-solving under constraints. The absence of "Easy" questions means the interview starts at a significant level of complexity. You must be comfortable with Medium-difficulty problems—these form the core of the interview and are your ticket to advancing. The single Hard question acts as a differentiator, often targeting optimal greedy solutions or advanced applications of core data structures. Your goal should be to confidently solve all Medium problems and have a structured approach to tackle the Hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Binary Search, Greedy, and Sorting. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array & String:** These are the fundamental data carriers. Problems often involve in-place manipulation, sliding windows, or two-pointer techniques to achieve O(1) space or O(n) time.
- **Binary Search:** Look for application beyond simple sorted array search. Nykaa problems may involve binary search on answer (monotonic functions) or in rotated arrays.
- **Greedy:** A favorite for Hard problems. The challenge is recognizing the correct greedy property and proving (or at least arguing) its optimality.
- **Sorting:** Frequently a preprocessing step. Understanding the performance trade-offs of different sorting algorithms is key.

A critical pattern that combines Array manipulation and the Two-Pointer technique is solving the "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array" problem in-place. This tests fundamental understanding of array indices and efficient traversal.

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write_index = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[write_index] = nums[i]
            write_index += 1
    return write_index
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let writeIndex = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[writeIndex] = nums[i];
      writeIndex++;
    }
  }
  return writeIndex;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int writeIndex = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[writeIndex] = nums[i];
            writeIndex++;
        }
    }
    return writeIndex;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics
Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Strings, and Sorting. Solve 15-20 Medium problems on each topic. Focus on patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sum for arrays; character counting and parsing for strings. Implement quick sort and merge sort from scratch.

Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Greedy
Deep dive into Binary Search (especially on answer) and Greedy algorithms. Solve 10-15 problems from each. For Greedy, start with classic problems (e.g., activity selection, coin change) to build intuition for identifying optimal local choices.

Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews
Stop learning new topics. Revisit all previously solved problems, focusing on writing clean, bug-free code quickly. Simulate the interview environment: solve 2-3 mixed-topic Medium/Hard problems in a 60-90 minute block. Analyze your thought process aloud.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First for Time, Then for Space.** Nykaa's scale makes efficiency paramount. Always state the brute-force solution's complexity, then immediately optimize. A correct O(n log n) solution is better than an incomplete O(n) attempt.
2.  **Communicate Your Trade-offs.** When presenting a solution, explicitly discuss why you chose a particular data structure or algorithm. For example, "I'm using a hash map for O(1) lookups, which increases space to O(n) but reduces time from O(n²) to O(n)."
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your code done, verbally run through edge cases: empty input, single element, sorted/reverse-sorted arrays, and large values. This demonstrates thoroughness.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** Turn off auto-complete and syntax highlighting during practice sessions. This mimics most interview environments and improves your accuracy and recall.

Consistent, pattern-focused practice on core topics is the most reliable method to succeed. Start with fundamentals, pressure-test with timed sessions, and always articulate your reasoning.
