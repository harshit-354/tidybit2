When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and difficulty of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Yandex and Roblox, while both prominent in their respective domains, present distinct interview landscapes. Yandex, a Russian multinational known for search, AI, and e-commerce, has a large, well-documented set of problems. Roblox, the user-generated gaming platform, has a smaller but still challenging set. A direct comparison of their question profiles reveals clear strategic differences for candidates.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is sheer volume. Yandex's catalog of approximately 134 questions is more than double Roblox's 56. This suggests Yandex's interview process may draw from a broader pool of concepts or that their question bank has been more extensively documented by the community.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Yandex (E52/M72/H10):** The emphasis is heavily on Medium-difficulty questions (72 out of 134), with a substantial number of Easy problems. Hard questions are relatively rare. This points to an interview that tests strong fundamentals and the application of core algorithms under pressure, rather than esoteric, ultra-complex problems.
- **Roblox (E8/M36/H12):** The distribution is skewed more toward challenge. While Mediums are still the majority, the proportion of Hard questions is higher than at Yandex, and Easy questions are fewer. This indicates that Roblox interviews may expect candidates to tackle more intricate optimization or system design problems from the outset.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize foundational data structures, as seen in their top topics: **Array, Hash Table, and String**. This universal focus makes mastering these areas the highest-return investment for any software engineering interview.

The key differences in their listed specialties reveal their engineering priorities:

- **Yandex** includes **Two Pointers** as a top topic. This is a classic technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists, often related to search, comparison, or windowing algorithms. It's a staple for optimizing solutions that might otherwise be O(n²).
- **Roblox** lists **Math** as a core topic. This aligns with the needs of a gaming and simulation platform, where problems involving geometry, probability, game mechanics, or numerical computation are more prevalent.

Here is a classic problem that could appear at either company, solved with their respective highlighted techniques:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers approach (Yandex-relevant)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Hash Table approach (Common to both)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers approach (Yandex-relevant)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Hash Table approach (Common to both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers approach (Yandex-relevant)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Hash Table approach (Common to both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your fundamentals and timeline.

**Start with Roblox if:** You are already comfortable with core data structures and want to challenge yourself with a higher density of Medium and Hard problems. Its smaller question bank allows for deeper, more repeated practice on each problem, which is excellent for mastering pattern application under tougher constraints.

**Start with Yandex if:** You are building or solidifying your foundation. The larger number of Easy and Medium problems provides a broader set of practice material to internalize fundamental patterns like Two Pointers, which are widely applicable. The volume helps build stamina and fluency.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in core topics means preparation for one directly benefits the other. A robust strategy is to use Yandex's extensive Medium-question bank for breadth and pattern recognition, then sharpen your problem-solving edge with Roblox's more difficult set. Mastery of Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings, supplemented with practice on Two Pointers and Math, will make you competitive for both.
