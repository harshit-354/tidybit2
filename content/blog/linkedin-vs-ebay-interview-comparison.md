When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. LinkedIn and eBay represent two distinct tiers in both question volume and focus areas, requiring tailored preparation strategies.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

LinkedIn's question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With 180 total questions, its distribution (26 Easy, 117 Medium, 37 Hard) reveals a heavy emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. This suggests LinkedIn's interviews are designed to thoroughly assess problem-solving and coding proficiency under typical interview constraints. The substantial number of questions indicates a broader set of patterns to master.

eBay's list is more manageable at 60 questions, with a distribution of 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard. The focus is also on Medium problems, but the smaller overall volume implies a more predictable interview loop. The lower proportion of Hard questions suggests slightly less emphasis on highly complex algorithmic optimization compared to LinkedIn.

**Example Medium Question (Two Sum):**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** fundamentals. These form the core of data manipulation and lookup problems. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, which is prominent on LinkedIn's list but absent from eBay's stated focus. This indicates LinkedIn frequently assesses tree and graph traversal, a common topic for higher-complexity problems. eBay's list explicitly includes **Sorting**, a more foundational algorithmic technique.

**Example DFS Question (Binary Tree Paths):**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def binaryTreePaths(root):
    def dfs(node, path):
        if not node:
            return
        path.append(str(node.val))
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            paths.append("->".join(path))
        else:
            dfs(node.left, path)
            dfs(node.right, path)
        path.pop()

    paths = []
    dfs(root, [])
    return paths
```

```javascript
function binaryTreePaths(root) {
  const paths = [];
  function dfs(node, path) {
    if (!node) return;
    path.push(node.val.toString());
    if (!node.left && !node.right) {
      paths.push(path.join("->"));
    } else {
      dfs(node.left, path);
      dfs(node.right, path);
    }
    path.pop();
  }
  dfs(root, []);
  return paths;
}
```

```java
public List<String> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode root) {
    List<String> paths = new ArrayList<>();
    dfs(root, new StringBuilder(), paths);
    return paths;
}
private void dfs(TreeNode node, StringBuilder path, List<String> paths) {
    if (node == null) return;
    int len = path.length();
    if (len > 0) path.append("->");
    path.append(node.val);
    if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
        paths.add(path.toString());
    } else {
        dfs(node.left, path, paths);
        dfs(node.right, path, paths);
    }
    path.setLength(len);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **eBay first**. Its smaller, more focused question set allows you to solidify core competencies in Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting with a manageable time investment. Success here builds confidence and a strong foundation.

Once comfortable with eBay's patterns, transition to **LinkedIn** preparation. This requires expanding your study to include DFS and other graph-related algorithms, while also practicing a larger volume of Medium and Hard problems. The core skills from eBay preparation will directly apply, but you must allocate additional time for the increased breadth and depth.

Ultimately, eBay serves as an excellent stepping stone. Mastering its list creates a robust platform for tackling the more extensive and challenging landscape of a LinkedIn technical interview.
