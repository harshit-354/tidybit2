Stacks are a fundamental data structure that appear in 16% of all coding interview questions. With 140 questions tagged "Stack" on our platform, they're not just an academic exercise—they're a practical tool for solving real-world problems involving nested structures, reversals, and sequential processing. If you can recognize when to use a stack, you'll solve problems faster and write cleaner code.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Parentheses and Nested Validation

This is the most classic stack application. Use a stack to track opening brackets and ensure they close in the correct order. The pattern: push opening symbols, pop on a match when you see a closing symbol.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const map = { ")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "[" };
  for (const char of s) {
    if (map[char]) {
      if (stack.pop() !== map[char]) return false;
    } else {
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Character, Character> map = Map.of(')', '(', '}', '{', ']', '[');
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (map.containsKey(c)) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != map.get(c)) return false;
        } else {
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

</div>

### 2. Monotonic Stack

A monotonic stack maintains elements in either strictly increasing or decreasing order. It's perfect for problems like "next greater element" or "daily temperatures." The core idea: while the current element violates the monotonic order, pop from the stack and process.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures):
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []  # stores indices
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            answer[idx] = i - idx
        stack.append(i)
    return answer
```

```javascript
function dailyTemperatures(temperatures) {
  const n = temperatures.length;
  const answer = new Array(n).fill(0);
  const stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (stack.length && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
      const idx = stack.pop();
      answer[idx] = i - idx;
    }
    stack.push(i);
  }
  return answer;
}
```

```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    int n = temperatures.length;
    int[] answer = new int[n];
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack.peek()]) {
            int idx = stack.pop();
            answer[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    return answer;
}
```

</div>

### 3. Stack for DFS and Expression Evaluation

Stacks naturally implement Depth-First Search (DFS) on trees and graphs without recursion. They're also essential for evaluating postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) expressions or parsing nested commands.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 140 Stack questions split as:

- **Easy: 23 (16%)** – These test basic operations (push, pop) and simple validation. Master these first.
- **Medium: 78 (56%)** – The core of stack interviews. Expect monotonic stacks, combined data structures, and multi-step logic.
- **Hard: 39 (28%)** – Often involve stacks combined with other concepts (DP, greedy algorithms) or complex simulations.

The 56% medium majority means you must be comfortable with pattern adaptation. A hard problem is usually a medium stack pattern layered with additional constraints.

## Which Companies Ask Stack

Stack questions are universal, but some companies emphasize them more:

- **[Google](/company/google)** – Loves stack-based parsing and simulation problems.
- **[Amazon](/company/amazon)** – Frequently asks for stack solutions in online assessment rounds.
- **[Meta](/company/meta)** – Uses stacks for nested UI component and expression evaluation scenarios.
- **[Microsoft](/company/microsoft)** – Often includes stack problems in phone screens.
- **[Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg)** – Heavy on real-time data streaming problems solvable with stacks.

## Study Tips

1. **Recognize the "Last-In, First-Out" need** – If a problem involves reversing, tracking the most recent element, or handling nested structures, think stack.
2. **Practice monotonic stacks until automatic** – This pattern is non-negotiable for medium/hard questions. Write the "next greater element" solution from memory.
3. **Simulate with a physical stack** – Use paper or a whiteboard to manually run through push/pop sequences for complex problems like "largest rectangle in histogram."
4. **Combine with other structures** – Practice using stacks alongside hash maps (for O(1) lookups) or queues (for hybrid problems).

Mastering these patterns turns stack problems from confusing to systematic.
