When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly increase your efficiency. TikTok and Uber, while both major players, have distinct engineering challenges reflected in their interview question banks. A direct comparison of their most frequently asked questions reveals key differences in difficulty emphasis and topic weighting, allowing you to tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total volume of frequently asked questions is nearly identical: TikTok has 383 questions and Uber has 381. The primary difference lies in the distribution of difficulty.

**TikTok's** breakdown is 42 Easy, 260 Medium, and 81 Hard questions. This shows a strong concentration on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which comprise about 68% of their question bank. This suggests TikTok interviews heavily test core algorithmic competency and clean implementation under typical constraints.

**Uber's** breakdown is 54 Easy, 224 Medium, and 103 Hard questions. While Medium problems are still the majority (~59%), Uber has a **significantly higher proportion of Hard questions**—roughly 27% compared to TikTok's 21%. This indicates Uber's process may involve more complex problem-solving, often requiring optimization for edge cases or combining multiple concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a core set of data structures and algorithms. Their top four topics are identical, though in slightly different orders:

- **TikTok:** Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
- **Uber:** Array, Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming

This high overlap means foundational preparation is universally beneficial. Mastering array manipulation, string algorithms, efficient lookups with hash tables, and dynamic programming will serve you well for both.

The emphasis on **Arrays** and **Hash Tables** points to both companies' focus on real-time data processing—whether it's managing user feed data (TikTok) or coordinating spatial/ride data (Uber). **Dynamic Programming** is critical for optimization problems, which are common in scaling systems and finding efficient routes or recommendations.

Here is a typical pattern that combines these topics, such as finding a subarray with a specific sum:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    sum_map = {0: 1}  # Hash Table storing prefix sums

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num  # Array traversal
        # Check if (prefix_sum - k) exists
        count += sum_map.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Store current prefix sum
        sum_map[prefix_sum] = sum_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumMap = new Map(); // Hash Table
  sumMap.set(0, 1);

  for (const num of nums) {
    // Array traversal
    prefixSum += num;
    if (sumMap.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumMap.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    sumMap.set(prefixSum, (sumMap.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>(); // Hash Table
    sumMap.put(0, 1);

    for (int num : nums) { // Array traversal
        prefixSum += num;
        count += sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        sumMap.put(prefixSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared core topics**. A strong grasp of Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and Dynamic Programming will build a foundation applicable to both companies. Practice a mix of Medium problems from general LeetCode categories.

If you are interviewing at **both companies**, prepare for **Uber first**. Its higher density of Hard questions means that succeeding in Uber-style practice will naturally cover the complexity needed for TikTok's hardest questions, while also ensuring you are comfortable with more intricate problem-solving. Conversely, focusing only on TikTok's Medium-heavy list might leave you underprepared for Uber's toughest rounds.

Ultimately, your preparation should be guided by the company's domain. TikTok's focus might lean more towards string processing (for content) and array algorithms (for feed ranking), while Uber's might involve more graph-like reasoning on arrays (for locations) and optimization (for routing). Tailor your final practice sessions to these nuances.
