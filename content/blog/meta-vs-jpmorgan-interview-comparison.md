When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Meta and JPMorgan represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum: one is a top-tier tech giant with a rigorous, algorithm-heavy process, and the other is a leading financial institution with a more focused, practical coding assessment. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most striking difference. Meta's tagged question bank on TidyBit is **1387 questions**, dwarfing JPMorgan's **78 questions**. This reflects Meta's vast, well-documented interview history and its status as a primary target for competitive software engineers globally.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different bars:

- **Meta (E414/M762/H211):** The curve is centered on **Medium** difficulty. Over 55% of questions are Medium, with a significant number of Hard problems. This signals an interview process designed to deeply test algorithmic reasoning, optimal solution design, and performance under pressure for complex scenarios.
- **JPMorgan (E25/M45/H8):** The distribution also leans toward **Medium**, but the total count is far lower, and Hard questions are minimal. This suggests a focus on assessing solid foundational coding skills, logical thinking, and the ability to solve common programming problems efficiently, rather than tackling obscure algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume gap, there is strong core alignment in the fundamental topics tested. Both companies prioritize:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Hash Table**

This overlap is your strategic advantage. Mastering these three topics provides a strong foundation for both interview processes. The key difference lies in depth and context.

At Meta, a Hash Table question is often a stepping stone to a more complex optimization problem involving two pointers or dynamic programming. At JPMorgan, it might be a more direct application for counting or grouping data.

JPMorgan's list includes **Sorting** as a top topic, which is a practical, fundamental operation. While Sorting is inherently crucial for many Meta problems, it's less frequently called out as a primary tag because it's often a component within a more advanced pattern.

**Example: Two Sum**
This classic problem perfectly illustrates the shared foundation but potential divergence in follow-ups.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python: Basic solution using a hash map (dictionary).
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: Same hash map approach.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Java: Implementation using a HashMap.
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

A JPMorgan interview might stop here, testing your knowledge of hash tables for efficient lookups. A Meta interview is likely to use this as a warm-up before progressing to "3Sum" or "4Sum," which require combining hash tables with sorting and two-pointer techniques.

## Which to Prepare for First

You should **prepare for JPMorgan first**. Here’s why:

1.  **Foundation First:** JPMorgan's question set is a concise, high-yield list of foundational problems. Mastering these 78 questions will solidify your skills in the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) that are also essential for Meta.
2.  **Efficient Ramp-Up:** You can achieve readiness for a JPMorgan-style interview much faster. This builds confidence and provides a concrete milestone.
3.  **Scalable Core:** The core techniques you perfect for JPMorgan are exactly the building blocks needed to tackle Meta's more extensive Medium and Hard problems. You will not waste effort.

Once comfortable with the JPMorgan set, transition to Meta preparation by:

- Deepening your knowledge in the same core topics, practicing more varied and complex problems.
- Systematically studying advanced patterns prevalent in Meta's list, such as Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees, and Recursion.
- Practicing under timed conditions to build the speed and stamina required for Meta's intensive coding rounds.

In short, use JPMorgan's focused list to build a robust coding foundation, then expand your scope and depth to meet Meta's high bar for algorithmic excellence.
