When preparing for technical interviews at major Korean tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study. Samsung and Coupang, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in their question libraries on TidyBit. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in the scale and depth of their respective question sets.

**Samsung** has a larger library with **69 questions**, categorized as 15 Easy, 37 Medium, and 17 Hard. This higher volume, especially in the Hard category, suggests a more extensive and potentially more rigorous interview process. The distribution indicates you must be comfortable with a wide range of problems, with a strong emphasis on solving complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges (the 17 Hard questions). Preparing for Samsung means being ready for a stamina test of problem-solving.

**Coupang**'s library is smaller at **53 questions**, with a distribution of 3 Easy, 36 Medium, and 14 Hard. The near-absence of Easy questions is striking; the interview focuses almost entirely on Medium and Hard difficulty. This profile suggests Coupang interviews dive quickly into substantial algorithmic problems, testing for depth of understanding and the ability to handle optimization under pressure. The slightly lower total volume compared to Samsung may indicate a slightly more focused, but no less intense, interview loop.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures and algorithms, with significant overlap in their top four topics.

The **core shared topics** are:

- **Array**: Fundamental to most problems.
- **Hash Table**: Crucial for efficient lookups and frequency counting.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: A key area for medium and hard problems, testing optimal substructure thinking.

**Samsung's** unique emphasis, as shown by its fourth top topic, is **Two Pointers**. This technique is often used in array and string manipulation for problems involving sorted data, palindromes, or sliding windows. Its prominence suggests Samsung frequently asks problems that require in-place operations or efficient traversal patterns.

**Coupang's** distinctive focus is on **String** manipulation. Placing String as its second most frequent topic indicates a high likelihood of encountering problems involving parsing, matching, transforming, or analyzing string data, which often requires careful handling of edge cases and indices.

```python
# Example highlighting Two Pointers (common in Samsung)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]

# Example highlighting String manipulation (common in Coupang)
def is_valid_parenthesis(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

```javascript
// Example highlighting Two Pointers (common in Samsung)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}

// Example highlighting String manipulation (common in Coupang)
function isValidParenthesis(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const map = { ")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "[" };
  for (const char of s) {
    if (map[char]) {
      if (stack.pop() !== map[char]) return false;
    } else {
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

```java
// Example highlighting Two Pointers (common in Samsung)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}

// Example highlighting String manipulation (common in Coupang)
public boolean isValidParenthesis(String s) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Character, Character> map = Map.of(')', '(', '}', '{', ']', '[');
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (map.containsKey(c)) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != map.get(c)) return false;
        } else {
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your timeline and the breadth of your target companies.

**Prepare for Samsung first if:** You are interviewing with Samsung specifically, or you want to build the broadest possible foundation. Samsung's larger and more difficult question set covers a wider range of problems. Mastering its library, particularly the Hard problems and Two Pointers technique, will inherently cover much of the core material needed for Coupang (Arrays, Hash Tables, DP). It's the more comprehensive, and thus more time-consuming, preparation path.

**Prepare for Coupang first if:** Your primary target is Coupang, or you need to get interview-ready on a tighter schedule. Focusing on Coupang's set forces you to drill deeply into Medium and Hard problems on core topics and string manipulation. This creates a strong, focused skill set. You can then efficiently layer on additional practice for Samsung-specific patterns like Two Pointers.

A strategic hybrid approach is to **build a core foundation** using the shared topics (Array, Hash Table, DP), then **branch out** based on your target: practice String problems heavily for Coupang, and Two Pointers for Samsung. Regardless of the order, solving a significant portion of the Medium and Hard problems from either company's list is non-negotiable for success.
