Arista Networks coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving with an emphasis on networking-adjacent logic, though the core remains data structures and algorithms. The process typically involves 1-2 technical rounds of live coding, often using platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank, where you'll write, run, and debug code. Expect follow-up questions on time/space complexity and edge cases. The goal is to assess clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 43 Arista Networks questions reveals a clear profile: 10 Easy (23%), 31 Medium (72%), and 2 Hard (5%). This distribution is telling. The overwhelming majority are Medium-difficulty problems, indicating the interview bar is set at consistent, competent implementation of standard algorithms. You won't often face obscure, research-level Hard problems. Instead, the challenge is applying well-known patterns—like two-pointers, BFS, or dynamic programming—to moderately complex scenarios, often with a focus on data manipulation (Arrays, Strings) and efficient lookup (Hash Tables). The few Hard problems test deeper optimization, while the Easy ones serve as warm-ups or test for fundamental gaps. Your preparation should be laser-focused on mastering Medium-tier problems across the core topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows where to direct your energy. Master these areas.

**Array (Top Topic):** Central to most problems, often involving in-place manipulation, searching, or subarray calculations. The **Sliding Window** pattern is crucial for optimal subarray/ substring problems.

**String:** Frequently tested for parsing, comparison, and transformation. Know how to efficiently handle concatenation, reversal, and pattern matching.

**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or mapping relationships.

**Linked List:** Tests pointer manipulation and traversal logic. Be comfortable with reversal, cycle detection, and merging lists.

**Dynamic Programming:** Appears in optimization problems (e.g., max/min, ways to do something). Start with the classic 1D/2D patterns for Fibonacci, knapsack, or longest common subsequence.

For the top topic (Array), the Sliding Window pattern is a must-know. Here’s a template for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        # If duplicate found, move left pointer
        if ch in char_index and char_index[ch] >= left:
            left = char_index[ch] + 1
        # Update the character's latest index
        char_index[ch] = right
        # Update max length
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const ch = s[right];
    // If duplicate found, move left pointer
    if (charIndex.has(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
    }
    // Update the character's latest index
    charIndex.set(ch, right);
    // Update max length
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(right);
        // If duplicate found, move left pointer
        if (charIndex.containsKey(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
        }
        // Update the character's latest index
        charIndex.put(ch, right);
        // Update max length
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here’s a week-by-week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, String, Hash Table, Linked List, DP), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on internalizing the core patterns: two-pointers for Arrays/Strings, frequency maps with Hash Tables, pointer manipulation for Linked Lists, and state transition for DP. Write code for every problem—don't just think about it.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed.** Shift to mixed-topic problem sets. Use platforms that randomize question topics to simulate interview conditions. Time yourself: aim for 25-30 minutes per Medium problem, including explaining your approach. Start each problem by explicitly naming the pattern you'll use (e.g., "This is a sliding window problem because we need a contiguous subarray...").

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** Conduct at least 4-6 mock interviews with a peer or using recorded sessions. Target Arista's style: a 45-minute session with one Medium or one Medium-plus-follow-up. Analyze your weak spots—is it debugging under pressure, explaining trade-offs, or a specific pattern like graph traversal? Dedicate the final days to drilling those weaknesses with focused problem sets.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Aloud.** From the moment you read the problem, verbalize your thoughts. Outline the brute force, identify bottlenecks, then propose the optimized approach. This turns a silent coding session into a collaborative problem-solving demonstration.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First, Optimization Second.** Write a working brute-force solution if needed, then optimize. A bug-free, slightly slower solution is better than a broken, "optimal" one. Interviewers want to see logical progression.
3.  **Test with Small, Edge, and Large Cases.** After writing code, don't just run the given example. Manually step through a small custom case, then test edges (empty input, single element, large values). Finally, reason about scalability.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions Immediately.** Before coding, confirm assumptions about input format, return values, and edge case handling (e.g., "Can the array be empty?"). This prevents costly mid-problem course corrections.
5.  **Practice in a Plain Text Editor.** Turn off auto-complete and syntax highlighting during some practice sessions. Interviews often use bare-bones editors, and you need to be comfortable without IDE crutches.

Success in an Arista interview hinges on methodical preparation for Medium-difficulty problems across core data structures. Build pattern recognition through volume, then refine it through timed practice and clear communication.
