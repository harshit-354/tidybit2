When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution of their questions can significantly streamline your study process. Walmart Labs and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok) are both prominent in the tech landscape, but their interview question profiles, as reflected in aggregated coding platforms, show distinct patterns in volume, difficulty, and topical emphasis. This comparison analyzes their question banks to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of documented questions. Walmart Labs has a significantly larger pool with **152 questions**, compared to ByteDance's **64 questions**. This suggests that preparing for Walmart Labs might require covering a broader range of problem scenarios or that their question bank has been documented over a longer period.

The difficulty distribution also differs markedly:

- **Walmart Labs (E22/M105/H25):** The majority of questions are Medium (105), with a substantial number of Hard (25) and a smaller set of Easy (22). This indicates an interview process heavily weighted towards complex problem-solving, with a strong filter for algorithmic proficiency.
- **ByteDance (E6/M49/H9):** The distribution follows a similar pattern but is less extreme. Medium questions still dominate (49), but the proportion of Hard questions (9) is lower relative to the total. The number of Easy questions (6) is also minimal. This points to an interview that is challenging but may have a slightly more focused core on standard medium-difficulty problems.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the difference in volume, both companies show a strong convergence on four fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**.

This overlap is critical. It means that deep mastery of these areas is essential for both interviews. You can expect problems involving string manipulation, two-pointer techniques on arrays, frequency counting with hash maps, and both 1D and 2D dynamic programming.

**Example: A common overlapping problem could be checking for a palindromic substring.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    def expand(l, r):
        while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
            l -= 1
            r += 1
        return s[l+1:r]
    res = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        odd = expand(i, i)
        even = expand(i, i+1)
        res = max(res, odd, even, key=len)
    return res
```

```javascript
function longestPalindrome(s) {
  let res = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const odd = expand(i, i);
    const even = expand(i, i + 1);
    if (odd.length > res.length) res = odd;
    if (even.length > res.length) res = even;
  }
  function expand(l, r) {
    while (l >= 0 && r < s.length && s[l] === s[r]) {
      l--;
      r++;
    }
    return s.substring(l + 1, r);
  }
  return res;
}
```

```java
public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
    if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";
    int start = 0, end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        int len1 = expand(s, i, i);
        int len2 = expand(s, i, i + 1);
        int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
        if (len > end - start) {
            start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
            end = i + len / 2;
        }
    }
    return s.substring(start, end + 1);
}
private int expand(String s, int left, int right) {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return right - left - 1;
}
```

Given the shared focus, excelling in these core topics will build a strong foundation for either company.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both companies, or are using one as practice for the other, **start with ByteDance**. Here's why:

1.  **Focused Foundation:** ByteDance's smaller, medium-dominant question bank allows you to solidify the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) efficiently. Mastering these ~64 questions, especially the Medium ones, creates an excellent baseline.
2.  **Progressive Difficulty:** After building confidence with ByteDance's profile, transitioning to Walmart Labs becomes a matter of **scale and depth**. You will be adding more Medium problems and a significant number of Hard problems to your practice, expanding your problem-solving stamina and ability to handle more complex edge cases. This is a more logical progression than starting with the larger, harder set and potentially becoming overwhelmed.
3.  **Efficient Overlap:** Since the core topics are identical, almost all the effort spent preparing for ByteDance directly applies to Walmart Labs. You are not studying separate domains; you are progressively increasing the volume and difficulty within the same domains.

In summary, use ByteDance's focused question set to build core competency, then use Walmart Labs' extensive and challenging bank to stress-test and broaden your skills. This approach maximizes the utility of your study time for both interview loops.
