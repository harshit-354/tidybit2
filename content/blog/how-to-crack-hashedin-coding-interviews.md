Hashedin Technologies (now part of Accenture) is known for a rigorous, multi-stage technical interview process. Candidates typically face an online assessment followed by multiple rounds of live coding, system design, and behavioral discussions. The coding interviews focus heavily on problem-solving, clean code, and the efficient application of core data structures and algorithms. Success requires targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 32 Hashedin coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 5 Easy (16%), 20 Medium (63%), and 7 Hard (22%). This breakdown is telling. The overwhelming majority of problems are at the Medium level, which is the core battlefield. These questions test your ability to identify the correct data structure, apply a known algorithmic pattern, and handle edge cases under time pressure. The significant presence of Hard problems (over one-fifth) indicates that to stand out, especially for senior roles, you must be comfortable with complex optimization, advanced dynamic programming, or intricate graph manipulations. Don't neglect Easy problems—they are often used as quick screening questions or as parts of a larger problem. Your preparation should be centered on mastering Medium problems while building the stamina and depth to tackle a Hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Dynamic Programming, String, Hash Table, and Greedy algorithms. Here’s how to prioritize them.

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving subarrays, sorting, two-pointer techniques, and binary search on modified arrays. Master in-place operations and sliding windows.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical differentiator. Hashedin frequently uses DP for optimization problems. You must be able to define states, transitions, and handle 1D and 2D DP. Start with classic problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and maximum subarray.
- **String:** Often combined with other topics. Focus on palindrome checks, anagram grouping, string transformations, and pattern matching (though not necessarily full regex). Know how to efficiently manipulate and compare strings.
- **Hash Table:** Your primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, duplicate detection, and complement searching (like Two Sum). Understand its implementation and collision trade-offs.
- **Greedy:** Used for problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum. Common in interval scheduling, coin change (with specific denominations), and task scheduling. Knowing when a greedy approach is valid is key.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is paramount for Array and String problems, especially when dealing with subarrays or substrings with specific conditions. Here is a template for the variable-size window pattern to find the longest substring with at most K distinct characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Expand window by adding char at 'right'
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # Shrink window from left if condition violated
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # Update answer
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // Expand window
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    // Shrink window if condition violated
    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    // Update answer
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // Expand window
        char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(rightChar, charCount.getOrDefault(rightChar, 0) + 1);

        // Shrink window if condition violated
        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Update answer
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Spend the first two weeks intensively covering the top five topics. For each topic (Array, DP, String, Hash Table, Greedy), solve 8-10 curated problems spanning Easy to Medium. Focus on understanding patterns, not just solutions. Implement each solution in your primary language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews.** Shift to solving mixed-topic Medium problems. This simulates the actual interview where the category isn't given. Begin each problem by identifying the pattern (e.g., "This is a sliding window problem on an array"). Start doing timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes) with a peer or using online platforms. Dedicate time to understanding at least 2-3 Hard problem solutions per week to stretch your thinking.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Refinement.** In the final stretch, solve as many Hashedin-tagged problems as you can find. This gets you familiar with their problem style and difficulty curve. Revisit your weak areas—if DP is tricky, spend a day drilling only DP variations. Polish your communication: practice explaining your thought process aloud as you code.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process:** Don't dive into silent coding. Start by restating the problem, asking clarifying questions, discussing brute force, then optimizing. Explain the time and space complexity of your final solution before you start writing code.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Hashedin values clean, maintainable code. Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, handle edge cases explicitly (empty input, single element, large values), and write modular functions where appropriate.
3.  **Test with Examples:** After writing your code, don't just announce you're done. Walk through a standard test case and a couple of edge cases with your code. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches bugs you can fix on the spot.
4.  **Optimize Iteratively:** It's often better to present a working brute-force solution and then optimize it than to struggle in silence for 20 minutes trying to devise the perfect algorithm. Interviewers want to see your problem-solving journey.

Targeted, consistent practice on the right patterns is what separates candidates who pass from those who excel. Start with the core, build your stamina, and simulate the real environment.
