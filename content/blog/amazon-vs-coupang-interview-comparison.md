When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the landscape of questions you might face is crucial. Both Amazon and Coupang, as large-scale e-commerce and logistics giants, test core algorithmic and data structure proficiency. However, the scale and focus of their known interview question pools differ dramatically, which directly impacts preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is in the sheer volume of documented questions.

**Amazon** has a massive, well-established repository of **1,938 questions** (as per TidyBit data: 530 Easy, 1,057 Medium, 351 Hard). This vast pool reflects Amazon's long history of technical recruiting, its scale, and the variety of roles across countless teams (AWS, Retail, Alexa, etc.). Encountering a completely new question is a real possibility, making pattern recognition and fundamental understanding more valuable than rote memorization.

**Coupang**, often called "the Amazon of South Korea," has a significantly smaller public repository of **53 questions** (3 Easy, 36 Medium, 14 Hard). This smaller pool is typical for companies with a more regional focus or a less-documented interview history on public platforms. It suggests a higher chance of encountering a known problem, but preparation should not rely on this alone.

Regarding difficulty, both companies emphasize Medium-level problems. Amazon's distribution shows a heavy skew towards Medium, forming the core of their technical screen. Coupang's known list is almost entirely composed of Medium and Hard questions, indicating their on-site rounds likely focus on complex problem-solving.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume difference, there is near-perfect alignment in the core technical topics tested. Both companies heavily prioritize:

- **Array & String Manipulation:** Essential for data processing.
- **Hash Table Usage:** Critical for optimizing lookups and solving frequency-count problems.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key indicator of advanced problem-solving for optimization challenges.

This overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both interviews. The question _types_ within these topics will differ in scale and specific context. Amazon questions might be wrapped in scenarios about logistics, warehouses, or customer data, while Coupang's may relate to its famous rocket delivery network or e-commerce platform.

```python
# Example: A Hash Table & String problem common to both.
def first_unique_char(s: str) -> int:
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if freq[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: A Hash Table & String problem common to both.
function firstUniqueChar(s) {
  const freq = new Map();
  for (const char of s) {
    freq.set(char, (freq.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (freq.get(s[i]) === 1) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: A Hash Table & String problem common to both.
public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (freq.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Amazon first**. Here’s why:

1.  **Foundational Coverage:** Mastering Amazon's vast question set inherently builds deep competency in the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) that Coupang also tests. The reverse is not true; studying Coupang's 53 questions alone leaves massive gaps for Amazon.
2.  **Difficulty Benchmark:** Amazon's large Medium-heavy set is an excellent training ground. If you can reliably solve Medium-level problems under interview conditions, you are well-positioned for the core of Coupang's interview as well.
3.  **Efficiency:** This approach creates a strong, generalizable skill set. After building this foundation, you can efficiently tailor your preparation for Coupang by reviewing its specific, smaller question set to understand any unique nuances or problem contexts.

In short, use Amazon's extensive problem bank as your primary training gym to build muscle memory for core algorithms. Then, shift to studying Coupang's specific list to familiarize yourself with their problem flavor and to practice any harder problems that may appear. This strategy maximizes your preparedness for both companies.
