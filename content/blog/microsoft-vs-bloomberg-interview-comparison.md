When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Microsoft and Bloomberg are both prestigious targets for software engineers, but their interview question profiles reveal distinct patterns. This comparison breaks down the volume, difficulty, and core topics for each, providing a clear roadmap for your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant difference in both the total number of questions and their difficulty distribution, which reflects each company's interview philosophy.

**Microsoft** has a larger overall question pool (**1352 questions**), suggesting a broader range of potential problems. The difficulty breakdown is heavily weighted toward medium-level questions (M762), with a substantial number of easy (E379) and a smaller, yet critical, set of hard problems (H211). This indicates that while a strong grasp of fundamentals is essential, candidates must be exceptionally proficient at solving medium-difficulty algorithmic challenges under interview conditions. The hard problems often involve complex dynamic programming or intricate system design elements.

**Bloomberg** has a slightly smaller question pool (**1173 questions**), with a different difficulty spread. It has the highest count of easy questions (E391) among the data shown, a strong set of medium problems (M625), and notably fewer hard questions (H157) than Microsoft. This profile suggests Bloomberg interviews may place a greater initial emphasis on foundational correctness, problem-solving clarity, and communication, while still rigorously testing algorithmic skill with medium-difficulty problems. The lower count of hard questions implies that ultra-complex algorithm optimization might be slightly less frequent than at Microsoft.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong, fundamental focus on **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These are the bedrock of algorithmic interviews, testing data manipulation, efficient lookup, and basic problem-solving.

The key differentiator lies in their fourth most frequent topic:

- **Microsoft** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with its reputation for asking complex, optimization-heavy problems, particularly in later interview rounds. Mastery of DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, state machines) is non-negotiable.
- **Bloomberg** highlights **Math** as a core topic. This reflects the quantitative and financial data aspects of its domain. Expect more problems involving number theory, probabilities, calculations, and mathematical modeling.

Here is a classic problem that could appear at either company, solved using a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by the foundational overlap and your target companies.

**Start with the shared core.** Begin your study with **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. This builds the essential skills applicable to both companies. Focus on achieving speed and fluency on easy and medium problems in these areas.

If your goal is **Microsoft**, you must prioritize **Dynamic Programming** early in your study plan after mastering the core. DP has a steep learning curve and requires significant practice to recognize patterns and implement solutions under pressure. The large number of medium Microsoft questions also means you should practice solving a wide variety of problems efficiently.

If your goal is **Bloomberg**, ensure your **mathematical reasoning** is sharp. Review basic number theory, combinatorics, and probability. Practice translating word problems into mathematical models or efficient algorithms. While the hard problem count is lower, do not neglect them, as they will likely differentiate top candidates.

Ultimately, preparing for the broader and slightly more difficult Microsoft question set will make you well-equipped for Bloomberg's technical screen. The reverse is less true due to Microsoft's emphasis on advanced DP. A strategic approach is to master the common core, then deep-dive into DP for Microsoft or math-focused problems for Bloomberg.
