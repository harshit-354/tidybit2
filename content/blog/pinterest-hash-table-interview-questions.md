Hash tables are fundamental at Pinterest because they power core features at scale. With over 450 million monthly users, Pinterest’s systems rely on efficient data retrieval for personalization, content deduplication, real-time analytics, and session management. For example, when you see your personalized home feed, backend services are likely using hash-based structures to quickly fetch your board data, pin recommendations, and followed topics. Similarly, detecting duplicate image uploads or managing user sessions across distributed systems often boils down to efficient key-value lookups. Mastering hash tables demonstrates you can design solutions that are both correct and performant under the constraints of a massive platform.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Pinterest’s hash table questions typically focus on practical applications rather than abstract theory. You can expect problems in these categories:

1.  **Frequency Analysis & Counting:** The most common type. Tasks like finding the most frequent pins in a log, identifying duplicate image hashes, or analyzing user interaction patterns.
2.  **Data Deduplication & Caching:** Problems involving removing duplicates from a data stream or implementing a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) cache mechanism, which is critical for performance.
3.  **Mapping & Lookup for Optimization:** Using a hash map to store precomputed results (memoization) to turn an inefficient O(n²) solution into an O(n) one. This is common in problems involving pair sums or complementary tasks.
4.  **System Design Components:** While not a pure algorithm question, you might discuss how you’d use a distributed hash table (like a key-value store) in a high-level design for a feature like real-time search term autocomplete.

The problems are designed to test your ability to recognize when a hash table is the optimal tool and to implement it cleanly.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on pattern recognition. The core pattern is: _if you need to track, count, or look up elements for constant-time access, use a hash table._ Practice writing the boilerplate for hash maps/dictionaries/sets in your language of choice until it’s automatic.

A key pattern is the **"Complement Lookup"** for problems like "Find two numbers that sum to a target." The brute-force solution checks all pairs (O(n²)). The optimal solution uses a hash map to store numbers we've seen and instantly check if the needed complement (target - current_number) exists.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Master Fundamentals:** `twoSum`, frequency counting, and deduplication.
2.  **Learn Common Variants:** Practice `groupAnagrams` and `containsDuplicate`.
3.  **Tackle Advanced Structures:** Implement an `LRUCache` from scratch. This combines hash maps with linked lists and is a classic Pinterest-level question.
4.  **Apply to Strings & Arrays:** Solve problems like `firstUniqChar` and `subarraySum` using hash maps for optimization.
5.  **Simulate Interview Conditions:** Finally, solve Pinterest’s tagged hash table problems on TidyBit under timed conditions.
