When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study process. PayPal and Intuit, while both prominent in the fintech and financial software space, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topic focus. A targeted comparison reveals how to allocate your preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw volume of reported questions is a strong indicator of the breadth of concepts you might encounter. PayPal's list, at 106 questions, is about 50% larger than Intuit's 71. This suggests PayPal's interview process may pull from a wider pool of problems or that candidates encounter a greater variety.

The difficulty breakdown offers more critical insight:

- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty (65% of questions), with a nearly even split between Easy and Hard questions. This profile is classic for large tech companies, emphasizing problem-solving under moderate constraints, with some simpler warm-ups and complex challenges to differentiate top candidates.
- **Intuit (E10/M47/H14):** The pattern is similar but more concentrated. A dominant **66%** of questions are Medium difficulty. The key difference is the lower proportion of Easy questions (14% vs PayPal's 17%), indicating interviews may dive into substantive problem-solving more quickly. The Hard question proportion is comparable (20% vs 18%).

This data implies that for both companies, mastering medium-difficulty problems is the absolute priority, but you may face slightly more introductory scaffolding at PayPal.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures, but with a notable shift in priority for one key area.

**Shared Core Topics:** **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** are top topics for both. Questions here often involve manipulation, searching, and frequency counting. A problem like "Two Sum" is a quintessential example for both.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

**Key Divergence:** The most significant difference is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. It is a **top-2 topic for Intuit** but does not appear in PayPal's top four. This signals that Intuit's interviews frequently assess optimization and recursive problem-solving for scenarios like maximizing profit or minimizing cost, which are common in financial contexts. PayPal's fourth top topic is **Sorting**, indicating more focus on organizing data and using sorted properties for efficient solutions.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by topic commonality and career goals.

1.  **Start with the Shared Foundation.** Begin by solidifying your skills in **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems at the Medium level. This core is directly applicable to both companies. Mastering patterns like two-pointers, sliding window, and frequency mapping will build a base for the majority of questions you'll see.
2.  **If targeting Intuit, prioritize Dynamic Programming next.** Given DP's prominence, dedicate significant time to foundational DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence, climbing stairs variants) and their optimization. This is a critical differentiator for their interviews.
3.  **If targeting PayPal, deepen Sorting and associated algorithms.** Understand efficient sorting (quicksort, mergesort) and, more importantly, how to leverage sorting to solve problems (e.g., meeting intervals, anagrams, Kth largest element). Then, address their broader question volume by practicing a wide variety of Medium problems.
4.  **General Strategy:** Due to its larger question pool and slightly more balanced difficulty spread, preparing thoroughly for PayPal will cover a vast majority of what Intuit requires. The reverse is less true; focusing only on Intuit's list may leave gaps for PayPal, particularly in non-DP, sorting-adjacent problems.

In summary, build the common core, then branch based on the company-specific emphasis: DP for Intuit's optimization focus, and a broader set of sorting and medium-difficulty problems for PayPal's larger question bank.
