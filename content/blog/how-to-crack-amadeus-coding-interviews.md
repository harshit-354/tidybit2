Amadeus coding interviews test your ability to handle practical, data-centric problems. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like Codility or HackerRank, followed by discussions about your approach and code quality. The emphasis is less on obscure computer science theory and more on clean, efficient solutions to real-world scenarios you might encounter in travel technology.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: Amadeus interviews are heavily weighted towards fundamental problem-solving. With **67% Easy** and **33% Medium** questions, and **0% Hard**, the primary goal is to assess your coding fluency and reliability, not your ability to tackle the most complex algorithms. This breakdown means you must absolutely master the basics. A single bug in an easy array manipulation question or a suboptimal solution to a medium string problem can be more damaging than failing a hard dynamic programming question at other companies. Consistency, accuracy, and clean code are your primary objectives.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics directly reflect the data-processing nature of Amadeus's domain—managing flight bookings, passenger data, and reservation systems.

- **Array (26%):** The cornerstone. Expect manipulations, searching, and in-place modifications. Master two-pointer techniques and sliding windows.
- **Hash Table (22%):** Essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting. This is your go-to tool for optimizing solutions from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Simulation (19%):** A critical category for Amadeus. You'll be given a set of rules (e.g., processing a queue of bookings) and must model the process accurately in code. Focus on edge cases and state management.
- **String (15%):** Often involves parsing, validation, or transformation of text data, like itinerary codes or passenger names.
- **Sorting (11%):** Rarely the final answer but a crucial preprocessing step. Understand built-in sorts and when to use custom comparators.

The most important combined pattern is using a **Hash Table to track state or frequencies during an Array or String simulation**. This is ubiquitous.

```python
# Example: Find the first unique character in a string (simulation with hash table)
def first_unique_char(s: str) -> int:
    freq = {}
    # First pass: count frequencies (simulation of counting process)
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    # Second pass: find first char with freq == 1
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if freq[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: Find the first unique character in a string (simulation with hash table)
function firstUniqueChar(s) {
  const freq = new Map();
  // First pass: count frequencies
  for (const char of s) {
    freq.set(char, (freq.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Second pass: find first unique
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (freq.get(s[i]) === 1) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: Find the first unique character in a string (simulation with hash table)
public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    // First pass: count frequencies
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    // Second pass: find first unique
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (freq.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill Easy problems on the core topics: Array, Hash Table, String. Solve at least 30 problems. Prioritize 100% correctness over speed. Practice writing code by hand or in a simple text editor to mimic interview conditions.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration.** Move to Medium problems that combine topics, like "Array + Hash Table" or "String + Simulation." Solve 20-25 problems. Here, focus on developing a consistent process: clarify input/output, walk through examples, explain your brute-force approach, then optimize. Time your sessions.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement.** Use the last two weeks for timed practice sessions simulating a 60-minute interview (often 2 questions). Solve company-tagged problems on platforms. Critically review your own code: is it readable? Are variable names clear? Did you handle null/empty inputs? This is where you solidify the consistency Amadeus evaluates.

## Key Tips

1.  **Perfect the Easy Problems.** An optimal, bug-free solution to an Easy question is better than a messy, partially correct solution to a Medium. Allocate time to re-check your work on simple tasks.
2.  **Communicate Your Simulation Logic.** For simulation problems, verbally walk through the rules and your modeling approach before coding. Say, "I will simulate each booking step using a queue, and this hash map will track the current state of each resource." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Prioritize Readability.** Use descriptive variable names (`bookingQueue`, `passengerMap`) instead of generic ones (`q`, `map`). Write helper functions for clear logical blocks. Amadeus engineers need to maintain large codebases; they value readable code.
4.  **Explicitly Handle Edge Cases.** For travel data, empty lists, duplicate entries, and invalid inputs are common. State these edge cases aloud and include checks in your code. It shows production-level awareness.
5.  **Test with Your Own Examples.** Before declaring done, run your code against a simple normal case, a minimal edge case (empty input), and a more complex case. This often catches off-by-one errors missed during initial coding.

Focus on these fundamentals, practice with consistency in mind, and you'll be well-prepared for the practical challenges of an Amadeus coding interview.
