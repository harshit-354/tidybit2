When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Uber and JPMorgan Chase (JPMorgan) represent two distinct domains: high-growth tech and established finance. While both assess core algorithmic problem-solving skills, their interview landscapes differ significantly in volume, difficulty, and emphasis. This comparison breaks down these differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of documented questions is the most striking difference. On platforms like TidyBit, Uber has a catalog of **381 questions**, dwarfing JPMorgan's **78 questions**. This volume reflects Uber's status as a top-tier tech company with a highly competitive, leetcode-style interview process.

The difficulty distribution further highlights this contrast:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The interview is heavily weighted toward **Medium and Hard** problems. With 224 Medium and 103 Hard questions, you must be proficient in solving complex algorithmic challenges under time pressure. The high number of Hard questions indicates you will encounter problems requiring deep insight, optimization, and mastery of advanced patterns.
- **JPMorgan (E25/M45/H8):** The distribution is more balanced, leaning toward **Easy and Medium** difficulty. With only 8 Hard questions documented, the focus is more on assessing solid foundational knowledge, clean code, and logical reasoning rather than solving the most esoteric algorithms. The interview may involve practical problem-solving closer to real-world business logic.

This means preparing for Uber requires grinding a large volume of challenging problems, while JPMorgan prep can be more focused on mastering fundamentals and common patterns.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies frequently test several core data structures, as seen in their top topics.

**Shared High-Priority Topics:**

1.  **Array:** Fundamental to both. Expect manipulations, searching, and subarray problems.
2.  **String:** Common for parsing, matching, and transformation tasks.
3.  **Hash Table:** Essential for achieving O(1) lookups and solving frequency-counting problems.

The key difference lies in the depth and context. Uber's questions on these topics will often be woven into more complex scenarios or combined with other concepts like dynamic programming. JPMorgan's questions may apply these structures to more straightforward data processing tasks.

**Notable Divergence:**

- **Uber's Standout:** **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a top topic. This is a classic marker of a rigorous tech interview, requiring practice to recognize patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, or state transition.
- **JPMorgan's Addition:** **Sorting** is a listed top topic. While sorting is fundamental everywhere, its explicit mention suggests a possible emphasis on data organization, merging datasets, or preparing data for further processing—skills highly relevant in financial data contexts.

Here is a simple example of a frequency-counting problem (using Hash Tables) that could be asked at either company, though Uber might add a twist requiring optimization.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_majority_element(nums):
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
        if count[num] > len(nums) // 2:
            return num
    return None
```

```javascript
function findMajorityElement(nums) {
  const count = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    count.set(num, (count.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    if (count.get(num) > nums.length / 2) {
      return num;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

```java
public Integer findMajorityElement(int[] nums) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        count.put(num, count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        if (count.get(num) > nums.length / 2) {
            return num;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target and the transferability of skills.

**Prepare for JPMorgan First if:** You are new to technical interviews or your primary target is finance/quant roles. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) to an Easy/Medium level will build a strong foundation. The smaller question bank makes focused preparation feasible. These skills are 100% transferable and will serve as the essential base for tackling Uber-level problems later.

**Prepare for Uber First if:** Your goal is a top tech company (FAANG, etc.). The intense preparation required for Uber—drilling hundreds of Medium/Hard problems, especially in Dynamic Programming—will make JPMorgan's technical round feel comparatively less daunting. The skills are transferable _downwards_. If you can solve Uber's problems, you are almost certainly over-prepared for the technical depth of a JPMorgan interview, though you should still practice articulating your reasoning clearly for a finance context.

In summary, treat JPMorgan as a benchmark for **foundational competency** and Uber as the benchmark for **advanced algorithmic mastery**. A solid strategy is to build your core skills with JPMorgan's scope, then expand into the depth and breadth required for Uber.
