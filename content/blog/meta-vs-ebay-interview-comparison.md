When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and scope of each company's question bank is crucial for efficient study. Meta and eBay represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of interview preparation volume and, to some degree, difficulty distribution. Meta's list is vast and heavily weighted toward medium and hard problems, demanding deep algorithmic mastery. eBay's list is significantly more compact and focused, with a greater proportion of medium-difficulty questions. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is scale. Meta's list of **1387 questions** is massive, dwarfing eBay's **60 questions**. This volume reflects Meta's broader product scope and the intense competition for its engineering roles. The difficulty distribution further highlights the demanding nature of Meta's process:

- **Meta (E414/M762/H211):** Over 70% of its questions are categorized as Medium or Hard. Preparing for Meta means expecting complex problem-solving under pressure.
- **eBay (E12/M38/H10):** Here, nearly two-thirds of the questions are Medium difficulty. While Hard questions exist, the focus is more squarely on core concepts applied in challenging, but not overwhelmingly complex, scenarios.

This means preparing for Meta is a marathon of breadth and depth, while preparing for eBay is a targeted sprint on high-probability topics.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures, as seen in their top topics: **Array, String, and Hash Table**. This overlap is excellent news; mastering these areas serves as a strong common base.

- **Shared Core:** Proficiency in array manipulation, string algorithms (like sliding window or two pointers), and hash table usage for efficient lookups is non-negotiable for both.
- **Diverging Focus:** Meta's list includes **Math**, which often involves number theory, combinatorics, or bit manipulation problems. eBay's list highlights **Sorting**, indicating a practical focus on organizing and processing data efficiently. For eBay, ensure you know various sorting algorithms and their trade-offs, not just how to call a library sort.

```python
# Example of a shared core concept: Hash Table for Two-Sum
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# eBay-relevant focus: Implementing a basic sort (QuickSort)
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

```javascript
// Example of a shared core concept: Hash Table for Two-Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// eBay-relevant focus: Implementing a basic sort (QuickSort)
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
  const left = arr.filter((x) => x < pivot);
  const middle = arr.filter((x) => x === pivot);
  const right = arr.filter((x) => x > pivot);
  return [...quickSort(left), ...middle, ...quickSort(right)];
}
```

```java
// Example of a shared core concept: Hash Table for Two-Sum
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// eBay-relevant focus: Implementing a basic sort (QuickSort)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public List<Integer> quickSort(List<Integer> arr) {
    if (arr.size() <= 1) return arr;
    int pivot = arr.get(arr.size() / 2);
    List<Integer> left = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Integer> middle = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Integer> right = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int x : arr) {
        if (x < pivot) left.add(x);
        else if (x == pivot) middle.add(x);
        else right.add(x);
    }
    List<Integer> sorted = new ArrayList<>(quickSort(left));
    sorted.addAll(middle);
    sorted.addAll(quickSort(right));
    return sorted;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your strategy depends on your timeline and goals.

**Prepare for eBay first if:** You are new to technical interviews or have a shorter timeline. The confined question list allows for thorough, repeated practice. You can achieve high coverage and build confidence by mastering all 60 questions, focusing on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting. This provides a solid foundation of medium-difficulty problems.

**Prepare for Meta first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech companies or have a longer runway. Tackling Meta's list will force you to cover a wider range of problems and difficulty levels. The skills developed here will make eBay's list feel like a focused subset. However, this path requires months of consistent, dedicated practice.

A pragmatic hybrid approach is to **build a foundation using eBay's focused list, then expand into Meta's vast problem set.** This ensures you have core patterns down before tackling more esoteric and difficult problems. Regardless of the order, start with the shared core topics: drill array and string manipulations and internalize hash table patterns.
