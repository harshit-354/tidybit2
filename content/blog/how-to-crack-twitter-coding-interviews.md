Twitter’s coding interview process is designed to assess strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and system design under pressure. While the specific format can evolve, the core remains: solving medium-to-hard problems efficiently, communicating your thought process clearly, and writing clean, bug-free code. Success hinges on targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing a dataset of 53 recent Twitter-affiliated coding questions reveals a clear pattern:

- **Easy:** 8 questions (15%)
- **Medium:** 33 questions (62%)
- **Hard:** 12 questions (23%)

The 62% medium majority is your primary target. These problems test your ability to apply core algorithms to slightly novel scenarios. The 23% hard problems are significant; they often appear in later rounds and test mastery of complex patterns like advanced dynamic programming or intricate graph traversals. The low easy percentage indicates you won't be wasting time on trivial checks—the bar is set at medium from the start.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-frequency topics. Master these first.

**Array & Hash Table:** The most common combination. Problems often involve finding pairs, subarrays, or tracking frequencies. The essential pattern is using a hash map (dictionary) for O(1) lookups to achieve O(n) time complexity for problems that would otherwise be O(n²).

**String:** Manipulation and pattern matching are frequent. Key skills include two-pointer techniques for palindromes/reversals and understanding sliding windows for substring problems.

**Design:** This is a major differentiator. Be ready for both Object-Oriented Design (e.g., design a Tweet class, a social graph) and potentially System Design fundamentals (e.g., designing a timeline or trending topics service).

**Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or combinatorics. The problems are less about complex formulas and more about clever optimization using mathematical insight.

The most critical pattern to internalize is **Hash Table + Array/String traversal** for efficient lookups. Here’s a classic example: finding two numbers in an array that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example usage would return [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate each day to a top topic (Array/Hash Table, String, then Design principles). Solve 3-5 medium problems per topic, focusing on the pattern, not just the answer. For Design, practice outlining classes, relationships, and key methods.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Hard Problems.** Shift to mixed-topic problem sets. Start each session with a random medium problem to simulate the interview. Allocate 2-3 sessions per week to dissect hard problems—even if you don't code them fully, understanding the solution approach is valuable.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Drill.** Conduct at least 2-3 timed mock interviews per week, with a focus on verbalizing your reasoning. Use your performance data to identify weak spots (e.g., "I struggle with DFS backtracking") and do a concentrated deep dive on those sub-topics.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Narrate your thought process from the moment you see the problem. Ask clarifying questions, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and explain your code as you write it. Silence is your enemy.
2.  **Optimize with Intent.** Start with a brute-force solution to demonstrate understanding, then immediately state you'll look for optimizations. Propose using a hash table, two pointers, or a heap _before_ you write the code. This shows strategic thinking.
3.  **Practice Design Out Loud.** For design questions, talk through the entities, their core attributes, and how they interact. Use simple diagrams. Focus on the logical model and key operations before mentioning specific technologies.
4.  **Test Your Code.** Always run through a small example with your code, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). This catches off-by-one errors and shows thoroughness.
5.  **Clarify Ambiguity.** If a problem statement is vague, ask questions. "Can the input be empty?" "Are the numbers sorted?" "What should we return if no solution exists?" This is expected and shows attention to detail.

Targeted, consistent practice on the core patterns that dominate Twitter's question bank is the most reliable path to success. Understand the "why" behind every solution you study.
