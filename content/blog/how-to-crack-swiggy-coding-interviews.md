Swiggy’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or through a live coding session. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of the patterns and topics that Swiggy’s interviewers consistently favor.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 41 recent Swiggy coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 9 Easy (22%), 26 Medium (63%), and 6 Hard (15%). This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy.

The overwhelming majority (63%) of questions are at a Medium difficulty level. This indicates that Swiggy’s primary filter is your ability to reliably solve non-trivial problems that require combining 2-3 core concepts. You must be proficient in transforming a problem statement into an efficient algorithm, not just recalling syntax. The 15% Hard questions often serve as a differentiator for senior roles or particularly competitive positions, testing advanced optimization and handling complex edge cases. The takeaway is clear: **master Medium problems**. If you can confidently and consistently solve Medium-level questions on core topics, you will be well-prepared for the bulk of the interview.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward the most frequently tested areas. Here are the top five topics with their core patterns.

**Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving subarrays, rotations, and in-place manipulations. The two-pointer and sliding window techniques are paramount.
**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, and duplicate detection.
**Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator. Swiggy frequently asks DP questions, particularly those involving 1D and 2D states like the classic "knapsack" or "longest common subsequence" variants.
**String:** Often tested alongside arrays and hash tables. Focus on anagram checks, palindrome problems, and string transformations.
**Sorting:** While sometimes a standalone task, sorting is more often a crucial preprocessing step that enables other efficient algorithms like two-pointer solutions.

The most critical pattern to master is the **Sliding Window**, especially for Array and String problems. It’s the optimal solution for questions asking for the "longest substring," "maximum sum subarray of size k," or "substring with all characters." Here is a classic example: finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char is in map and its index is >= left, shrink window
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1
        # Update the character's latest index
        char_index[char] = right
        # Update maximum length
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    // If char exists and is within the current window
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    // Update the character's latest index
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    // Update maximum length
    max_len = Math.max(max_len, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        // If char exists and is within the current window
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        // Update the character's latest index
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        // Update maximum length
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a week-by-week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics (Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting, DP). For each, study the fundamental patterns (e.g., two-pointer, sliding window, frequency map, top-down/bottom-up DP). Solve 10-15 curated Medium problems per topic. Focus on understanding, not memorization.

**Week 3: Pattern Integration & Practice.** Move to problems that combine topics, like "Array + Hash Table" or "String + DP." This is where most Swiggy Medium questions live. Practice 3-4 problems daily, spending a strict 25-30 minutes on each to simulate interview pressure. Start analyzing time and space complexity aloud.

**Week 4: Mock Interviews & Weakness Targeting.** Conduct at least 3-5 full mock interviews (60-90 minutes each) with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the exact environment. Identify your weak spots—is it graph traversal, a specific DP pattern, or optimizing from O(n²) to O(n log n)? Dedicate the remaining days to drilling those areas.

**Week 5-6 (If Available): Company-Specific & Hard Problems.** In the final stretch, solve all available Swiggy-specific questions from sources like TidyBit. Attempt 1-2 Hard problems per week to stretch your thinking, but do not neglect Medium review. The goal is fluency and speed on their preferred problem types.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Never code in silence. Explain your thought process, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and articulate your complexity analysis before you write the first line of code. Interviewers assess your communication as much as your code.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness, Then Optimization.** Your first goal is a working, brute-force solution. State it clearly, then iterate. Saying, "This is O(n²); I can optimize it using a hash map to O(n)" shows structured thinking and is better than a silent, failed attempt at a complex one-pass solution.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through small, large, empty, and null inputs. Write these tests quickly in comments. It demonstrates professional habits and catches logical errors.
4.  **Write Clean, Modular Code.** Use descriptive variable names (`maxLength`, not `ml`). Extract logical blocks into helper functions if time permits. Messy, monolithic code is difficult to debug and review, even if it's functionally correct.

Mastering these patterns, following a disciplined study plan, and honing your interview execution will significantly increase your chances of success. The data shows the path—now you need to walk it.
