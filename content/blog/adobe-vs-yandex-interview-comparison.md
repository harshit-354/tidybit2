When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice. Adobe and Yandex, while both major tech firms, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. A strategic candidate analyzes these differences to allocate preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Adobe's question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With 227 cataloged questions, it offers nearly 70% more practice material than Yandex's 134. The difficulty distribution reveals a key strategic point:

- **Adobe (E68/M129/H30):** The majority of questions are Medium (129), with a substantial Hard tier (30). This indicates that Adobe's interviews frequently test complex problem-solving and optimization.
- **Yandex (E52/M72/H10):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Easy and Medium fundamentals (124 combined), with very few Hard questions (10). This suggests Yandex interviews prioritize correctness and clean implementation of core concepts over highly advanced algorithmic puzzles.

The volume means preparing for Adobe requires a longer, more rigorous timeline. Mastering Adobe's question set would naturally cover most of the difficulty spectrum needed for Yandex, but not necessarily the reverse.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a nearly identical core set of data structures and algorithms. The top four topics for each are:

1.  Array
2.  String
3.  Hash Table
4.  Two Pointers

This high overlap is excellent news for candidates. Proficiency in these areas is non-negotiable for both interview processes. You can expect problems involving manipulation, searching, and combining these structures. For example, a classic problem testing Array, Hash Table, and Two Pointers is finding two numbers that add up to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Two-pointer alternative (if array is sorted)
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Two-pointer alternative (if array is sorted)
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left, right];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Two-pointer alternative (if array is sorted)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[] {left, right};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

Given the identical topical focus, the main differentiator is not _what_ to study, but the _depth_ and _complexity_ at which you must master these topics.

## Which to Prepare for First

The logical preparation path is to **prioritize Yandex, then Adobe.**

Start with Yandex's question bank. Its emphasis on Easy and Medium problems from the core topics allows you to build a rock-solid foundation. Achieving fluency here ensures you can reliably solve the most common interview problems with clean code. This foundation is essential but may be insufficient for Adobe's harder problems.

Once comfortable, transition to Adobe's larger and more difficult set. This progression adds the necessary layer of advanced problem-solving and optimization skills. The process is efficient: mastering Adobe's questions will make you exceptionally well-prepared for Yandex's interviews, whereas preparing only for Yandex might leave gaps for Adobe's Hard problems.

In summary, use Yandex's list to build core competency and Adobe's list to reach advanced proficiency. The shared topical focus makes this a highly efficient study plan.
