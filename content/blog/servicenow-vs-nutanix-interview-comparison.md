When preparing for technical interviews at enterprise software companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both ServiceNow and Nutanix are major players, but their technical interview profiles show distinct differences in focus and difficulty. This comparison analyzes their question banks to help you prioritize and tailor your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

ServiceNow presents a larger overall volume of questions, with 78 cataloged compared to Nutanix's 68. This suggests a broader potential pool of problems, requiring more comprehensive preparation.

The difficulty distribution reveals a key strategic difference:

- **ServiceNow:** The breakdown is 78 questions: **Easy (8), Medium (58), Hard (12)**. The overwhelming emphasis is on **Medium-difficulty** problems, comprising nearly 75% of their question bank. This indicates that while you must master core concepts, the interviews are less likely to focus on extreme optimization puzzles and more on robust, correct solutions for standard algorithmic challenges.
- **Nutanix:** The breakdown is 68 questions: **Easy (5), Medium (46), Hard (17)**. While Medium problems are still the majority, Nutanix has a significantly higher proportion of **Hard** problems (25% vs. ServiceNow's 15%). This points to an interview process that may probe deeper into algorithmic optimization, edge cases, and complex problem-solving.

In short, ServiceNow tests for strong fundamentals and consistency, while Nutanix may include more "spike" questions designed to truly stretch your problem-solving abilities.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational data structures that form the backbone of most software engineering work.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are prominent for both. You must be exceptionally proficient in manipulating these structures, using two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and hash maps for efficient lookups.

```python
# Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: A classic Array/String problem (Sliding Window)
def max_subarray_length(nums, k):
    freq = {}
    left = max_len = 0
    for right, num in enumerate(nums):
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        while freq[num] > k:
            freq[nums[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: A classic Array/String problem (Sliding Window)
function maxSubarrayLength(nums, k) {
  const freq = new Map();
  let left = 0,
    maxLen = 0;
  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    freq.set(nums[right], (freq.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
    while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
      freq.set(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]) - 1);
      left++;
    }
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example: A classic Array/String problem (Sliding Window)
public int maxSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        freq.put(nums[right], freq.getOrDefault(nums[right], 0) + 1);
        while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
            freq.put(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]) - 1);
            left++;
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

**Key Differentiator:** The most notable divergence is **Depth-First Search (DFS)** appearing as a top topic for Nutanix, while **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a top topic for ServiceNow. This is a critical insight for focused study:

- **Prepare for Nutanix:** Deepen your understanding of **tree and graph traversal** (DFS, BFS), recursion, and backtracking.
- **Prepare for ServiceNow:** Ensure you are comfortable with core **Dynamic Programming** patterns, such as those for knapsack, longest common subsequence, or climbing stairs problems.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both, start with **ServiceNow**. Its heavier emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems across the most common data structures (Array, String, Hash Table) will solidify your core algorithmic fundamentals. Mastering these will build a strong foundation that is directly applicable to a large portion of the Nutanix question bank.

Once comfortable, pivot your focus to **Nutanix**. This requires layering on two additional competencies: 1) practicing more **Hard** problems to build stamina and optimization skills, and 2) drilling into **graph/tree algorithms (DFS)** to cover their unique emphasis. This progression from a broad medium-difficulty base to deeper, harder topics is an efficient study path.

Ultimately, your priority should be dictated by your interview schedule. However, the data clearly shows that ServiceNow's profile is more aligned with generalist software engineering interview prep, making it the logical starting point.
