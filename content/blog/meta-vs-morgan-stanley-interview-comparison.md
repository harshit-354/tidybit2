Preparing for technical interviews requires understanding the specific demands of each company. Meta and Morgan Stanley, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, have distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty, and focus areas. Meta's process is a high-volume, broad-based assessment of core data structures and problem-solving under pressure, typical of big tech. Morgan Stanley's process is more curated, with a sharper focus on applying fundamental algorithms to practical financial and systems-oriented problems, characteristic of elite finance and fintech.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The disparity in available practice questions is stark. Meta has a massive, publicly cataloged repository of 1387 questions, heavily weighted toward Medium (762) and Easy (414) difficulty, with a smaller set of Hard (211) problems. This reflects the standard big tech interview loop: 2-3 coding rounds that often start with a manageable problem and escalate in complexity, testing your ability to communicate and optimize under interview conditions.

Morgan Stanley's known set is far smaller, with 53 questions distributed as Easy (13), Medium (34), and Hard (6). The lower volume doesn't imply an easier interview; it indicates a more focused and potentially less leakable question bank. The difficulty distribution suggests you can expect at least one solid Medium-difficulty problem, requiring clean, correct code without unnecessary complexity.

**Example: A classic "Two Sum" question might be asked by both, but with different follow-ups.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Meta: Often a warm-up, but may lead to "3Sum" or handling sorted input.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Morgan Stanley: Might be framed in a financial context (e.g., finding two trades that net a target P&L).
def find_pair_for_target(prices, target_price):
    # Implementation identical in core logic
    map = {}
    for i, price in enumerate(prices):
        needed = target_price - price
        if needed in map:
            return [map[needed], i]
        map[price] = i
    return None
```

```javascript
// Meta
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Morgan Stanley
function findMatchingTrades(positions, targetPnL) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {
    const required = targetPnL - positions[i];
    if (seen.has(required)) {
      return [seen.get(required), i];
    }
    seen.set(positions[i], i);
  }
  return null;
}
```

```java
// Meta
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Morgan Stanley
public int[] findTradePair(int[] pnlStream, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> indexMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < pnlStream.length; i++) {
        int needed = target - pnlStream[i];
        if (indexMap.containsKey(needed)) {
            return new int[]{indexMap.get(needed), i};
        }
        indexMap.put(pnlStream[i], i);
    }
    return null;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These are the foundational tools for interview coding. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either process.

The key difference lies in the fourth top topic. Meta lists **Math**, which encompasses number theory, probability, and combinatorics problems common in their question bank. Morgan Stanley lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is a critical insight: Morgan Stanley interviews are more likely to include a problem requiring DP or memoization, such as classic optimization (knapsack, longest increasing subsequence) or pathfinding. This aligns with quantitative and risk-assessment thinking.

**Example: A Dynamic Programming problem is more likely at Morgan Stanley.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# A classic DP problem like "Coin Change"
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Meta first**. Its enormous question bank covers the fundamental algorithmic patterns (DFS/BFS, sliding window, two pointers, etc.) and data structure implementations that form the core of modern technical interviewing. Successfully practicing for Meta will build the speed, pattern recognition, and communication skills needed for any coding interview, including Morgan Stanley's.

Once Meta's core patterns are solid, pivot to Morgan Stanley-specific preparation. This involves two key shifts: 1) **Deepen Dynamic Programming** skills, ensuring you can derive and code tabulation or memoization solutions. 2) **Practice contextualizing** solutions—think about how array or string problems could model financial data, sequences, or system states. The smaller question bank means you should solve each known problem thoroughly and understand its underlying principle, as variations are likely.

In short, use Meta's breadth to build your generalist engine, then apply Morgan Stanley's focus to tune it for a finance-tech environment.
