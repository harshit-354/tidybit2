Gojek’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong foundational problem-solving and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including an initial online assessment and subsequent technical interviews where you’ll solve algorithmic problems on a shared editor. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of the patterns and data structures they most frequently test.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Gojek’s recent coding problems reveals a clear focus: **80% Medium** and **20% Hard** difficulty, with no Easy questions. This distribution signals that Gojek prioritizes candidates who can reliably solve complex, multi-step problems. You must be comfortable with Medium-level questions as your baseline; these are the gatekeepers. The 20% Hard questions are the differentiators, often testing advanced applications of core data structures or clever optimizations. Your preparation should aim for high fluency in Medium problems, with dedicated practice on Hard problems to compete for top-tier performance.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a cohesive set for solving real-world, system-adjacent problems like routing, mapping, and hierarchical data processing.

- **Array:** Master in-place manipulations, sliding window, and prefix sum techniques. These are fundamental for efficient data processing.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for frequency counting, memoization, and solving Two Sum variants.
- **Tree & Binary Tree:** Understand traversals (recursive and iterative), path sums, and subtree validation. These model hierarchical data.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Critical for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversal in trees. Often paired with Tree problems.

The most critical pattern to master is **BFS on a Binary Tree for level-order traversal**. This is foundational for problems involving tree levels, zigzag traversal, or finding the minimum depth.

```python
from collections import deque

def levelOrder(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(current_level)
    return result
```

```javascript
function levelOrder(root) {
  if (!root) return [];
  const result = [];
  const queue = [root];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    const currentLevel = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      currentLevel.push(node.val);
      if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
      if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
    }
    result.push(currentLevel);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null) return result;

    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int levelSize = queue.size();
        List<Integer> currentLevel = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode node = queue.poll();
            currentLevel.add(node.val);
            if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
            if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
        }
        result.add(currentLevel);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: **Foundation.** Deeply study the core data structures: Arrays, Hash Tables, Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs), and Graphs. Implement basic operations and standard traversals from scratch. Solve 15-20 fundamental Medium problems on these topics.
Weeks 3-4: **Pattern Mastery.** Focus on high-frequency algorithmic patterns: BFS/DFS, sliding window, two pointers, and recursion/backtracking. Solve 25-30 Medium problems, prioritizing those tagged with Gojek's top topics. Begin timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem).
Weeks 5-6: **Integration and Intensity.** Tackle 5-10 Hard problems, particularly those combining Trees and BFS or Arrays and Hash Tables. Conduct several 2-hour mock interviews simulating the full interview process. Revisit and re-solve previously challenging problems to ensure retention.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Always restate the problem in your own words, discuss edge cases, and outline your approach (including time/space complexity) before writing a single line of code. Interviewers evaluate your thought process as much as your solution.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** Start with a brute-force solution if the optimal one isn't immediately clear. Then, identify bottlenecks and systematically improve them. This demonstrates structured problem-solving.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use clear variable names, avoid overly clever one-liners, include comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (null inputs, empty trees, single-element arrays) explicitly. This shows you write maintainable code.
4.  **Practice on a Shared Editor.** Use platforms that offer collaborative coding sessions. Get comfortable with no syntax highlighting or auto-complete, as this mirrors the interview environment.

Mastering these patterns and practicing with discipline will position you strongly for Gojek's technical challenges. For a targeted list of problems, [Browse all Gojek questions on TidyBit](/company/gojek).
