Wish’s technical interview process is designed to assess a candidate’s ability to handle real-world, scalable e-commerce problems. The process typically involves an initial recruiter screen, one or two technical phone screens focusing on data structures and algorithms, and a final virtual onsite with multiple rounds. These rounds often include system design and behavioral questions alongside the core coding challenges. The problems are practical, frequently modeling scenarios like inventory management, order processing, or recommendation systems. Success hinges on clean, efficient code and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Wish’s coding question distribution is revealing: 0% Easy, 80% Medium, and 20% Hard. This breakdown tells a clear story.

The complete absence of Easy questions signals that Wish expects a strong foundational proficiency from the outset. You won’t be warmed up with simple array traversals. The 80% concentration on Medium problems is the core of the interview. These questions test your ability to apply standard algorithms to moderately complex scenarios, often with constraints that require careful thought about edge cases and optimization. The 20% Hard questions are the differentiator. They are typically multi-step problems that combine several concepts or require an advanced data structure to achieve an optimal solution. This mix indicates that while you must be rock-solid on fundamentals, you also need the stamina and skill to tackle at least one highly challenging problem under pressure.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a blueprint for your preparation. Focus your energy here.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, and prefix sums to model continuous events or transactions.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Critical for problems requiring constant-time access to the "top" or "most extreme" element, such as merging K sorted lists, finding the top K items, or managing a stream of orders by priority.
- **Simulation:** A direct reflection of Wish’s domain. These problems ask you to model a process step-by-step, like order fulfillment or inventory tracking, requiring meticulous attention to state management and edge cases.
- **Ordered Set (or TreeMap/SortedSet):** Used when you need to maintain a dynamic collection of items in sorted order with efficient insertions, deletions, and lookups for ranges or nearest values—common in leaderboard or price feed scenarios.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to for O(1) lookups. Essential for caching, frequency counting, and mapping relationships, often used in combination with other structures.

The most important pattern to master is the **Heap-based "Top K"** pattern, as it combines Array, Heap, and sometimes Hash Table concepts. Here’s how to implement finding the K most frequent elements in multiple languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def topKFrequent(nums, k):
    # 1. Count frequencies
    count = Counter(nums)
    # 2. Use a min-heap of size k
    heap = []
    for num, freq in count.items():
        heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, num))
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap) # Remove the least frequent
    # 3. Extract elements from heap
    return [num for freq, num in heap]
```

```javascript
function topKFrequent(nums, k) {
  // 1. Count frequencies
  const freqMap = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // 2. Use a min-heap (simulated via array sort)
  const minHeap = [];
  for (const [num, freq] of freqMap) {
    minHeap.push([freq, num]);
    minHeap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // Sort ascending
    if (minHeap.length > k) {
      minHeap.shift(); // Remove the least frequent
    }
  }
  // 3. Extract elements
  return minHeap.map((item) => item[1]);
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        // 1. Count frequencies
        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            count.put(num, count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        // 2. Use a min-heap of size k
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> heap =
            new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.getValue() - b.getValue());
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : count.entrySet()) {
            heap.offer(entry);
            if (heap.size() > k) {
                heap.poll(); // Remove the least frequent
            }
        }
        // 3. Extract elements from heap
        int[] result = new int[k];
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[i] = heap.poll().getKey();
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Heap, etc.), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Understand the underlying patterns, not just individual solutions. Implement every solution in your primary language.
- **Week 3: Pattern Integration & Simulation.** Shift to problems that combine multiple topics, especially Simulation-type questions. Practice writing clean, bug-free code that models processes. Start timing your sessions (45-50 minutes per problem) to mimic the interview pace.
- **Week 4: Hard Problems & Mock Interviews.** Allocate 60-75 minutes to solve 1-2 Hard problems daily. Focus on breaking them down into manageable sub-problems. In the final 3-4 days, conduct at least 3 full mock interviews with a peer or using a platform, including verbal explanation.
- **Week 5-6 (If Needed): Targeted Review & Company-Specific Practice.** Revisit problem categories where you feel weak. Solve every Wish-tagged problem you can find. This will acclimate you to their problem style and common themes.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a line of code, explain your approach. Verbalize your thought process as you code, and discuss trade-offs. Interviewers assess your collaborative problem-solving ability.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First, Then Optimization.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one that’s buggy. Get a working solution, then analyze its complexity and propose improvements. Use this as a natural way to showcase your optimization skills.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** After coding, immediately walk through edge cases: empty input, single element, large K values, duplicate elements, and negative numbers. State these out loud and trace your logic. This demonstrates professional thoroughness.
4.  **Practice with Heaps and Ordered Sets.** These are less common in everyday coding but are high-yield for Wish. Ensure you can implement and use them without hesitation, understanding when they are the optimal tool.

Mastering these patterns and executing a disciplined study plan will position you strongly for Wish’s technical interviews. The focus is on practical, scalable solutions—so think like an engineer building for millions of users.
