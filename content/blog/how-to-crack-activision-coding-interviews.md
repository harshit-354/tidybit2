## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Activision’s coding interviews are designed to assess practical problem-solving skills. The data shows a clear pattern: expect one easy question and two medium questions. This 33%/67% split means you must be proficient at solving medium-difficulty problems under time pressure. Hard problems are rare, so your preparation should prioritize breadth and speed over tackling extreme algorithmic complexity. The focus is on your ability to write clean, correct code for common patterns, not on obscure optimization.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**String Manipulation:** Expect questions involving parsing, validation, or transformation. Master two-pointer techniques and efficient iteration.

**Stack:** Essential for problems involving nested structures, matching pairs, or evaluating sequences. The classic pattern is using a stack to track open elements.

**Recursion:** Frequently appears in tree/graph traversal, backtracking, and divide-and-conquer. Understand base cases and state management.

The most critical pattern for Activision is the **Stack for Parentheses Validation**, a common medium-difficulty string problem. Here’s the implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_valid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:  # Closing bracket
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:  # Opening bracket
            stack.append(char)

    return not stack
```

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const mapping = { ")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "[" };

  for (let char of s) {
    if (mapping[char]) {
      // Closing bracket
      const top = stack.length ? stack.pop() : "#";
      if (mapping[char] !== top) return false;
    } else {
      // Opening bracket
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Character, Character> mapping = Map.of(')', '(', '}', '{', ']', '[');

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (mapping.containsKey(c)) { // Closing bracket
            char top = stack.isEmpty() ? '#' : stack.pop();
            if (mapping.get(c) != top) return false;
        } else { // Opening bracket
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Focus on the top three topics. Solve 15-20 problems on strings, stacks, and recursion. Ensure you can implement core patterns like two-pointers, stack-based evaluation, and recursive backtracking from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Medium Problem Mastery.** Solve 30-40 medium problems, prioritizing those tagged with Activision or similar gaming companies. Time yourself. Practice explaining your reasoning aloud as you code.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Review.** Complete 8-10 timed mock interviews simulating the one-easy, two-medium format. Revisit all incorrect problems. Focus on writing bug-free code on the first attempt.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A working, readable solution is better than an optimal but buggy one. Activision values maintainable code.
2.  **Communicate Your Process.** Verbally outline your approach before coding. Discuss trade-offs if you see multiple solutions.
3.  **Test Your Code.** After writing, walk through a small test case. Check edge cases like empty strings, single characters, or deeply nested input.
4.  **Manage Your Time.** Allocate ~10 minutes for the easy problem, ~20 minutes each for the mediums. If stuck, state your next logical step rather than staying silent.
