Preparing for technical interviews requires understanding each company's specific focus areas. Goldman Sachs and Salesforce both emphasize core data structures and algorithms, but their question distributions and difficulty profiles reveal distinct priorities that should inform your study strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Goldman Sachs presents a larger overall question pool (270 vs 189), indicating a broader range of potential problems. Its difficulty distribution is 51 Easy, 171 Medium, and 48 Hard questions. This shows a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which form the vast majority (63%) of their catalog. The interview process often tests foundational understanding under time pressure, with a significant portion of problems being complex applications of standard patterns.

Salesforce's catalog is smaller but has a more balanced difficulty curve relative to its size: 27 Easy, 113 Medium, and 49 Hard questions. While Medium problems still dominate (60%), the proportion of **Hard questions is notably higher** (26% of Salesforce's total vs 18% of Goldman's). This suggests Salesforce interviews may dive deeper into optimization and edge cases, even for foundational topics.

```python
# Example Medium problem pattern common to both: Two Sum variation
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Goldman Sachs might layer in financial data constraints.
# Salesforce might extend it to a system design discussion.
```

```javascript
// Example Medium problem pattern common to both: Two Sum variation
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example Medium problem pattern common to both: Two Sum variation
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This core overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both interviews.

- **Arrays & Strings:** Expect manipulations, searching, sorting, and sliding window problems.
- **Hash Tables:** Used for frequency counting, memoization, and lookups to optimize solutions from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical topic for both. Goldman Sachs may apply DP to financial modeling scenarios (e.g., maximizing profit, minimizing risk), while Salesforce might frame DP around data processing or system optimization tasks.

The key difference lies in context, not core topics. Goldman Sachs problems may implicitly assume financial contexts like time-series data or portfolio optimization. Salesforce problems often relate to data objects, user systems, or scalable data processing, reflecting its CRM and SaaS focus.

```python
# DP Example: A classic problem likely at both.
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Context: For Goldman, 'coins' could be trade denominations.
# For Salesforce, it could be API call cost optimization.
```

```javascript
// DP Example: A classic problem likely at both.
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// DP Example: A classic problem likely at both.
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Goldman Sachs first**. Its larger question volume and strong Medium-difficulty focus make it an excellent benchmark for core algorithmic proficiency. Mastering the 171 Medium problems builds the speed and pattern recognition needed for any technical interview. The skills transfer directly to Salesforce's catalog.

After solidifying your foundation with Goldman-style problems, transition to Salesforce preparation. Focus on tackling a higher density of Hard problems to practice deep optimization and complex edge-case handling. Use the shared topic focus (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) as your anchor, but shift your mental framing to consider data scalability and system efficiency.

This sequential approach—breadth and speed with Goldman, then depth and optimization with Salesforce—efficiently builds the comprehensive skill set required to succeed in both interview processes.
