Cracking the Cars24 coding interview requires targeted preparation. Their process typically involves multiple rounds focusing on problem-solving, system design, and domain knowledge, with a strong emphasis on practical coding ability. The questions are designed to assess how you approach real-world engineering problems, not just textbook algorithms. Let's break down what you need to know.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our data shows a clear pattern: Cars24's coding questions are almost exclusively **Medium** difficulty. With 7 out of 7 questions falling into this category, the signal is unambiguous. You will not be wasting time on trivial array manipulations, nor are you likely to face esoteric, competition-level graph problems.

This 100% Medium focus means the interview is a test of **consistent, reliable problem-solving under pressure**. They are evaluating your ability to cleanly implement well-known patterns with optimal or near-optimal efficiency. The challenge lies in recognizing the correct pattern, handling edge cases, and writing bug-free code within the interview timeframe. Mastery of core data structures and common algorithms is non-negotiable.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data reveals five critical areas. Prioritize these in your study.

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving in-place transformations, subarray calculations, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Hash Table:** The essential tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Crucial for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, and caching state.
- **String:** Often combined with Hash Table (for anagrams) or Array techniques (for two-pointer or sliding window problems).
- **Binary Search:** Not just for searching sorted arrays. Master its application in "search space" problems, like finding the minimum or maximum of a feasible answer.
- **Design:** This is a significant differentiator. Be prepared for object-oriented design questions (like a parking lot or vehicle rental system) that test your modeling skills and knowledge of design principles.

The most frequent pattern combining Array, Hash Table, and String is the **Sliding Window**. It's perfect for problems dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings with certain constraints.

```python
def longest_substring_without_repeating(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}  # Hash Table: character -> its latest index
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char is in window, shrink window from left
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1
        # Update char's latest index
        char_index[char] = right
        # Update max length
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringWithoutRepeating(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map(); // Hash Table
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const char = s[right];
    // If char is in window, shrink window from left
    if (charIndex.has(char) && charIndex.get(char) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(char) + 1;
    }
    // Update char's latest index
    charIndex.set(char, right);
    // Update max length
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringWithoutRepeating(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>(); // Hash Table
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        // If char is in window, shrink window from left
        if (charIndex.containsKey(c) && charIndex.get(c) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(c) + 1;
        }
        // Update char's latest index
        charIndex.put(c, right);
        // Update max length
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Follow this structured plan to build and solidify the required skills.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Foundation**

- Deeply study the top five topics: Array, Hash Table, String, Binary Search, and fundamental Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
- For each topic, learn 2-3 key patterns (e.g., for Array: Two-Pointer, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum). Solve 5-7 Medium problems per pattern.
- Begin practicing object-oriented design basics. Sketch UML diagrams for simple systems.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Practice**

- Start solving mixed-topic Medium problems. The goal is pattern recognition.
- Dedicate significant time to **Binary Search** variations (e.g., find peak element, minimum in rotated array) and **Design** problems. Practice explaining your design choices aloud.
- Implement every solution you write. Do not just think through the algorithm.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Simulate the real interview. Use a timer (45-60 minutes) and a whiteboard/online editor to solve 2 Medium problems back-to-back.
- Focus on communicating your thought process clearly before coding.
- Revisit weak areas and solve company-tagged problems.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate, Then Code:** Always explain your approach, time/space complexity, and consider edge cases _before_ writing a single line of code. Interviewers assess your process.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally:** It's acceptable to start with a brute-force solution if you immediately identify its inefficiency and articulate a plan to optimize it (e.g., "This is O(n²); I can improve it to O(n) using a hash map to store seen elements.").
3.  **Practice Design Methodically:** For design questions, clarify requirements first, identify core entities (Noun Extraction), define their relationships, and then outline key methods with signatures. Discuss trade-offs.
4.  **Write Clean Code:** Use meaningful variable names, write helper functions for clarity, and comment on complex logic. Sloppy code costs points even if the algorithm is correct.
5.  **Test Your Own Code:** After writing, walk through a small test case, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Verbally correct any bugs you find.

Success at Cars24 is about demonstrating consistent, structured, and practical software engineering skill. Focus on Medium problems, master the core patterns, and practice articulating your solutions.
