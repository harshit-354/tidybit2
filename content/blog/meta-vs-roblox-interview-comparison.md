When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and scope of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Meta and Roblox represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of scale and interview philosophy. Meta, a social media and advertising giant, has a vast, well-documented repository of questions reflecting its large-scale, complex systems. Roblox, a user-generated gaming platform, has a significantly smaller but highly relevant set of questions focused on its core engineering challenges. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of questions. Meta's list of **1,387 questions** is massive, dwarfing Roblox's **56 questions**. This volume reflects Meta's longer history of public interview data, its size, and the breadth of its engineering domains.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Meta (E414/M762/H211):** The distribution is balanced towards Medium difficulty, which is typical for large tech companies. The high number of Easy questions often serves as foundational practice, while the substantial Hard category tests deep algorithmic knowledge and optimization under pressure.
- **Roblox (E8/M36/H12):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty problems, which comprise nearly two-thirds of their list. This suggests Roblox interviews prioritize strong, reliable problem-solving on common patterns over solving extremely esoteric or complex algorithm puzzles.

In practice, preparing for Meta requires a broad, endurance-based approach, while preparing for Roblox allows for deep, focused mastery of a smaller set of concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures. The top four topics are identical, just in a slightly different order:

- **Meta:** Array, String, Hash Table, Math
- **Roblox:** Array, Hash Table, String, Math

This overlap means core preparation in these areas serves you for both. The emphasis on **Array** and **Hash Table** problems is universal for testing basic data manipulation and efficient lookups. A question like "Two Sum" is a classic example you must know.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

However, the context differs. Meta's vast question pool will apply these structures to a wider variety of scenarios, including system design concepts. Roblox's questions, while using the same structures, may be more directly applicable to scenarios involving game state, player data, or real-time interactions.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your strategy should be dictated by your goals and timeline.

**Prepare for Roblox first if:** You are interviewing with them specifically or are early in your interview practice cycle. Mastering their focused list of ~56 questions, especially the Medium ones, is an achievable, high-return goal. You can achieve reasonable coverage and confidence in a shorter timeframe.

**Prepare for Meta first if:** You are aiming for FAANG-level companies generally or have a longer preparation timeline. Tackling Meta's list will force you to develop stamina and see a huge variety of problem patterns. Successfully preparing for Meta's breadth inherently covers the core topics needed for Roblox and most other companies. It's the more comprehensive, transferable foundation.

A hybrid approach is effective: use the core topics (Array, Hash Table, String) as your daily drill. Then, layer on company-specific lists closer to your interview dates. For Roblox, deep-dive into their curated problems. For Meta, ensure you can consistently solve Medium problems within time limits and can articulate solutions for a sampling of Hard problems.
