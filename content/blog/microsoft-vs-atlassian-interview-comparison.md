When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns matter. Microsoft and Atlassian represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of scale and focus. Microsoft, a tech giant with a vast product suite, has a massive, well-documented interview question bank. Atlassian, while a major player in developer tools, has a significantly smaller and more concentrated set of known problems. Understanding the differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The disparity in question volume is the most striking difference. Microsoft's repository of **1,352 questions** dwarfs Atlassian's **62**. This reflects both the companies' sizes and the longer history of Microsoft interview data being collected and shared online.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty, with a substantial number of Easy and a significant pool of Hard problems. This suggests a balanced but demanding interview process that tests fundamentals and advanced problem-solving.
- **Atlassian (E7/M43/H12):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions. With very few Easy and Hard problems, Atlassian's known interviews concentrate on core algorithmic competency and clean implementation, rather than trivial tasks or extreme optimization challenges.

This means preparing for Microsoft requires grinding a larger set of problems across the difficulty spectrum, while Atlassian prep can be more focused on mastering medium-level concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Hash Table**

This strong overlap is good news. Mastering these core areas will serve you well for interviews at either company. The patterns for solving problems with hash maps for lookups, or two-pointers on arrays and strings, are universally applicable.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer technique on an array (common to both)
def reverse_string(s: list[str]) -> None:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer technique on an array (common to both)
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    [s[left], s[right]] = [s[right], s[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer technique on an array (common to both)
public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

</div>

A key difference is the fourth most frequent topic. For Microsoft, it's **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, indicating a strong emphasis on optimization and recursive problem-solving. For Atlassian, it's **Sorting**, which points to a focus on data manipulation, efficiency in core operations, and often precedes other algorithms like two-pointer or binary search.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be dictated by your goals and timeline.

**Prepare for Atlassian first if:** You are interviewing with them specifically, or you want to build a strong foundation efficiently. The smaller, medium-focused question set allows you to deeply master the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) without being overwhelmed. Success here builds confidence and a solid base that is directly transferable.

**Prepare for Microsoft first if:** You are targeting Microsoft, or you have more time and want to undertake comprehensive preparation that will cover almost any other interview. Tackling Microsoft's vast problem set, including its Dynamic Programming questions, will force you to encounter a wider variety of patterns and difficulty levels. The skills developed will easily encompass the scope required for Atlassian.

In practice, a hybrid approach is effective: use the concentrated Atlassian list to solidify fundamentals, then expand into the broader Microsoft set to stress-test and broaden your abilities, paying special attention to Dynamic Programming.
