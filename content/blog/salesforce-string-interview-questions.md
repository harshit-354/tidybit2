String manipulation is a core skill tested in Salesforce technical interviews. With 47 out of 189 cataloged questions focused on strings, this domain represents nearly 25% of their problem pool. This emphasis exists because handling text data—parsing, validating, transforming, and matching—is fundamental to working with Salesforce’s platform, APIs, and data models. Whether you're processing SOQL queries, managing record identifiers, or cleaning customer data, efficient string algorithms are a daily necessity.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Salesforce string questions typically fall into a few key categories. You should be ready for:

- **Basic Manipulation & Parsing:** Tasks like reversing strings, checking palindromes, or extracting substrings. These often test attention to detail and edge-case handling.
- **Pattern Matching & Searching:** Implementing or using algorithms to find substrings (e.g., `strStr()` problems) or validate patterns against rules or regular expressions.
- **Encoding, Compression, and Transformation:** Problems that involve run-length encoding, string compression, or applying specific transformation rules.
- **Validation and Sanitization:** Checking if strings represent valid emails, serial numbers, or other formats according to business logic.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Some problems delve into dynamic programming (e.g., edit distance, longest common subsequence) or sliding window techniques for more complex scenarios.

The difficulty often lies not in the core algorithm but in the constraints and the need for clean, efficient code that handles null inputs, empty strings, and large datasets gracefully.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on mastering fundamental patterns rather than memorizing solutions. Practice writing bug-free code for these core operations: iteration, slicing, and using hash maps or sets for tracking characters. Always clarify input assumptions and walk through edge cases verbally.

A critical pattern is the **Two-Pointer Technique**, frequently used for in-place string manipulation (like reversing) or checking palindromes without extra space.

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric characters
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left, right = left + 1, right - 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Skip non-alphanumeric characters
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) {
      left++;
    }
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) {
      right--;
    }
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Skip non-alphanumeric characters
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
            right--;
        }
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Start with foundational problems to build confidence, then progress to more complex patterns.

1.  **Basics:** String reversal, palindrome checks, and anagram detection.
2.  **Parsing:** Valid parentheses, string-to-integer conversion (`atoi`), and basic tokenization.
3.  **Sliding Window:** Longest substring without repeating characters, permutation in string.
4.  **Dynamic Programming:** Edit distance, longest common subsequence.
5.  **Salesforce-Specific:** Tackle problems tagged with Salesforce on platforms like TidyBit to understand their style.

Consistent, timed practice is key. Always analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.
