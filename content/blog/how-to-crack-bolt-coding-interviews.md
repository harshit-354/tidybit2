Bolt’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills under pressure. Candidates typically face a series of coding rounds focusing on algorithmic efficiency and clean code, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a collaborative editor. The questions are known for being applied and data-centric, reflecting the real-world engineering challenges at a fast-paced mobility and fintech company. Success hinges not just on finding a solution, but on optimizing it and communicating your thought process clearly.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, a typical Bolt coding interview slate consists of approximately 6 questions. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards foundational problem-solving:

- **Easy: 3 questions (50%).** These are your gatekeepers. They test core competency in data structure manipulation and basic logic. Failing to cleanly solve these is often an immediate rejection. Expect tasks involving string parsing, array transformations, or straightforward hash table use.
- **Medium: 2 questions (33%).** This is where the interview is usually won or lost. These problems require combining concepts, such as using a hash map to optimize a sliding window on a string or applying a fundamental dynamic programming pattern. You must demonstrate both correctness and efficiency (typically O(n) or O(n log n)).
- **Hard: 1 question (17%).** Not every candidate will see a truly "Hard" problem, but if you do, it's an opportunity to shine. It often involves a complex application of a core topic like Dynamic Programming or an intricate graph traversal. Partial credit for a well-explained, sub-optimal approach can still leave a strong impression.

The takeaway is clear: **Mastery of Easy and Medium problems is non-negotiable.** Your preparation should ensure you can solve these quickly and reliably, leaving mental bandwidth to tackle harder challenges.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics align with processing the kind of transactional, user, and geo-data Bolt handles daily.

1.  **Hash Table:** The single most important tool. It’s used for O(1) lookups to cache results, count frequencies, or map relationships. The "frequency counter" pattern is ubiquitous.
2.  **String:** Questions often involve validation, parsing, or searching within text (e.g., user inputs, addresses). Common patterns include sliding windows for substrings and two-pointer manipulation.
3.  **Array:** Fundamental for any data list manipulation. Focus on in-place operations, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sum arrays.
4.  **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A key differentiator for Medium/Hard problems. You must recognize when a problem has overlapping subproblems. Start with classic patterns like "0/1 Knapsack" or "Longest Common Subsequence."
5.  **Counting:** Closely tied to Hash Tables. Many problems boil down to efficiently counting character frequencies, element occurrences, or subarray sums meeting a criteria.

The quintessential Bolt problem often combines a Hash Table with String or Array traversal. The most critical pattern to internalize is the **Hash Map for a Sliding Window**, used to find substrings or subarrays with specific properties.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill Easy problems on Hash Tables, Strings, and Arrays. Implement all basic data structures from scratch once. Solve at least 20-30 Easy problems until you can code them flawlessly in under 15 minutes.
- **Weeks 3-4: Core Patterns.** Tackle Medium problems. Focus on one pattern per day: Sliding Window (with Hash Map), Two Pointers, Prefix Sum, and fundamental DP (Fibonacci, 0/1 Knapsack). Solve 2-3 variations of each pattern.
- **Week 5: Integration and Bolt-Specific Practice.** Mix Easy and Medium problems randomly to simulate an interview. Use the TidyBit Bolt question list to practice actual and similar problems. Time yourself strictly.
- **Week 6: Mock Interviews & Review.** Conduct at least 3-4 mock interviews with a peer or mentor. Revisit your most common mistake areas. Focus on clearly articulating your approach before coding.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First with a Hash Map.** When you hear a problem involving arrays or strings, your first thought should be: "Can a hash map store counts or indices to make this O(n)?" This is the most common optimization path in Bolt interviews.
2.  **Clarify Edge Cases Immediately.** Bolt's problems often involve real data. Ask about input size, character sets (alphanumeric?), empty inputs, and negative numbers before you start coding. Stating these shows systematic thinking.
3.  **Start with a Brute-Force, Then Optimize.** Don't jump straight to the optimal solution unless it's trivial. Clearly state the naive O(n²) approach, then explain how you can improve it (e.g., "We can eliminate the inner loop by caching results in a hash map").
4.  **Practice Verbalizing Your Logic.** Your interviewer is evaluating your communication. Narrate your thought process as you write pseudo-code or code. Say "I'm using a left and right pointer to represent the window" rather than just silently writing the loop.
5.  **Test with Your Own Examples.** After writing code, don't just say "it looks right." Walk through a small, non-trivial test case step-by-step with your code, including edge cases. This catches bugs and demonstrates thoroughness.

Mastering these patterns and strategies will transform Bolt's coding interview from a daunting challenge into a structured problem-solving session you are prepared to ace.
