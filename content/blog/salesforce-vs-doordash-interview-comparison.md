When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Salesforce and DoorDash, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you prioritize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of reported questions is the most immediate difference. With **189 questions** cataloged, Salesforce's question bank is significantly larger than DoorDash's **87 questions**. This suggests a broader pool of potential problems at Salesforce, making pattern recognition slightly more challenging.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring bars:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The curve is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty, which constitutes about 60% of their questions. This indicates a strong focus on core problem-solving with a moderate level of complexity. The presence of Hard questions is notable but less frequent.
- **DoorDash (E6/M51/H30):** The distribution skews even more toward Medium and Hard problems. **Medium** questions make up nearly 59% of their set, but **Hard** questions represent about 34%—a substantially higher proportion than at Salesforce. This points to a greater expectation for candidates to handle complex, multi-layered algorithmic challenges, often involving system design aspects within the problem.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are critical for interviews at either. This common core should be mastered first.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Salesforce** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with their emphasis on medium-difficulty problems that test optimized recursion and state management, common in classic DP scenarios like knapsack, subsequence, or pathfinding problems.
- **DoorDash** frequently tests **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, often in the context of **tree and graph traversal**. This is highly relevant for a logistics company, where problems often involve navigating networks, paths, or hierarchical structures (e.g., menu systems, delivery routes, dependency resolutions).

This difference in advanced topics dictates your deep-dive preparation. For Salesforce, you must drill into DP patterns. For DoorDash, you need to be exceptionally comfortable with recursive traversal, backtracking, and graph algorithms.

**Example: A "Path Sum" problem could be asked by both, but the follow-up might differ.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python - DFS approach (relevant for DoorDash's emphasis)
def has_path_sum(root, target_sum):
    if not root:
        return False
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return target_sum == root.val
    new_target = target_sum - root.val
    return (has_path_sum(root.left, new_target) or
            has_path_sum(root.right, new_target))
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - DFS approach
function hasPathSum(root, targetSum) {
  if (!root) return false;
  if (!root.left && !root.right) return targetSum === root.val;
  const newTarget = targetSum - root.val;
  return hasPathSum(root.left, newTarget) || hasPathSum(root.right, newTarget);
}
```

```java
// Java - DFS approach
public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
    if (root == null) return false;
    if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return targetSum == root.val;
    int newTarget = targetSum - root.val;
    return hasPathSum(root.left, newTarget) || hasPathSum(root.right, newTarget);
}
```

</div>

A Salesforce follow-up might extend this into a DP problem: "Find the number of paths that sum to a target," requiring a prefix-sum hash map approach.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your timeline and strengths.

Prepare for **Salesforce first** if you are building foundational mastery. The larger question bank with a strong medium-difficulty core is excellent for general practice. Mastering their focus areas, especially Dynamic Programming, will solidify your skills for a wide range of companies. It's a broader, more generalist preparation.

Prepare for **DoorDash first** if you are comfortable with fundamentals and need to ramp up on advanced graph/tree problems and complex system design discussions often embedded in their questions. The higher density of Hard problems means you should only tackle DoorDash-specific prep after you are already confident solving medium-level problems consistently and quickly. This preparation is more specialized.

Ultimately, the shared core of Array, String, and Hash Table problems means starting with either will yield benefits. Prioritize based on whether you need to strengthen your overall problem-solving muscle (Salesforce) or drill into advanced graph traversal and complex scenarios (DoorDash).
