Societe Generale’s coding interviews for software engineering roles are a direct assessment of your problem-solving and coding fundamentals. Typically conducted online, the technical screen focuses on algorithmic challenges that mirror real-world data processing and financial logic. The process is structured and consistent, making targeted preparation highly effective.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: **Easy (33%)** and **Medium (67%)** questions dominate, with **Hard (0%)** questions being absent. This breakdown is strategic. Societe Generale prioritizes **reliable, clean, and efficient code** over esoteric algorithmic mastery. An "Easy" question tests your basic competency and attention to detail—can you handle edge cases and write bug-free code under time pressure? The "Medium" questions form the core of the evaluation, assessing your ability to apply standard algorithms to moderately complex problems, often involving data manipulation. The absence of "Hard" problems means you should double down on mastering fundamentals rather than chasing advanced graph or DP problems. Your goal is to solve the Medium problems optimally and the Easy ones flawlessly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Based on the data, these five topics are non-negotiable. Mastery here will cover the vast majority of problems you'll encounter.

- **String:** Expect frequent manipulation, parsing, and validation tasks. Key patterns include two-pointer techniques and sliding windows for substring problems.
- **Greedy:** Often appears in scheduling or optimization problems. The challenge is proving or recognizing the greedy choice property.
- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Focus on in-place operations, prefix sums, and two-pointer techniques for sorting or searching.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A core topic for Medium problems. Start with classic 1D and 2D DP patterns for problems like maximum sum, counting ways, or string matching.
- **Hash Table:** Your primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Essential for frequency counting, memoization in DP, and solving "find a pair" problems.

For Societe Generale, **Dynamic Programming** is often the differentiator in Medium problems. A classic pattern is the "House Robber" or "Maximum Sum Subarray" variant. Here’s the most efficient **Kadane's Algorithm** approach for the maximum sum subarray problem, implemented in three languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    max_current = max_global = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # The core DP decision: extend the subarray or start a new one
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current)
    return max_global
```

```javascript
function maxSubarray(nums) {
  let maxCurrent = nums[0];
  let maxGlobal = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // The core DP decision: extend the subarray or start a new one
    maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
    maxGlobal = Math.max(maxGlobal, maxCurrent);
  }
  return maxGlobal;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int maxCurrent = nums[0];
    int maxGlobal = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // The core DP decision: extend the subarray or start a new one
        maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
        maxGlobal = Math.max(maxGlobal, maxCurrent);
    }
    return maxGlobal;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate one day each to **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table**. Solve 10-15 problems per topic, focusing on Easy and Medium. Use platforms that provide company-tagged questions.
- **Weeks 3-4: Core Algorithms.** Spend 3-4 days on **Dynamic Programming**. Start with 1D DP (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs), move to 2D DP (Knapsack, LCS), and finish with Kadane's Algorithm and DP on strings. Follow this with 2-3 days on **Greedy** algorithms, practicing classic interval and scheduling problems.
- **Week 5: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Mix problems from all five key topics. Prioritize Medium difficulty. Complete 2-3 timed mock interviews (90 minutes each) simulating the real environment.
- **Week 6: Review & Polish.** Re-solve your previously marked "tricky" problems. Drill **Easy** problems to build speed and confidence. Systematically review time and space complexity for all your practiced solutions.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Societe Generale values maintainable code. Use clear variable names, consistent formatting, and concise comments. A readable, correct solution is better than a clever, opaque one.
2.  **Communicate Your DP State.** When tackling a Dynamic Programming problem, verbally define your `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` array before you write code. For example, "Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum profit achievable up to day `i`." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Validate Input and Handle Edges.** Explicitly check for null/empty inputs, single-element arrays, and negative numbers. Stating these checks shows professional diligence.
4.  **Time-Box Your Struggle.** If you're stuck on a problem for more than 10-15 minutes, write down a brute-force approach. This creates a starting point for optimization and shows you can make progress under constraints.

Success in Societe Generale's coding interviews hinges on methodical preparation for their specific difficulty and topic profile. Focus on clean code, core patterns, and consistent practice.
