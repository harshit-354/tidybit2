Getting an offer from Waymo means proving you can solve the complex, real-world computational problems that underpin autonomous driving. Their coding interviews are notoriously rigorous, focusing heavily on algorithmic problem-solving and data structure implementation under pressure. You'll typically face multiple rounds of technical interviews, each consisting of 1-2 coding questions, often with a strong emphasis on optimization and edge cases.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 18 recent Waymo coding questions reveals a clear, challenging profile:

- **Easy:** 1 (6%)
- **Medium:** 9 (50%)
- **Hard:** 8 (44%)

This distribution is telling. While half the questions are at a standard Medium level, a staggering 44% are Hard. This means you cannot just be competent; you must be excellent. The single Easy question is likely a warm-up or a screening filter. The interview is designed to push you into complex problem spaces—think multi-step graph traversals, dynamic programming on 2D grids, or intricate simulations. Success requires not just solving the problem but doing so with optimal time and space complexity and handling all corner cases flawlessly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a clear set of high-priority areas. Master these.

- **Array & Matrix:** Foundational for representing sensor data, grids, and maps. Expect manipulations, searches, and in-place algorithms.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Critical for caching states, counting frequencies, and building adjacency lists for graph problems.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The core of graph and tree traversal. DFS is key for exploration, backtracking, and connected components. BFS is essential for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and level-order traversals.

Given that Matrix and Graph (DFS/BFS) problems are so prevalent, a fundamental pattern is **traversing a 2D grid**. This is the bedrock for many "island" or "region" problems common in autonomous systems contexts (e.g., processing LiDAR or camera data grids).

```python
def dfs_grid_traversal(grid, r, c):
    """DFS to mark all connected land cells (value 1) as visited."""
    if (r < 0 or r >= len(grid) or
        c < 0 or c >= len(grid[0]) or
        grid[r][c] != 1):
        return

    grid[r][c] = 0  # Mark as visited
    # Explore 4-directionally
    dfs_grid_traversal(grid, r + 1, c)
    dfs_grid_traversal(grid, r - 1, c)
    dfs_grid_traversal(grid, r, c + 1)
    dfs_grid_traversal(grid, r, c - 1)

# Example: Count number of islands (connected components of '1's)
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dfs_grid_traversal(grid, i, j)
                count += 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function dfsGridTraversal(grid, r, c) {
  // DFS to mark all connected land cells (value 1) as visited.
  if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] !== 1) {
    return;
  }

  grid[r][c] = 0; // Mark as visited
  // Explore 4-directionally
  dfsGridTraversal(grid, r + 1, c);
  dfsGridTraversal(grid, r - 1, c);
  dfsGridTraversal(grid, r, c + 1);
  dfsGridTraversal(grid, r, c - 1);
}

// Example: Count number of islands
function numIslands(grid) {
  if (!grid || grid.length === 0) return 0;
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
        dfsGridTraversal(grid, i, j);
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public void dfsGridTraversal(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    // DFS to mark all connected land cells (value '1') as visited.
    if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length ||
        c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length ||
        grid[r][c] != '1') {
        return;
    }

    grid[r][c] = '0'; // Mark as visited
    // Explore 4-directionally
    dfsGridTraversal(grid, r + 1, c);
    dfsGridTraversal(grid, r - 1, c);
    dfsGridTraversal(grid, r, c + 1);
    dfsGridTraversal(grid, r, c - 1);
}

// Example: Count number of islands
public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                dfsGridTraversal(grid, i, j);
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 6-Week Study Plan

With the high proportion of Hard problems, a superficial approach will fail. Follow this intensive plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Solidify fundamentals: Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Sets, Stacks, Queues.
- Deep dive into the top topics: Implement DFS, BFS, and matrix traversal from scratch. Solve 15-20 Medium problems on these specific topics.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Hard Problems**

- Move to advanced patterns: Dynamic Programming (especially 2D), Dijkstra's/A\* for weighted graphs, advanced graph algorithms (Topological Sort, Union Find), and backtracking.
- Start incorporating Hard problems. Aim for 2-3 per week initially, focusing on understanding the solution approach thoroughly before coding.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Simulation**

- Conduct mock interviews under timed conditions (60-75 minutes). Use platforms that provide Waymo-specific questions.
- Every problem you solve, verbalize your thought process. Practice identifying time/space complexity immediately.
- In the final week, review all your notes and re-solve the hardest problems you encountered without looking at the solution.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize Relentlessly.** For Medium problems at Waymo, a brute-force solution is often a rejection. Always state the brute-force complexity, then immediately work towards the optimal approach. For Hard problems, even a sub-optimal but working solution is a good start, but you must discuss paths to optimization.
2.  **Clarify, Then Code.** Autonomous driving problems are full of edge cases. Before writing a single line, ask clarifying questions. "Can the grid be empty?" "Is the graph directed?" "What should be returned if there's no path?" Document these assumptions.
3.  **Test with Corner Cases.** After writing your code, walk through it with small, edge-case inputs. An empty input, a single-element grid, a graph with a cycle, or a path that requires backtracking. This demonstrates rigorous thinking.
4.  **Know Your Graphs Cold.** Given the domain, graph traversal (DFS/BFS) and shortest-path algorithms are not just likely—they are guaranteed. Be able to implement them iteratively and recursively, and know when to use one over the other.

The Waymo interview is a marathon of difficult problems. Your preparation must match its intensity. Focus on depth over breadth, master the core patterns, and practice articulating complex solutions under time pressure.
