When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each firm is crucial. TikTok and Citadel, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes. TikTok, a social media giant, emphasizes a broad range of problems with high volume, reflecting its fast-paced, product-driven engineering culture. Citadel, a leading quantitative hedge fund, focuses on a smaller, more intense set of problems, prioritizing deep analytical thinking and performance-critical solutions. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark difference in approach. TikTok has a massive publicly cataloged question bank of **383 questions**, heavily weighted toward medium difficulty (260 questions). This high volume suggests that while the fundamental concepts tested are standard, the specific problems you might encounter are highly variable. The large pool indicates that rote memorization of "TikTok questions" is less effective than mastering underlying patterns. The difficulty distribution (42 Easy, 260 Medium, 81 Hard) aligns with a typical software engineering interview, where medium problems form the core assessment.

In contrast, Citadel's catalog is much more concentrated at **96 questions**, with a significantly higher proportion of hard problems (31 Hard vs. 59 Medium). This lower volume but higher difficulty skew signals an interview that digs deeper into complex problem-solving and optimization. You are more likely to face a single, challenging problem where discussing trade-offs, edge cases, and efficient implementation is as important as arriving at a correct solution. The expectation is for polished, optimal code under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four core areas: **Array, String, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Hash Table**. This overlap is excellent news for preparers, as strength in these fundamentals serves both interviews.

- **Arrays & Strings:** These form the backbone of most algorithmic questions. Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and string manipulation.
- **Hash Tables:** Critical for efficient lookups and frequency counting, often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A major differentiator for hard questions. Both companies use DP to assess problem decomposition and optimization skills.

The primary difference lies in context and depth. A TikTok array problem might involve designing a feature-related algorithm (e.g., managing a video feed), while a Citadel array problem could model a financial data stream requiring minimal latency. For Citadel, DP and array problems may more frequently involve mathematical modeling or require space-optimized bottom-up solutions.

```python
# Example: A DP problem like "Coin Change" could appear at both.
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Citadel first**. Here’s why: mastering Citadel’s profile builds a stronger foundation. If you can consistently solve a high proportion of medium and hard problems on core topics like DP and arrays, you will be over-prepared for the majority of TikTok’s medium-difficulty questions. The reverse is not true. Focusing only on TikTok’s broader, slightly easier set may leave you under-equipped for the depth and optimization required at Citadel.

Your strategy should be:

1.  **Build Core Depth:** Grind DP, array, and string problems on platforms like LeetCode, aiming for high proficiency on medium and hard difficulties. Understand time/space trade-offs intimately.
2.  **Simulate Citadel Intensity:** Practice solving 1-2 hard problems under interview conditions, focusing on clean code and clear explanation.
3.  **Expand Breadth for TikTok:** Once core topics are solid, you can efficiently practice a wider variety of problems to cover TikTok’s larger question bank, adding topics like graphs and trees which, while less prominent, still appear.

This approach ensures you are competitively prepared for the more demanding interview (Citadel) while efficiently covering the broader one (TikTok).
