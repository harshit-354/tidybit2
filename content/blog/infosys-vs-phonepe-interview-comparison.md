When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Infosys and PhonePe represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a global IT services giant with a broad hiring scope, and the other is a high-growth fintech product company. Their question banks on TidyBit reveal clear differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis, which should directly shape your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a significant story. Infosys's list of **158 questions** is substantially larger than PhonePe's **102 questions**. This volume reflects Infosys's scale of hiring across experience levels and roles.

More critically, the difficulty distribution is starkly different:

- **Infosys:** Easy (42), Medium (82), Hard (34). The spread is more balanced, with a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. This suggests a focus on assessing core problem-solving competency across a wide applicant pool.
- **PhonePe:** Easy (3), Medium (63), Hard (36). The near absence of Easy questions and the high proportion of Hard problems signal a highly selective process aimed at evaluating advanced algorithmic thinking and optimization skills, typical of competitive product-based company interviews.

This means that for PhonePe, you must be comfortable with complex problem transformations and optimal solutions. For Infosys, a firm grasp on fundamental patterns and reliable execution on Medium problems is crucial.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, making these absolute priority areas. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The divergence comes in their secondary focuses:

- **Infosys** emphasizes **String** manipulation and **Math** problems. These topics often test careful implementation and mathematical insight. A common pattern involves iterating and manipulating strings or using number properties.
- **PhonePe** emphasizes **Sorting** and **Hash Table** usage. This points to a strong focus on algorithms that require efficient data organization and lookup—key for performance-critical systems. Many problems will involve sorting as a preprocessing step or using hash maps for O(1) access.

Consider this classic "Two Sum" problem. While both companies might ask it, PhonePe's focus could lead to a follow-up requiring handling of sorted data or large datasets.

```python
# Hash Table approach (O(n) time)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# If input is sorted, two-pointer approach (O(n log n) time if unsorted)
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    nums.sort()  # Sorting step aligns with PhonePe's focus
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Hash Table approach
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Two-pointer for sorted (or to be sorted) input
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left, right];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Hash Table approach
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Two-pointer for sorted input
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
    Arrays.sort(nums); // Sorting step
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[] {left, right};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your target role and current skill level.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting roles in IT services and consulting. The broader topic mix (Strings, Math) and larger volume of Medium-difficulty questions provide a solid foundation in general problem-solving. Succeeding here builds the confidence and breadth needed to tackle more specialized lists.

**Prepare for PhonePe first if:** You are aiming for product-based or fintech companies and already have a strong command of fundamentals. The high concentration of Medium and Hard problems on focused topics (Sorting, Hash Tables) demands deep, optimized solutions. Mastering this list will rigorously test your algorithmic chops and prepare you for the most challenging interviews. However, you may need to supplement with String and Math practice if also applying to companies like Infosys.

In summary, use Infosys's list for breadth and foundational strength, and PhonePe's list for depth and advanced optimization under pressure.
