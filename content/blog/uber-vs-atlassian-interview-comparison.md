When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Uber and Atlassian, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty, and focus. Uber's process is known for its high volume and algorithmic rigor, often mirroring other FAANG-level companies. Atlassian's process, while still challenging, tends to be more focused and can place a stronger emphasis on practical problem-solving and system design fundamentals. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation to these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of reported questions sets these companies apart. Uber has a massive bank of **381 questions** on platforms like LeetCode, dwarfing Atlassian's **62 questions**. This volume makes Uber's interview process less predictable and demands broader preparation.

The difficulty distributions also differ significantly:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103)**: The spread is heavily weighted towards **Medium (224)** and **Hard (103)** problems. This indicates an interview loop that deeply tests advanced algorithmic knowledge, optimization, and handling edge cases. You must be comfortable with complex problem transformations.
- **Atlassian (E7/M43/H12)**: The majority of questions are **Medium (43)**, with a smaller proportion of Hard problems. This suggests a strong focus on core concepts applied cleverly, rather than on the most esoteric algorithms. The lower volume also means known questions have a higher chance of appearing.

**Example: A "Hard" Two-Phase Problem**
A common pattern is a problem that can be broken into two distinct algorithmic steps.

```python
# Python: Find max profit with a cooldown (a DP problem akin to Uber style)
def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(n)]
    dp[0][1] = -prices[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])  # sell
        dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-2][0] - prices[i])  # buy (cooldown)
    return dp[n-1][0]
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: Merge intervals (a common Atlassian-style medium problem)
function merge(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length < 2) return intervals;
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [intervals[0]];
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const last = merged[merged.length - 1];
    if (intervals[i][0] <= last[1]) {
      last[1] = Math.max(last[1], intervals[i][1]);
    } else {
      merged.push(intervals[i]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// Java: Design an LRU Cache (tests fundamentals for both)
class LRUCache {
    class DLinkedNode {
        int key, value;
        DLinkedNode prev, next;
    }
    private void addNode(DLinkedNode node) {
        node.prev = head;
        node.next = head.next;
        head.next.prev = node;
        head.next = node;
    }
    private void removeNode(DLinkedNode node) {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
    }
    private void moveToHead(DLinkedNode node) {
        removeNode(node);
        addNode(node);
    }
    private DLinkedNode popTail() {
        DLinkedNode res = tail.prev;
        removeNode(res);
        return res;
    }
    private Map<Integer, DLinkedNode> cache = new HashMap<>();
    private int size, capacity;
    private DLinkedNode head, tail;
    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.size = 0;
        this.capacity = capacity;
        head = new DLinkedNode();
        tail = new DLinkedNode();
        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }
    public int get(int key) {
        DLinkedNode node = cache.get(key);
        if (node == null) return -1;
        moveToHead(node);
        return node.value;
    }
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        DLinkedNode node = cache.get(key);
        if (node == null) {
            DLinkedNode newNode = new DLinkedNode();
            newNode.key = key;
            newNode.value = value;
            cache.put(key, newNode);
            addNode(newNode);
            ++size;
            if (size > capacity) {
                DLinkedNode tail = popTail();
                cache.remove(tail.key);
                --size;
            }
        } else {
            node.value = value;
            moveToHead(node);
        }
    }
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, Hash Table, and String** manipulation. This is the core foundation for most algorithmic interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key divergence is in the fourth most common topic:

- **Uber**: **Dynamic Programming** is prominent. You must prepare for multi-state DP, sequence problems, and optimization challenges. Graph traversal (BFS/DFS) is also critical for their domain.
- **Atlassian**: **Sorting** and its applications are more frequently tested. Problems often involve organizing data before applying a greedy or two-pointer technique. System design questions may also lean towards scalable data modeling and collaboration features.

This means your Uber prep must include deep DP and graph practice, while for Atlassian, mastering sorted array manipulations and clean, object-oriented design is vital.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both, **start with Uber preparation**. Here’s why:

1.  **Coverage**: Preparing for Uber's large bank of Medium and Hard problems will inherently cover the core and advanced topics needed for Atlassian. The reverse is not true; Atlassian-focused prep may leave gaps for Uber's DP and graph depth.
2.  **Intensity**: Building the stamina and problem-solving speed for Uber's style will make Atlassian's focused Medium problems feel more manageable.
3.  **Strategy**: Once you have a strong foundation from Uber prep, you can efficiently shift to Atlassian by:
    - Reviewing their specific, smaller question list.
    - Emphasizing sorting-based solutions and clean code structure.
    - Practicing concise explanations that connect your solution to real-world product scenarios.

In short, use Uber prep to build your algorithmic engine, then tune it for Atlassian's specific track.
