Dynamic Programming (DP) is a core assessment area at Tekion, representing over a third of their technical question pool. This emphasis signals that the company values engineers who can design efficient, scalable solutions for complex problems. Tekion builds cloud-native platforms for the automotive industry, dealing with real-time data processing, inventory optimization, and complex business workflows. These domains inherently involve problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure—the classic hallmarks of DP. Mastering DP demonstrates your ability to move beyond brute-force approaches and write performant code that can handle large-scale, resource-intensive operations, a critical skill for their backend and data systems.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Tekion's DP questions typically fall into two categories. First, you'll encounter **classical DP problems** that test your foundational knowledge. These include variations on the knapsack problem (likely for resource allocation scenarios), longest common subsequence (relevant for data comparison tasks), and minimum path sum. Second, expect **applied or "disguised" DP problems**. These are word problems that map to a standard DP pattern but are framed within a business context, such as optimizing transaction batches, scheduling service appointments, or allocating warehouse space. The key is to recognize the underlying pattern—whether it's a 1D array, a 2D grid, or a more complex state transition.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by solidifying the core principle: DP is "smart recursion." For any problem, first try to define a recursive solution, then identify overlapping subproblems, and finally apply memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up) to eliminate redundant calculations. Always articulate this thought process during your interview.

A fundamental pattern is the **Fibonacci sequence**, which illustrates the transition from exponential-time recursion to linear-time DP. Here is the progression using memoization:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def fib_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
function fibMemo(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  if (memo[n] === undefined) {
    memo[n] = fibMemo(n - 1, memo) + fibMemo(n - 2, memo);
  }
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    private int fibMemo(int n, HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        if (!memo.containsKey(n)) {
            memo.put(n, fibMemo(n-1, memo) + fibMemo(n-2, memo));
        }
        return memo.get(n);
    }
    public int fib(int n) {
        return fibMemo(n, new HashMap<>());
    }
}
```

</div>

## Recommended Practice Order

Do not attempt random problems. Follow a structured progression:

1.  **Foundation:** Master 1D DP (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber).
2.  **2D & Grids:** Practice problems like Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum, and Longest Common Subsequence.
3.  **Knapsack & Variations:** Understand 0/1 Knapsack, then subset sum, and unbounded knapsack.
4.  **Tekion-Specific Practice:** Finally, focus on problems tagged for Tekion on platforms like TidyBit to familiarize yourself with their style and difficulty.
