String matching isn’t just about finding a substring. It’s a fundamental skill that tests your ability to manipulate data, design efficient algorithms, and handle edge cases. In coding interviews, string problems appear everywhere—from validating user input to parsing logs or implementing search features. Our data shows 32 core questions, with a surprising 44% rated Hard, indicating that interviewers use these problems to separate candidates who understand brute force from those who grasp optimal patterns.

## Common Patterns

Mastering a few core techniques will let you tackle most string matching problems efficiently.

**1. Two Pointers / Sliding Window**
This is the go-to for problems involving substrings, palindromes, or comparisons without extra space. You maintain a window that slides over the string, adjusting its boundaries based on certain conditions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

</div>

**2. Hashing for Frequency & Anagrams**
Use a hash map (or a fixed-size array for lowercase letters) to count character frequencies. This is essential for anagram checks and substring problems with specific character counts.

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import Counter

def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = {};
  for (let char of s) count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
  for (let char of t) {
    if (!count[char]) return false;
    count[char]--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
    int[] count = new int[26];
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) count[c - 'a']++;
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (--count[c - 'a'] < 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

</div>

**3. Advanced Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp)**
For Hard problems, you often need more than a sliding window. The **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** algorithm preprocesses the pattern to achieve O(n+m) substring search. **Rabin-Karp** uses rolling hashes for pattern matching, useful for finding multiple patterns or repeated substrings. Knowing these by name and their trade-offs is a strong signal.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our dataset of 32 questions splits as: **Easy (10, 31%), Medium (8, 25%), Hard (14, 44%)**. This heavy skew toward Hard is revealing.

- **Easy** problems test basic manipulation: reversing, palindrome checks, simple anagrams. They are warm-ups.
- **Medium** problems combine patterns, like using a sliding window with a hash map to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Hard** problems dominate. They require you to implement or adapt advanced algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Aho-Corasick), handle complex dynamic programming states for regular expression matching, or optimize a brute-force solution with clever preprocessing. This split means interviewers reserve string problems to assess deep algorithmic knowledge.

## Which Companies Ask String Matching

String problems are a staple at top tech firms because they correlate with real-world tasks like search, data processing, and validation.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks Hard dynamic programming problems (e.g., regular expression matching) and advanced pattern matching.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) often use Medium-level problems involving sliding windows and hashing for system design rounds (e.g., log parsing, feature implementation).
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) and [Meta](/company/meta) favor practical string manipulation, from Medium anagram groups to Hard substring search optimizations relevant to data feeds and social text processing.

## Study Tips

1.  **Start with Frequency Arrays.** For problems with lowercase English letters, a 26-element integer array is faster and simpler than a hash map. Know when to use which.
2.  **Practice Sliding Window Variations.** Get comfortable with fixed-length and variable-length windows. Draw the window and pointers to visualize the invariants.
3.  **Memorize One Advanced Algorithm.** You don't need to know all of them in depth. Have a solid, implementable understanding of **KMP** for substring search. Be able to explain its LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array.
4.  **Simulate the Interview.** For Hard problems, talk through the brute-force solution first, then optimize. Interviewers want to see your thought process as much as your final code.
