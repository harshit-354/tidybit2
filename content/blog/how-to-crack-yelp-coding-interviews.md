Yelp’s coding interviews are designed to assess practical problem-solving skills relevant to building and scaling their local search and review platform. The process typically involves one or two technical phone screens focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via a collaborative code editor, followed by a virtual onsite with multiple rounds that may include system design and behavioral components. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 27 Yelp coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 7 Easy (26%), 15 Medium (56%), and 5 Hard (19%). This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy. The overwhelming majority of questions (over 80%) are at the Medium level or below. This indicates Yelp’s primary focus is on strong fundamentals and the ability to reliably solve common, practical problems under interview conditions, rather than on obscure, highly complex algorithms. The presence of Hard questions, however, means you should be prepared for at least one challenging problem that tests deeper algorithmic insight, often involving optimization or combining multiple concepts.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **String:** Frequently tested for parsing, validation, and manipulation tasks common in processing user-generated content like reviews and business names. Master techniques like two-pointers and sliding windows.
- **Array:** The foundation for most data manipulation problems. Expect questions on searching, sorting, and subarray problems.
- **Hash Table:** The most crucial data structure for achieving O(1) lookups and managing frequency counts. It’s often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution.
- **Sorting:** Rarely tested in isolation but is a critical preprocessing step for many array and string problems. Understand built-in sort functions and custom comparator logic.
- **Math:** Appears in problems involving business logic, ratings, distances, or other numerical properties. Focus on modular arithmetic and basic number theory.

The most important pattern across these topics is using a **Hash Table to track element frequencies or indices**, transforming an O(n²) nested loop solution into an O(n) single-pass solution. This is essential for problems like finding pairs, checking anagrams, or solving two-sum variants.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // No solution
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Solidify the top five topics (String, Array, Hash Table, Sorting, Math). For each, solve 10-15 curated Easy and Medium problems. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just the answer. Implement solutions in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Move to more complex Medium problems that combine topics (e.g., String + Hash Table, Array + Sorting). Practice explaining your thought process aloud as you solve. Begin timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem).

**Week 5: Mock Interviews & Hard Problems.** Simulate the real interview environment with a friend or using a platform. Complete 2-3 mock interviews per week. Dedicate time to understanding the solutions to Hard problems from Yelp’s question list, focusing on the optimization leap required.

**Week 6: Refinement & Review.** Revisit problems you found difficult. Systematically review all core data structures and their time/space complexities. Practice a few problems daily to stay sharp, but reduce intensity before your interview.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write code, state the brute-force approach and its complexity. Then, explain your plan for optimization. Verbalize your thoughts as you code. This turns a silent test into a collaborative session.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First.** A working, clean, brute-force solution is better than a broken, attempted-optimal one. Get a functional solution, then analyze and optimize if time permits. Always run through a small test case.
3.  **Think in Yelp's Domain.** When given a problem, consider if it relates to real-world Yelp scenarios—filtering search results, calculating proximity, deduplicating entries, or parsing review text. This context can sometimes hint at the expected data structures (e.g., hash tables for fast lookups, heaps for top-K items).
4.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use clear variable names, consistent indentation, and proper spacing. Include a docstring or comment if the logic is non-trivial. Handle edge cases (empty input, large values) explicitly.

Success in Yelp interviews hinges on methodical preparation focused on high-frequency topics and clear, communicative problem-solving. Start with the fundamentals, build up to integrated patterns, and practice articulating your reasoning.
