When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both LinkedIn and PayPal are prominent names, but their engineering interviews differ in volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation based on these distinct profiles rather than using a generic approach.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company on platforms like TidyBit. LinkedIn's list comprises **180 questions**, significantly larger than PayPal's **106 questions**. This suggests that LinkedIn's interview process is more extensively documented by candidates, possibly reflecting a broader range of problems or a longer-standing focus on algorithmic interviews.

The difficulty breakdown further highlights their different screening philosophies:

- **LinkedIn (E26/M117/H37):** The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty (~65% of questions). The Hard count is also substantial (~21%). This profile indicates LinkedIn places a strong emphasis on complex problem-solving and algorithmic optimization. You must be comfortable with challenging scenarios that extend beyond foundational concepts.
- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** While also Medium-dominant (~65%), the overall numbers are lower. The proportion of Hard questions is slightly less (~18%), and the Easy count is smaller. This points to an interview process that is still rigorous but may have a slightly more focused or predictable scope than LinkedIn's. The emphasis is firmly on solid, medium-level competency.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the essential backbone for interviews at both LinkedIn and PayPal. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

The key differentiator lies in the advanced topics:

- **LinkedIn** explicitly includes **Depth-First Search (DFS)** in its top list. This signals a strong focus on **graph and tree traversal problems**, which are common in systems dealing with networks, hierarchies (like the professional graph), or complex nested data. You must be adept at recursive and iterative graph algorithms.
- **PayPal** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic. This underscores the importance of **data manipulation, searching, and often, optimization of financial or transactional data sets**. Questions may frequently involve sorting as a key step in arriving at an efficient solution, testing your ability to choose and implement the optimal sorting strategy.

```python
# Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn focus)
def dfs(node, visited):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    # Process node here
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs(neighbor, visited)

# Example Sorting use-case (PayPal focus)
def process_transactions(transactions):
    # Sorting is often a critical first step
    transactions.sort(key=lambda t: t.timestamp)  # Or by amount, user_id, etc.
    # Then process the sorted list for analysis
    return find_fraud_patterns(transactions)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn focus)
function dfs(node, visited) {
  if (!node || visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  // Process node here
  for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {
    dfs(neighbor, visited);
  }
}

// Example Sorting use-case (PayPal focus)
function processTransactions(transactions) {
  // Sorting is often a critical first step
  transactions.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);
  // Then process the sorted list for analysis
  return findFraudPatterns(transactions);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn focus)
public void dfs(Node node, Set<Node> visited) {
    if (node == null || visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    // Process node here
    for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
        dfs(neighbor, visited);
    }
}

// Example Sorting use-case (PayPal focus)
public List<Transaction> processTransactions(List<Transaction> transactions) {
    // Sorting is often a critical first step
    transactions.sort(Comparator.comparing(Transaction::getTimestamp));
    // Then process the sorted list for analysis
    return findFraudPatterns(transactions);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **PayPal**. Its focused topic list (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) provides a perfect, high-yield foundation. Achieving fluency with these core topics, especially medium-difficulty problems involving sorting logic, will build the essential muscle memory required for any technical interview. This core competency directly transfers to LinkedIn's requirements.

Then, pivot to **LinkedIn**. Use the established core skills and layer on the advanced graph and tree algorithms, particularly DFS and its counterpart BFS. Practice converting real-world scenarios (like social connections or organizational charts) into graph problems. The larger question pool and higher density of Hard problems demand that you also practice time management and tackling multi-step, complex challenges under pressure.

In summary, PayPal's profile is an excellent benchmark for core algorithmic proficiency. LinkedIn's profile represents a broader, deeper challenge that requires additional, specialized graph knowledge. Master the foundation first, then expand your scope.
