When preparing for technical interviews, understanding a company's specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. LinkedIn and Yahoo, while both established tech giants, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company. On TidyBit, **LinkedIn** has a massive bank of **180 questions**, dwarfing **Yahoo's 64 questions**. This volume reflects LinkedIn's broader engineering scope and its reputation for a rigorous, multi-round interview process.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **LinkedIn (E26/M117/H37):** The interview is medium-heavy. A significant 65% of questions are medium difficulty, with a substantial 21% being hard. This indicates that while you must master fundamentals, LinkedIn consistently pushes into complex problem-solving and optimization.
- **Yahoo (E26/M32/H6):** The focus is overwhelmingly on fundamentals. A full 91% of questions are Easy or Medium, with Hard questions making up less than 10%. Yahoo's process seems more geared toward assessing solid competency in core concepts rather than solving esoteric algorithm puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures, but with different levels of depth.

**High-Overlap Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table questions are top priorities for both. You cannot afford to be weak here.

- **Array/String Manipulation:** Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and in-place operations.
- **Hash Table:** Crucial for efficient lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, duplicates, and complements (like Two Sum).

**Diverging Focus:**

- **LinkedIn's Additional Depth:** LinkedIn's fourth most frequent topic is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a clear signal that tree and graph traversal is a key assessment area. Mastering recursive and iterative DFS for problems involving paths, connectivity, or search is essential.
- **Yahoo's Practical Bent:** Yahoo's fourth topic is **Sorting**. This often pairs with core topics (e.g., "sort an array to enable a two-pointer solution") and suggests a focus on practical data manipulation and preparation steps for other algorithms.

Here is a typical pattern where topic focus changes the question's nature:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# A common "Two Sum" variant. Both companies might ask this.
# Yahoo might emphasize the sorting/hash map approach.
# LinkedIn might extend it to a tree (DFS) context.

def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# LinkedIn might ask a DFS-based analogue on a tree.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_target(root, k):
    def dfs(node, seen):
        if not node:
            return False
        complement = k - node.val
        if complement in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(node.val)
        return dfs(node.left, seen) or dfs(node.right, seen)
    return dfs(root, set())
```

```javascript
// Common "Two Sum" - core for both.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// LinkedIn DFS extension on a tree.
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function findTarget(root, k) {
  const seen = new Set();
  function dfs(node) {
    if (!node) return false;
    const complement = k - node.val;
    if (seen.has(complement)) return true;
    seen.add(node.val);
    return dfs(node.left) || dfs(node.right);
  }
  return dfs(root);
}
```

```java
// Common "Two Sum" - core for both.
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// LinkedIn DFS extension on a tree.
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean findTarget(TreeNode root, int k) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        return dfs(root, k, seen);
    }
    private boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int k, Set<Integer> seen) {
        if (node == null) return false;
        int complement = k - node.val;
        if (seen.contains(complement)) return true;
        seen.add(node.val);
        return dfs(node.left, k, seen) || dfs(node.right, k, seen);
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Yahoo first**. Its smaller, more fundamental question set serves as an excellent foundation. Mastering the Easy and Medium problems on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting will build the core competency needed for most interviews, including LinkedIn's.

Once that base is solid, transition to **LinkedIn preparation**. This involves:

1.  Solving a higher volume of Medium-difficulty problems to build stamina.
2.  Deliberately practicing Hard problems, especially those involving optimization of core algorithms.
3.  Dedicating significant time to **Depth-First Search** and related tree/graph paradigms, which are a clear differentiator in their question bank.

This sequential approach ensures you build a broad, strong foundation before tackling the greater depth and breadth required for LinkedIn's process.
