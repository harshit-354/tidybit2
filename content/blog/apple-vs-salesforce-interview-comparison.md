When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your efficiency. Apple and Salesforce, while both leaders in their respective domains, present distinct interview landscapes. Apple's process is known for its depth and integration of systems thinking, whereas Salesforce often emphasizes clean, scalable solutions to business logic problems. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals crucial differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and topical focus that should inform your study strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a clear disparity in the number of documented questions. Apple's repository is substantially larger, with **356 total questions** compared to Salesforce's **189**. This suggests that Apple's interview process has been more extensively documented, possibly due to a longer history of standardized technical screening or a more active candidate community.

More telling is the breakdown by difficulty:

- **Apple:** 100 Easy, 206 Medium, 50 Hard
- **Salesforce:** 27 Easy, 113 Medium, 49 Hard

Apple's distribution is heavily skewed toward **Medium-difficulty questions**, which constitute about 58% of its total. This aligns with the general expectation that most on-site interview rounds will present challenges at this level. Salesforce, while also Medium-heavy (60%), has a notably higher **proportion of Hard questions** relative to its total (26% vs. Apple's 14%). This could indicate that Salesforce's process includes more complex problem-solving rounds or places a higher premium on optimizing solutions under constraints.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong, almost identical core focus on fundamental data structures and algorithms. The primary topics for both are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is excellent news for candidates, as mastering these areas provides a strong foundation for interviews at either company.

The key difference lies in the _application_ and _context_ of these problems.

- **Apple** questions may more frequently involve lower-level optimizations, memory management, or integrating algorithmic solutions with systems concepts. A problem might involve efficiently processing sensor data (arrays) or designing a cache (hash table).
- **Salesforce** questions often lean toward data processing, relationship mapping (akin to its CRM objects), and business logic. You might encounter more problems involving string manipulation for data validation, array operations for batch processing, or graph-like traversals for hierarchical data.

Here is a classic overlapping problem—a two-sum variation—implemented in core languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the significant overlap in core topics, you should **prepare for the fundamentals first, not the company**. Start by achieving fluency in arrays, strings, hash tables, and dynamic programming. Use the high volume of Apple's Medium questions for broad practice to build speed and pattern recognition.

Once fundamentals are solid, tailor your final preparation:

- If preparing for **Salesforce**, allocate extra time for mastering Hard problems and practice framing solutions in contexts that involve data relationships and multi-step processing.
- If preparing for **Apple**, ensure your Medium problem skills are exceptionally strong and polished. Supplement with systems design practice, as algorithmic questions may be intertwined with design discussions.

Ultimately, a candidate well-prepared for one will be largely prepared for the other. The shared core means efficiency in study; the differences in context mean you must sharpen your skills on the specific type of problem narrative each company prefers.
