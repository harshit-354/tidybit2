When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and problem types each company favors can dramatically increase your efficiency. TikTok and Snapchat, while both major players in social media, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus areas. A targeted approach to their question banks is crucial.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of their respective question pools.

**TikTok** has a massive, well-documented repository of **383 questions** on platforms like TidyBit. The distribution (42 Easy, 260 Medium, 81 Hard) reveals a clear emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**. This large volume suggests that TikTok's interviews pull from a broad set of algorithmic challenges, and candidates must be prepared for a wide variety of scenarios. The high number of Medium questions indicates they test for strong, consistent fundamentals under pressure.

**Snapchat** has a more focused set of **99 questions** (6 Easy, 62 Medium, 31 Hard). Notably, the **proportion of Hard problems is significantly higher** (~31%) compared to TikTok (~21%). This smaller but sharper question bank implies Snapchat interviews may dive deeper into complex problem-solving, often building upon core concepts with additional constraints or optimization requirements.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are prevalent at both, forming the essential toolkit for any interview.

The key divergence lies in their advanced algorithmic preferences:

- **TikTok** shows a marked emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with problems involving optimization, counting, or maximizing/minimizing outcomes, which are common in feed algorithms, resource allocation, or pathfinding.
- **Snapchat** frequently tests **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This points towards a focus on problems involving **shortest paths, level-order traversal, or exploring states in social graphs, networks, or UI layers**—all highly relevant to a messaging and camera platform.

Here is a practical example illustrating the difference in focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# TikTok-style DP Problem: Climbing Stairs (a classic DP pattern)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Snapchat-style BFS Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
function levelOrder(root) {
  if (!root) return [];
  const result = [];
  const queue = [root];
  while (queue.length) {
    const levelSize = queue.length;
    const currentLevel = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      currentLevel.push(node.val);
      if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
      if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
    }
    result.push(currentLevel);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
// Snapchat-style BFS Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null) return result;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int levelSize = queue.size();
        List<Integer> currentLevel = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode node = queue.poll();
            currentLevel.add(node.val);
            if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
            if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
        }
        result.add(currentLevel);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company's focus.

**Start with TikTok if:** You are early in your prep cycle or want to build broad, solid fundamentals. The vast number of Medium problems provides extensive practice across common patterns. Mastering this set will make you competitive for many companies. Prioritize Array, String, Hash Table, and **dedicate significant time to Dynamic Programming**.

**Start with Snapchat if:** You have strong fundamentals and need to sharpen your skills for more complex, in-depth problems. The higher concentration of Hard questions requires advanced optimization and clean code under pressure. Ensure you are exceptionally comfortable with **BFS/DFS graph traversal and tree algorithms** alongside the core topics.

Ultimately, the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) are non-negotiable for both. Build that foundation first, then branch out into TikTok's DP depth or Snapchat's BFS and Hard-problem intensity based on your target.
