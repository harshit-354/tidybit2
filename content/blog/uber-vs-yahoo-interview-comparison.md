When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. A comparison between Uber and Yahoo, based on their tagged questions on TidyBit, shows significant differences in scale, difficulty, and focus, which should directly inform your study strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of available data. Uber has **381** tagged questions, while Yahoo has **64**. This doesn't necessarily mean Uber asks more questions, but it indicates a much larger and more active pool of reported interview experiences, making Uber's question patterns more predictable for preparation.

The difficulty distribution is also telling:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The profile is heavily weighted towards Medium and Hard questions, with Hard problems making up a significant portion (27%). This reflects Uber's reputation for a rigorous, algorithm-intensive interview process focused on complex problem-solving, often involving system design components for senior roles.
- **Yahoo (E26/M32/H6):** The distribution is more balanced towards Easy and Medium, with only a small fraction (9%) of Hard questions. This suggests a process that strongly tests foundational data structures and algorithms competency, with potentially less emphasis on the most advanced algorithmic puzzles.

This contrast means preparing for Uber requires deep mastery and extensive practice on challenging problems, while Yahoo preparation can start with a very strong grasp of fundamentals.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, with significant overlap in their top topics.

**Shared Top Topics:** Array, Hash Table, String.
These are the absolute essentials. You must be proficient in manipulating these data structures in any language.

```python
# Example: Using Hash Table (dictionary) to solve a common "two-sum" pattern.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Usage for an Array problem
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Using Hash Table (Map) to solve a common "two-sum" pattern.
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Usage for an Array problem
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: Using Hash Table (HashMap) to solve a common "two-sum" pattern.
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

**Key Differentiator:** Dynamic Programming.

- **Uber** lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. This aligns with its difficulty profile; expect complex problems involving optimization, memoization, or tabulation.
- **Yahoo** does not have DP as a top topic, instead listing **Sorting**. This points to a focus on foundational algorithmic techniques and data manipulation.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Yahoo first**. Its smaller, more fundamental question set serves as an excellent foundation. Mastering the core topics of Array, Hash Table, String, and Sorting will build the muscle memory needed for more complex problems. Success here validates your grasp of the basics.

Then, transition to **Uber** preparation. This requires layering on advanced study. Use your solid foundation to tackle the larger volume of Medium questions and then systematically practice Hard problems, with dedicated focus on Dynamic Programming patterns. The skills you build for Uber will comprehensively cover what's needed for Yahoo, but not vice-versa.

In short, Yahoo's process tests for strong fundamentals, while Uber's tests for advanced algorithmic mastery under pressure. Start with the fundamentals.
