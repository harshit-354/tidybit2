When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Google and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum: one is a top-tier product-based tech giant, and the other is a global IT services and consulting leader. A direct comparison of their frequently reported interview questions reveals significant differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis, which should guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions associated with each company is the first major differentiator. On platforms like LeetCode, Google has a tagged pool of over **2,217 questions**, while TCS has **217**. This disparity reflects both the number of interviews conducted and the depth of their question banks.

More telling is the breakdown by difficulty:

- **Google**: 588 Easy (26.5%), 1153 Medium (52%), 476 Hard (21.5%)
- **TCS**: 94 Easy (43%), 103 Medium (47.5%), 20 Hard (9%)

Google's distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium and Hard** problems, with Hard questions making up over one-fifth of its pool. This aligns with its reputation for highly competitive, algorithm-intensive interviews that test advanced problem-solving and optimization. In contrast, TCS's question pool is dominated by **Easy and Medium** problems, with a minimal percentage of Hard questions. This suggests a focus on assessing strong foundational knowledge, clean code, and logical reasoning rather than solving novel, highly complex algorithmic challenges under extreme time pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies frequently test core computer science fundamentals, with significant overlap in the top topics.

**Common Ground (Array, String, Hash Table):**
These are foundational data structures. Both companies expect mastery here, but the complexity of application differs.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (a common Hash Table problem)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# For Google, a follow-up might involve a sorted array (Two Pointers)
# or handling a massive dataset (system design implications).
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

</div>

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Google** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. DP problems (e.g., Longest Increasing Subsequence, Edit Distance) are a staple for testing optimal substructure thinking and are often in the Medium-Hard range.
- **TCS** prominently lists **Two Pointers**. This technique is often used for efficient searching and manipulation in sorted arrays or strings (e.g., removing duplicates, finding a pair with a given sum). It's a fundamental and highly practical pattern.

This contrast highlights Google's emphasis on **advanced algorithmic paradigms** (DP, Graph Theory, Backtracking) versus TCS's stronger focus on **efficient implementation of fundamental techniques** on common data structures.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and timeline.

**Prepare for TCS first if:** You are early in your coding interview journey or are strengthening your core fundamentals. The TCS question pool provides an excellent, focused set of problems to build proficiency with arrays, strings, hash maps, and two-pointer techniques. Success here builds the confidence and muscle memory needed to tackle more complex problems. It serves as a solid foundation for any technical interview.

**Prepare for Google first if:** You are aiming for top-tier product companies or have already solidified your grasp of the basics. Google's questions require you to layer advanced concepts (like DP and complex graph algorithms) onto that strong foundation. Preparing for Google is more demanding and time-intensive. If Google is your goal, your study plan must allocate significant time to mastering Hard problems and less common algorithmic patterns.

Ultimately, a strong candidate for Google will likely cover the TCS-relevant material through their study, but the reverse is not necessarily true. Building from the ground up is the most reliable path.
