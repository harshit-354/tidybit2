When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both TikTok and DoorDash present distinct interview landscapes shaped by their core business models—social media and content delivery versus logistics and real-time dispatch. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of publicly reported questions. TikTok's list, at 383 questions, dwarfs DoorDash's 87. This volume suggests a more extensive and possibly more rapidly evolving question bank at TikTok, likely due to its larger applicant pool and intense competition for roles.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring bars:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The profile is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty (260 questions, ~68%), with a significant number of **Hard** questions (81, ~21%). This indicates a strong emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving under pressure, where optimal solutions are often required.
- **DoorDash (E6/M51/H30):** While also Medium-heavy (51 questions, ~59%), the proportion of **Hard** questions is slightly lower (30, ~34%). The notably small number of **Easy** questions for both companies confirms that interviews are designed to be challenging from the start.

In essence, TikTok's interview appears more saturated with complex problems, while DoorDash maintains a high bar with a slightly more concentrated set of challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize core data structures, but with nuances in application.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are fundamental for both. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures, performing efficient lookups, and implementing two-pointer or sliding window techniques.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common two-pointer pattern for arrays/strings
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: A common two-pointer pattern for arrays/strings
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common two-pointer pattern for arrays/strings
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Distinct Emphases:**

- **TikTok** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with complex optimization problems in feed ranking, video processing, or resource allocation. Expect problems involving memoization or tabulation.
- **DoorDash** uniquely highlights **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This is critical for modeling real-world logistics scenarios like route exploration, mapping delivery networks, or traversing menu/item hierarchies. Graph and tree traversal are key.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS pattern crucial for DoorDash (graph traversal)
def dfs(node, visited, graph):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS pattern crucial for DoorDash (graph traversal)
function dfs(node, visited, graph) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfs(neighbor, visited, graph);
  }
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS pattern crucial for DoorDash (graph traversal)
public void dfs(Node node, Set<Node> visited, Map<Node, List<Node>> graph) {
    if (visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    for (Node neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        dfs(neighbor, visited, graph);
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your target companies and timeline.

1.  **Prepare for DoorDash First if:** You are interviewing with them sooner, or you want to build confidence with a slightly more focused (though still difficult) question set. Mastering the core topics plus DFS will give you strong coverage. The smaller question bank allows for more complete, repeated practice.

2.  **Prepare for TikTok First if:** Your primary goal is a TikTok role, or you want to tackle the broader, more DP-intensive challenge head-on. Succeeding here will mean you are exceptionally well-drilled on a wide range of Medium and Hard problems, which will also make you very competitive for DoorDash interviews. However, you must allocate significantly more time for comprehensive practice.

A universal strategy is to **master the shared foundation first**: Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and common algorithms (sorting, searching, two-pointer). Then, branch into company-specific deep dives: DP for TikTok, and DFS/Graph for DoorDash. Regardless of the order, practice articulating your thought process clearly, as both companies evaluate communication and problem-solving approach alongside raw coding skill.
