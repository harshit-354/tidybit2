When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Infosys and Snapchat represent two distinct ends of the spectrum: a global IT services giant and a fast-paced social media tech company. Their interview questions reflect their core business needs—Infosys emphasizes foundational problem-solving for large-scale projects, while Snapchat tests for efficient, real-time system thinking. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in volume and the profile of easy questions.

- **Infosys (158 questions)**: With nearly 60% more questions than Snapchat, Infosys's list is broad. The difficulty distribution (42 Easy, 82 Medium, 34 Hard) indicates a strong emphasis on **Medium-level problems**. This large, medium-heavy pool suggests they test for consistent, competent application of standard algorithms across many problem types, which is typical for companies dealing with diverse enterprise projects.

- **Snapchat (99 questions)**: The list is more curated. The striking detail is the low number of **Easy questions (only 6)**, with the vast majority being Medium (62) and Hard (31). This skew indicates Snapchat's interviews are designed to quickly filter for candidates who can handle complex problem-solving under pressure, aligning with the performance demands of a consumer-facing app.

In short, Infosys tests for breadth and solid fundamentals, while Snapchat tests for depth and the ability to tackle challenging problems from the start.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are fundamental to most coding problems. Beyond that, their focus diverges, revealing their engineering priorities.

- **Infosys's Additional Focus**: **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Math**. DP questions are classic for testing optimized, recursive problem-solving—a key skill for efficient large-scale systems. Math problems assess logical and analytical thinking. This combination points to an interview that values algorithmic optimization and strong analytical fundamentals.

- **Snapchat's Additional Focus**: **Hash Table** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Heavy use of Hash Tables is essential for achieving O(1) lookups, critical in real-time features like messaging and story feeds. BFS is the go-to algorithm for finding shortest paths or levels, directly applicable to features like friend connections or discovering content. This toolkit is highly practical for building responsive, graph-like social features.

Here’s a typical problem illustrating the difference in focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Infosys-style: Dynamic Programming/Math focus
# Problem: Count ways to reach the nth stair (can take 1 or 2 steps)
def climb_stairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Snapchat-style: Hash Table/BFS focus
// Problem: Find the shortest path in a social network (graph).
function shortestPathBFS(graph, start, end) {
  const queue = [[start]];
  const visited = new Set([start]);

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const path = queue.shift();
    const node = path[path.length - 1];

    if (node === end) return path;

    for (const neighbor of graph[node] || []) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        visited.add(neighbor);
        queue.push([...path, neighbor]);
      }
    }
  }
  return null; // No path found
}
```

```java
// Infosys-style: Dynamic Programming/Math focus
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Snapchat-style: Hash Table/BFS focus
public List<String> shortestPathBFS(Map<String, List<String>> graph, String start, String end) {
    Queue<List<String>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
    queue.offer(Arrays.asList(start));
    visited.add(start);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        List<String> path = queue.poll();
        String node = path.get(path.size() - 1);
        if (node.equals(end)) return path;

        for (String neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
            if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                visited.add(neighbor);
                List<String> newPath = new ArrayList<>(path);
                newPath.add(neighbor);
                queue.offer(newPath);
            }
        }
    }
    return null; // No path found
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target role and current skill level.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey. The larger volume of questions, higher count of Easy problems, and focus on foundational topics like Arrays, Strings, DP, and Math provide a comprehensive **grounding in core algorithms**. Mastering this list will build a strong base that is transferable to almost any other technical interview, including Snapchat's.

**Prepare for Snapchat first if:** You are already comfortable with core data structures and are targeting roles in product-driven tech companies. Diving into their Medium- and Hard-heavy list will sharpen your skills under more realistic, high-pressure conditions. The intense focus on Hash Tables and BFS will force you to master the efficient, practical algorithms crucial for real-time systems.

Regardless of your target, a solid strategy is to master the shared **Array and String** fundamentals, then branch out into Infosys's **DP/Math** problems for algorithmic depth, followed by Snapchat's **Hash Table and BFS** problems for applied, performance-critical coding.
