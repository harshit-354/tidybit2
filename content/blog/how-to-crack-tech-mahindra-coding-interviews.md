Tech Mahindra’s coding interviews are a critical gateway for software engineering roles. The process typically involves an initial online assessment followed by technical interviews that focus heavily on problem-solving with code. The questions test fundamental programming logic, data structure knowledge, and the ability to write clean, efficient solutions under time constraints. Understanding the specific pattern of their assessments is the first step to cracking them.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Tech Mahindra coding problems reveals a clear pattern: **60% Medium** and **40% Easy** difficulty, with **0% Hard** questions. This distribution is your strategic advantage. It means the interview is designed to assess solid foundational skills and logical reasoning, not obscure algorithmic mastery. You won't need to grind complex graph algorithms or advanced dynamic programming. Instead, you must be flawless on fundamentals. The goal is to solve all Easy questions quickly and correctly, leaving ample time to tackle the Medium problems, which are the real differentiators. Missing an Easy question due to a careless bug can be more costly than failing to optimize a Medium one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Master these, and you'll cover the vast majority of the testable material.

- **Array:** The most frequent data structure. Expect problems involving traversal, searching, sorting, and subarray calculations.
- **Math:** Problems often involve number properties, digit manipulation, basic arithmetic series, or simple combinatorics.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A key topic for Medium problems. You'll frequently see classic patterns like finding maximum/minimum sums or counts.
- **Hash Table:** Essential for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often used in tandem with Array problems to find pairs or track frequencies.
- **Enumeration:** This involves systematically iterating through all possibilities, often within a constrained range, to find a valid answer.

The most important pattern to master is **Dynamic Programming on Arrays**, as it combines two top topics. A classic example is the "Maximum Subarray Sum" (Kadane's Algorithm). Here’s how to implement it:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSubarraySum(nums) {
  let currentSum = nums[0];
  let maxSum = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int currentSum = nums[0];
    int maxSum = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-by-topic approach is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this period to **Arrays** and **Hash Tables**. Solve 15-20 problems on array manipulation, two-pointer techniques, and sliding window. Use hash tables to solve problems like "Two Sum" and "First Repeating Element." Ensure you can implement these structures and their basic operations from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Logic.** Tackle **Math** and **Enumeration** problems. Practice digit extraction, prime checks, and basic GCD/LCM. For enumeration, work on problems where brute-force iteration is acceptable, focusing on writing clean, bug-free loops. This is also the time to start **Dynamic Programming**. Begin with the fundamental 1D DP problems like Fibonacci, climbing stairs, and the maximum subarray sum shown above.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Testing.** Shift to solving mixed-topic Medium-difficulty problems. Simulate the actual test environment: set a 45-minute timer for solving 2-3 problems. Focus intensely on problems that combine topics, like using a hash table to optimize an array search or applying DP to an enumeration problem. In the final week, review all your previous code and re-solve problems you found tricky the first time.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** For Easy problems, a straightforward, readable solution is always better than a complex, optimized one. Get the points first. You can often return to optimize if time remains.
2.  **Write Pseudocode First.** Before typing any code, spend 2-3 minutes writing step-by-step logic on paper or in a comment. This prevents logical dead-ends and results in cleaner, more structured code, which interviewers notice.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before submitting, manually test your code with at least three cases: a simple typical input, a minimal input (empty array, single element), and a large or tricky edge case (all negative numbers for the max subarray problem). This catches most common bugs.
4.  **Manage Your Time by Difficulty.** If you hit a mental block on a Medium problem after 10-12 minutes, skip it. Solve another Easy or a different Medium problem first. This ensures you collect all available points and often provides a fresh perspective when you return to the skipped problem.

Success in the Tech Mahindra coding round is a matter of focused preparation on high-probability topics and disciplined execution during the test. Master the fundamentals, practice under timed conditions, and you'll be well-positioned to pass.
