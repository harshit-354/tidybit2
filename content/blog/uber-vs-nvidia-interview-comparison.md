When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Uber and NVIDIA, while both leaders in their respective industries, present distinct interview landscapes due to their different core businesses—transportation/logistics versus graphics/AI hardware and software. This comparison analyzes their question profiles on TidyBit to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a significant difference in both the number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

**Uber** has a larger, more challenging overall question bank with **381 questions**. The difficulty breakdown is:

- **Easy**: 54 questions (~14%)
- **Medium**: 224 questions (~59%)
- **Hard**: 103 questions (~27%)

This profile suggests Uber's interviews heavily emphasize medium-difficulty problems, with a substantial portion of hard questions. The high volume indicates a broad set of potential problems, requiring candidates to be well-versed in applying core algorithms to complex, real-world scenarios, likely related to routing, matching, or large-scale systems.

**NVIDIA** has a smaller, more moderate question bank of **137 questions**. The difficulty breakdown is:

- **Easy**: 34 questions (~25%)
- **Medium**: 89 questions (~65%)
- **Hard**: 14 questions (~10%)

NVIDIA's focus is clearly on medium-difficulty questions, with a much smaller proportion of hard problems. The lower total volume might indicate a more focused set of core concepts, but the high percentage of medium questions means you must solve non-trivial problems efficiently.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with subtle differences in priority.

The top topics are nearly identical: **Array, String, Hash Table**. This underscores the universal importance of mastering these fundamentals. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays and strings and leveraging hash tables for O(1) lookups.

**Key Preparation Takeaway:** For both companies, deep mastery of these three topics is non-negotiable. Expect problems involving sliding windows, two-pointers on arrays/strings, and using hash maps for frequency counting or memoization.

```python
# Example: Hash Table for frequency (common to both)
def find_anagram_indices(s, p):
    p_count = {}
    window_count = {}
    for char in p:
        p_count[char] = p_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    result = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Add new char to window
        window_count[s[i]] = window_count.get(s[i], 0) + 1
        # Remove old char from window
        if i >= len(p):
            left_char = s[i - len(p)]
            if window_count[left_char] == 1:
                del window_count[left_char]
            else:
                window_count[left_char] -= 1
        # Compare window to pattern
        if window_count == p_count:
            result.append(i - len(p) + 1)
    return result
```

```javascript
// Example: Hash Table for frequency (common to both)
function findAnagramIndices(s, p) {
  const pCount = new Map();
  const windowCount = new Map();
  for (const char of p) {
    pCount.set(char, (pCount.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }

  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    // Add new char to window
    windowCount.set(s[i], (windowCount.get(s[i]) || 0) + 1);
    // Remove old char from window
    if (i >= p.length) {
      const leftChar = s[i - p.length];
      if (windowCount.get(leftChar) === 1) {
        windowCount.delete(leftChar);
      } else {
        windowCount.set(leftChar, windowCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
      }
    }
    // Compare window to pattern
    if (mapsEqual(windowCount, pCount)) {
      result.push(i - p.length + 1);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

function mapsEqual(map1, map2) {
  if (map1.size !== map2.size) return false;
  for (const [key, val] of map1) {
    if (map2.get(key) !== val) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: Hash Table for frequency (common to both)
import java.util.*;

public List<Integer> findAnagramIndices(String s, String p) {
    Map<Character, Integer> pCount = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> windowCount = new HashMap<>();
    for (char c : p.toCharArray()) {
        pCount.put(c, pCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }

    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        // Add new char to window
        char current = s.charAt(i);
        windowCount.put(current, windowCount.getOrDefault(current, 0) + 1);
        // Remove old char from window
        if (i >= p.length()) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(i - p.length());
            if (windowCount.get(leftChar) == 1) {
                windowCount.remove(leftChar);
            } else {
                windowCount.put(leftChar, windowCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            }
        }
        // Compare window to pattern
        if (windowCount.equals(pCount)) {
            result.add(i - p.length() + 1);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Divergence:** Uber's list includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic, which is absent from NVIDIA's top list. This implies Uber interviews are more likely to include complex optimization problems (e.g., "edit distance", "knapsack" variants) that require DP. NVIDIA includes **Sorting**, highlighting the need for efficient data organization, which is critical in graphics and parallel computing contexts.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target role and timeline.

If your goal is a **general software engineering role** and you are early in your interview preparation cycle, **start with NVIDIA's profile**. Its focused question set and lower proportion of hard problems allow you to solidify core competencies in Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Mastering these will build a strong foundation for any interview. The emphasis on Sorting is also a fundamental algorithmic skill.

**Prioritize Uber's profile** if you are targeting roles involving optimization, distributed systems, or if you are in later-stage preparation. The high volume and difficulty, especially the prevalence of Dynamic Programming questions, demand more dedicated, advanced practice. Preparing for Uber will inherently cover the fundamentals emphasized by NVIDIA, but the reverse is not as true—you would need additional, focused DP practice.

In practice, a strong candidate will master the shared fundamentals first. Then, tailor deeper study based on the company: drill DP problems for Uber, and ensure you can implement and analyze efficient sorting routines for NVIDIA.
