When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer can dramatically improve your odds of success. Walmart Labs and ServiceNow are both prominent names, but their interview processes, as reflected in their question banks, have distinct characteristics. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer volume of questions. Walmart Labs has a significantly larger pool, with **152 questions** cataloged, compared to ServiceNow's **78 questions**. This suggests that Walmart Labs interviews may draw from a broader set of problems or that their process has been documented more extensively over time.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Walmart Labs (E22/M105/H25):** The focus is overwhelmingly on **Medium difficulty** questions, which comprise about 69% of their catalog. This aligns with the standard for software engineering roles at large tech companies, where interviews are designed to assess problem-solving and implementation under pressure. The presence of 25 Hard questions indicates you must be prepared for complex optimization challenges, especially for senior roles.
- **ServiceNow (E8/M58/H12):** Similarly, the emphasis is on **Medium difficulty** problems, making up roughly 74% of their questions. However, the total count in each category is lower. The smaller number of Easy and Hard questions suggests a slightly more concentrated focus on core, practical problem-solving skills rather than extreme fundamentals or highly advanced algorithms.

In essence, both companies center their interviews on Medium-level challenges, but preparing for Walmart Labs requires covering a wider array of such problems.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the difference in volume, there is near-perfect alignment in the top four technical topics for both companies: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**.

This overlap is critical for your study plan. Mastering these areas will build a strong foundation for interviews at either company.

- **Array and String** manipulation is fundamental, often serving as the basis for questions involving two-pointers, sliding windows, or sorting.
- **Hash Table** usage is ubiquitous for optimizing lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, duplicates, or complementary sums.
- **Dynamic Programming** appears as a key differentiator for harder problems, testing your ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

A question involving a hash table and sliding window, common to both companies, might look like this:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray_length(nums, k):
    freq = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        freq[nums[right]] = freq.get(nums[right], 0) + 1
        while freq[nums[right]] > k:
            freq[nums[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function maxSubarrayLength(nums, k) {
    const freq = new Map();
    let left = 0;
    let maxLen = 0;
    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        freq.set(nums[right], (freq.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
        while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
            freq.set(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]]) - 1);
            left++;
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        freq.put(nums[right], freq.getOrDefault(nums[right], 0) + 1);
        while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
            freq.put(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]) - 1);
            left++;
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the significant topic overlap, you can efficiently prepare for both companies simultaneously. **Start with ServiceNow's question list.** Its smaller, more concentrated set of primarily Medium-difficulty problems on core topics provides an excellent and manageable foundation. Solving these will solidify your understanding of the patterns that are absolutely essential for both interviews.

Once comfortable, **expand your preparation to the Walmart Labs question bank.** This will expose you to a greater variety of problem scenarios and the tougher Hard questions you might encounter. Think of ServiceNow's list as your core training and Walmart Labs' as the advanced broadening and reinforcement.

Ultimately, a candidate well-prepared for Walmart Labs will likely cover most, if not all, of the ground needed for ServiceNow. The reverse is less true due to the volume and difficulty gap. Prioritize depth on the shared fundamental topics, then build breadth and tackle higher difficulty.
