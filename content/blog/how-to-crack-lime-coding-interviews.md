Lime’s technical interview process is designed to assess how you solve real-world engineering problems. Candidates typically face a series of coding interviews focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, system design, and behavioral questions. The coding portion is critical, and the question profile reveals a clear pattern of what to expect.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Lime's coding interview questions break down as follows:

- **Easy:** 1 question (14%)
- **Medium:** 5 questions (71%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (14%)

This distribution is telling. The overwhelming majority of your preparation should be dedicated to **Medium-difficulty problems**. These questions test your ability to apply core algorithms and data structures to non-trivial scenarios, often with a twist. The single Hard question is your differentiator; it’s where you demonstrate deep problem-solving under pressure. Don't neglect Easy problems, as they often form the foundation for more complex variations. The goal is to master Mediums so thoroughly that you can efficiently tackle the Hard problem with remaining time and mental energy.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics in Lime interviews are **Array, Depth-First Search (DFS), Sorting, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**. Here’s how to approach each.

**Array:** Expect manipulations involving subarrays, in-place operations, and two-pointer techniques. Master sliding window and prefix sum patterns.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS):** These are staples for graph and tree traversal. DFS is often used for pathfinding, connectivity, and permutation problems. BFS is key for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and level-order traversals. Know both recursive and iterative implementations.

**Sorting:** It’s rarely just about calling `.sort()`. You need to understand how sorting enables other algorithms (like two-pointer) or how to implement custom comparators for complex objects.

**Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):** This is a critical data structure for dynamic connectivity problems, frequently appearing in questions about networks, grids, or merging groups. If you see a problem about "connecting" or "determining if two elements are in the same group," think Union-Find.

The most important pattern from this set is **Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)**, as it's fundamental to solving a wide range of problems. Here is a template for performing a DFS on a grid, a common scenario:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dfs_grid(grid, r, c):
    # Check boundaries and validity (e.g., land vs. water)
    if (r < 0 or r >= len(grid) or
        c < 0 or c >= len(grid[0]) or
        grid[r][c] != 1):
        return

    # Mark as visited
    grid[r][c] = 0

    # Explore all four directions
    directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        dfs_grid(grid, r + dr, c + dc)
```

```javascript
function dfsGrid(grid, r, c) {
  // Check boundaries and validity
  if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] !== 1) {
    return;
  }

  // Mark as visited
  grid[r][c] = 0;

  // Explore all four directions
  const directions = [
    [1, 0],
    [-1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
  ];
  for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
    dfsGrid(grid, r + dr, c + dc);
  }
}
```

```java
public void dfsGrid(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    // Check boundaries and validity
    if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length ||
        c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length ||
        grid[r][c] != 1) {
        return;
    }

    // Mark as visited
    grid[r][c] = 0;

    // Explore all four directions
    int[][] directions = {{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};
    for (int[] dir : directions) {
        dfsGrid(grid, r + dir[0], c + dir[1]);
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Systematically review core data structures: Arrays, Hash Maps, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, and Trees. Practice implementing DFS, BFS, and Union-Find from scratch. Solve 1-2 problems per topic, focusing on understanding, not speed.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Topics & Patterns.** Dedicate blocks of time to Lime's top topics. For each topic (e.g., Arrays), study the key patterns (two-pointer, sliding window). Then, solve 5-8 Medium-difficulty problems specifically for that topic. Use platforms that allow you to filter by company and difficulty.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Stop topic-specific studying. Start doing mixed-topic problem sets under timed conditions (45-60 minutes). Simulate the actual interview: state your approach, write clean code, and test with edge cases. Complete at least 3-5 full mock interviews with a peer or mentor. In the final days, review your notes on patterns and common pitfalls.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, time/space complexity, and consider edge cases. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving journey, not just the final output.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one you can't implement. Start with a clear, working solution, then optimize if time permits.
3.  **Practice Writing on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** You likely won't have IDE auto-completion. Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code and pseudocode by hand or in a minimal editor.
4.  **Memorize Union-Find.** It's a compact algorithm that's easy to forget under pressure. Be able to write the `find` and `union` operations with path compression and union by rank in your sleep.
5.  **Test with Small Cases.** After coding, walk through your logic with a small, custom test case. This often reveals off-by-one errors or incorrect assumptions.

Mastering these patterns and executing a disciplined study plan will position you to handle Lime's focus on medium-difficulty, graph, and array-based problems effectively.
