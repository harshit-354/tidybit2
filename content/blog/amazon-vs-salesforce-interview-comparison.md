When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically improve your efficiency. Amazon and Salesforce both test core computer science fundamentals, but their approach to interview questions differs significantly in volume, difficulty distribution, and emphasis. A strategic candidate will tailor their preparation to these differences rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question pools and their difficulty breakdown.

**Amazon** maintains a massive repository of **1,938 questions**, making it one of the largest among tech companies. The difficulty distribution is relatively balanced but leans towards medium-level problems:

- **Easy:** 530 questions (27%)
- **Medium:** 1,057 questions (55%)
- **Hard:** 351 questions (18%)

This volume means you cannot realistically "grind" the entire list. Success requires identifying and mastering high-frequency patterns and the company's leadership principles, which are often evaluated through behavioral questions intertwined with technical discussions.

**Salesforce**, in contrast, has a much more focused question bank of **189 questions**. Its distribution is heavily skewed towards medium-difficulty problems:

- **Easy:** 27 questions (14%)
- **Medium:** 113 questions (60%)
- **Hard:** 49 questions (26%)

While smaller, the list is highly concentrated. Mastering Salesforce's question pool is a more feasible goal, but the higher proportion of medium and hard questions (86% combined) indicates a strong emphasis on problem-solving depth over breadth.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies test a nearly identical set of core data structures and algorithms, which is excellent news for your preparation efficiency.

The top topics for both are:

1.  **Array** and **String** manipulation
2.  **Hash Table** usage for efficient lookups
3.  **Dynamic Programming** for optimization problems

This overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both interviews. However, the application may differ. Amazon's vast question set often presents these concepts in the context of large-scale system design or data processing scenarios. Salesforce's questions, while still algorithmic, may more frequently relate to data transformation, business logic, or working with structured records.

For example, a problem involving merging intervals or finding substrings could appear at either company, but the framing might differ.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common overlapping pattern - Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common overlapping pattern - Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common overlapping pattern - Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by the principle of **foundation first, then specialization**.

1.  **Start with the Common Foundation.** Begin by mastering the overlapping core topics: Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Dynamic Programming. Use general problem lists (like "Top 100 Liked" on LeetCode) to build competency. This core knowledge is directly applicable to both companies.

2.  **Prepare for Salesforce First (if interviewing for both).** Given its smaller, more concentrated question bank, you can efficiently target Salesforce's specific problems. Achieving coverage and depth here is a manageable medium-term goal. The high concentration of medium-difficulty problems is ideal for solidifying your core algorithmic skills.

3.  **Then, Tackle Amazon's Patterns.** After securing the core foundation (reinforced by Salesforce prep), transition to Amazon's list. Do not attempt to solve all 1,900+ questions. Instead, focus on **high-frequency questions** and recognize patterns. Pay equal attention to behavioral preparation using the Leadership Principles, as these are integral to Amazon's process. Your solidified core skills will allow you to adapt to Amazon's wider variety of problems more effectively.

This approach builds a strong, versatile foundation before scaling up to the more extensive and varied challenge of Amazon's interview loop.
