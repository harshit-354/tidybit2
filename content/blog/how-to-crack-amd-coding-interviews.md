AMD’s coding interviews are a direct test of your fundamental problem-solving skills. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via a shared code editor. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication. While the problems are not designed to be obscure, they require a strong grasp of core data structures and the ability to implement solutions under time pressure. Success hinges on systematic preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent patterns, the difficulty distribution is clear: **33% Easy, 67% Medium, 0% Hard**. This breakdown is highly informative for your preparation strategy.

The complete absence of "Hard" problems means you likely won't encounter complex dynamic programming with multiple states or advanced graph algorithms like max-flow. Instead, the interview is designed to assess competency, not genius. The 67% Medium problems form the core of the challenge. These questions require you to combine 2-3 core concepts to arrive at an optimal solution. You must move beyond brute force and demonstrate knowledge of efficient patterns. The 33% Easy questions serve as warm-ups or checks for basic coding fluency—fumbling here creates a poor first impression. In short, your goal is to master Medium-difficulty problems across the key topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a strong focus on foundational topics. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **Array:** The most frequent data structure. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations.
- **Hash Table:** The essential tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, memoization, and mapping relationships.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, modular arithmetic, or simple simulations. Often tests logical thinking more than complex algorithms.
- **Sorting:** Sometimes the goal, but more often a crucial preprocessing step that enables a simpler two-pointer or greedy solution.
- **String:** Closely related to Array problems, often involving character manipulation, palindromes, or encoding/decoding patterns.

A dominant pattern that combines **Array** and **Hash Table** is the "Two-Sum" family of problems, which is fundamental for achieving O(n) time complexity for finding pairs or subarrays that meet a target condition.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: Find indices of two numbers that add to target.
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Find indices of two numbers that add to target.
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than sporadic cramming.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building**

- Days 1-7: Deeply study **Array** and **Hash Table**. Solve 10-15 problems for each topic, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Internalize the two-sum pattern, sliding window, and prefix sum.
- Days 8-14: Master **String** and **Sorting**. Practice problems that involve sorting as a first step. Implement common sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) once for understanding.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Integration & Practice**

- Focus exclusively on **Medium** difficulty problems. Each day, pick a problem that combines topics (e.g., an Array problem that requires a Hash Table for efficiency).
- Start timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem). Write code on a whiteboard or in a plain text editor to simulate the interview environment.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Conduct at least 4-6 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Use actual AMD problems or similar Medium-level questions.
- Practice verbalizing your thought process aloud from the moment you read the problem. This is non-negotiable.
- Review your weak spots. If Math problems trip you up, dedicate a day to number theory and simulation patterns.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a single line of code, restate the problem, confirm edge cases, and outline your approach. Narrate your thinking as you code. Silence is your enemy.
2.  **Optimize with a Hash Map.** When you see a problem involving finding a pair, checking for duplicates, or needing O(1) access, your first thought should be "Can a hash table solve this?"
3.  **Don't Ignore Easy Problems.** Practice them to build speed and accuracy. In an interview, solve them flawlessly and quickly to build confidence and save time for the Medium challenge.
4.  **Test Your Own Code.** Always run through 2-3 test cases, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Verbally state what you're testing and why.

Mastering these core patterns and practicing under realistic conditions is the most reliable way to pass the AMD coding screen. Your goal is to demonstrate consistent, methodical skill, not flashy brilliance.
