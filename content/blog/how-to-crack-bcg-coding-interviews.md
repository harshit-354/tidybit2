BCG’s technical interviews are designed to assess your problem-solving speed, clarity of thought, and coding fluency under pressure. While not as algorithmically intense as pure tech giants, they demand a practical, efficient approach to common computational problems. Success hinges on recognizing patterns quickly and writing clean, bug-free code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The typical BCG coding question set leans heavily toward solvable problems within a 30-45 minute interview slot. Based on an analysis of recent patterns, the distribution is approximately:

- **Easy (30%):** 3 questions. These test fundamental programming skills and logical thinking. They are warm-ups or quick wins; failing here is a major red flag.
- **Medium (50%):** 5 questions. This is the core of the interview. You must demonstrate mastery of core data structures (arrays, strings, hash maps) and common algorithms (sorting, two-pointer, basic simulation).
- **Hard (20%):** 2 questions. These are less common but test your ability to handle complexity, often involving multi-step logic, optimization, or less intuitive applications of standard patterns.

This breakdown signals that **breadth and consistency are more critical than extreme depth**. Your goal is to reliably solve all Easy and Medium problems. The "Hard" questions often resemble tougher Medium problems from platforms like LeetCode.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Concentrate your study on these high-frequency areas. The key is not just knowing the topic, but knowing the _pattern_ to apply.

1.  **Array & String Manipulation:** The absolute cornerstone. Expect operations like searching, filtering, transforming, and comparing sequences.
2.  **Simulation:** Directly modeling a described process step-by-step. Tests your ability to translate written rules into robust, edge-case-handling code.
3.  **Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or basic combinatorics. Efficiency is usually achieved through mathematical insight, not brute force.
4.  **Sorting:** Rarely just calling `sort()`. It's about using sorting as a pre-processing step to enable another algorithm (like two-pointer or greedy approach).

The most critical pattern across these topics is the **Two-Pointer Technique**, especially for array and string problems. It provides an O(n) time and O(1) space solution to problems that might seem to require O(n²) brute force.

```python
# Example: Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write_pointer = 1
    for read_pointer in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read_pointer] != nums[read_pointer - 1]:
            nums[write_pointer] = nums[read_pointer]
            write_pointer += 1
    return write_pointer  # New length

# nums = [1,1,2,2,3] -> function returns 3, nums becomes [1,2,3,_,_]
```

```javascript
// Example: Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let writePointer = 1;
  for (let readPointer = 1; readPointer < nums.length; readPointer++) {
    if (nums[readPointer] !== nums[readPointer - 1]) {
      nums[writePointer] = nums[readPointer];
      writePointer++;
    }
  }
  return writePointer; // New length
}
// nums = [1,1,2,2,3] -> function returns 3, nums becomes [1,2,3,_,_]
```

```java
// Example: Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int writePointer = 1;
    for (int readPointer = 1; readPointer < nums.length; readPointer++) {
        if (nums[readPointer] != nums[readPointer - 1]) {
            nums[writePointer] = nums[readPointer];
            writePointer++;
        }
    }
    return writePointer; // New length
}
// nums = [1,1,2,2,3] -> function returns 3, nums becomes [1,2,3,_,_]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition**

- Focus exclusively on **Easy** and **Medium** problems from the core topics (Array, String, Simulation).
- Learn 5-7 core patterns: Two-Pointer, Sliding Window, Hash Map for lookups, Simulation loops, and basic Sorting applications.
- Solve 2-3 problems daily. For each, spend 15 minutes trying independently, then study the optimal solution if stuck. Internalize the pattern.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Depth & Speed**

- Dive deeper into each topic. For example, under "Array," practice sub-areas like rotation, partitioning, and prefix sums.
- Start timing yourself. Aim for 15-20 minutes to understand, design, code, and test a Medium problem.
- Begin mixing in occasional **Hard** problems that are extensions of known patterns (e.g., a complex simulation).

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Repair**

- Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a timer and a vocal explanation of your thought process.
- Revisit previously solved problems to ensure you can code them flawlessly from scratch.
- Isolate your weak topics and do a concentrated burst of 5-10 problems in that area.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Before writing a single line, verbally outline your approach. State the pattern you're using, the time/space complexity, and mention one or two edge cases. This aligns you with the interviewer.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one full of bugs. Get a working solution first, then optimize if time permits. BCG values logical, maintainable code.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Explicitly:** After coding, don't just say "it looks right." Walk through a small normal case, then an empty input, a single-element input, and a large or sorted/reversed edge case. This demonstrates professional habits.
4.  **Know Your Language's Standard Library:** Be fluent in the utilities for your chosen language (e.g., Python's `collections.Counter`, JavaScript's array methods, Java's `Arrays.sort()` and `HashMap`). This lets you write concise, efficient code quickly.

Mastering these patterns and executing this focused plan will transform the BCG coding interview from a challenge into a demonstration of your structured problem-solving ability.
