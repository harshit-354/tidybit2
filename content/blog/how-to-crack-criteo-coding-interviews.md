Cracking Criteo's coding interviews requires a focused, efficient approach. Their process typically involves a recruiter screen, one or two technical phone/video interviews focusing on data structures and algorithms, and an on-site or virtual final round with similar coding challenges and system design discussions. The key is to master the specific patterns they consistently test.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear and candidate-friendly pattern: **67% Easy and 33% Medium questions, with 0% Hard**. This breakdown is significant. It means Criteo's coding interviews are designed to assess strong foundational competency and clean coding habits, rather than demanding obscure algorithmic tricks. You will not face "gotcha" problems. Instead, you'll encounter questions that test your ability to correctly and efficiently implement standard solutions. The absence of Hard questions suggests the evaluation criteria lean heavily towards clarity, communication, and bug-free code under the core topics. Your goal is to solve the Easy problems flawlessly and quickly, leaving ample time to reason through and implement the Medium problems with confidence.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward these five areas, which constitute the vast majority of their question pool.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place manipulation, and subarray problems.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often paired with Array problems. Mastering the "complement lookup" pattern is non-negotiable.
- **Binary Search:** Applied not just on sorted arrays, but also in problems involving searching for a specific condition or optimal value within a bounded range.
- **Two Pointers:** An essential technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or sequences with linear time, often related to pairing, sliding windows, or in-place operations.
- **Sorting:** Frequently a prerequisite step to enable other techniques like Two Pointers or Binary Search. Know the time/space complexities of standard sorts.

The most critical pattern to master is the **Hash Table complement lookup**, frequently used in Array problems like "Two Sum." Here is the canonical implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # or raise exception
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // or throw error
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{}; // or throw exception
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, etc.), solve 10-15 curated problems on a platform like TidyBit, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just memorizing solutions. Implement every solution in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews.** Start mixing problems from different topics. Practice problems where you must combine techniques, like using Sorting + Two Pointers, or Array + Hash Table + Binary Search. Begin doing timed practice sessions. In the final days of this block, take 2-3 full mock interviews, simulating the 45-60 minute format with a friend or using a recorded session.

**Weeks 5-6: Criteo-Specific Drill & Polish.** Use the final stretch to target Criteo's question bank specifically. Solve all available tagged problems. Re-practice any pattern you feel shaky on. Sharpen your communication: practice explaining your thought process out loud for every problem you solve, from brute force to optimal solution.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity Over Premature Optimization.** Given the high percentage of Easy questions, a correct, readable O(n²) solution is often better than a buggy, rushed O(n) one. Start with a clear brute force, then optimize.
2.  **Communicate Your Process Relentlessly.** Talk through your reasoning, edge cases (empty array, duplicates, negative numbers), and trade-offs before writing code. This turns the interview into a collaborative session and demonstrates your problem-solving skills.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases explicitly. Check for off-by-one errors, especially in loops and Binary Search.
4.  **Master Your Chosen Language's Standard Library.** Know the key APIs for your language's Hash Table (dict, Map, HashMap), sorting functions, and utility classes. Wasting time looking up syntax creates a poor impression.

Success at Criteo is about demonstrating consistent, reliable skill in the fundamentals. Target their high-frequency topics, practice communicating your solutions, and you'll be well-prepared for their interview loop.
