Navi’s technical interviews are known for their intense focus on algorithmic problem-solving and efficient code. The process typically involves multiple rounds of coding assessments, often featuring problems that test your ability to optimize for both time and space complexity under pressure. Success hinges on a deep, practical understanding of core data structures and algorithms.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Navi coding questions reveals a clear pattern: **75% Medium and 25% Hard difficulty problems, with no Easy questions**. This distribution is critical. It means Navi’s interviews are designed to filter for candidates who can reliably solve complex, non-trivial problems. You won't encounter simple warm-ups. Every question is intended to push your analytical skills. The absence of Easy problems signals that you must be prepared to tackle optimization challenges and edge cases from the very first interview round. Mastery of Medium problems is the absolute baseline requirement, with a strong likelihood of facing at least one deeply challenging Hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-priority topics. You should drill these until the patterns become second nature.

- **Array:** The foundation for most problems. Expect manipulations, subarray calculations, and in-place operations.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A favorite for Hard problems. You must be proficient in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, often for sequences or partitions.
- **Binary Search:** Not just for sorted arrays. Navi often uses its application in "searching for an answer" in a monotonic function, which is a common pattern in optimization problems.
- **Greedy:** Frequently tested for Medium-difficulty scheduling, interval, or assignment problems. The challenge is proving (or intuitively applying) the correct greedy choice.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step. Understanding the performance implications of your sort and how it enables other algorithms (like two-pointer or greedy approaches) is key.

Given that **Dynamic Programming** is a cornerstone for their hardest problems, internalizing a core pattern like the "House Robber" or "0/1 Knapsack" is essential. Below is a classic DP pattern for finding the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in an array, a fundamental concept that can be adapted to many scenarios.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_non_adjacent_sum(nums):
    """
    Returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.
    Uses O(1) space DP.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0
    prev1, prev2 = 0, 0  # prev1 = dp[i-1], prev2 = dp[i-2]
    for num in nums:
        # At each step: rob current house + dp[i-2] OR skip to dp[i-1]
        current = max(prev2 + num, prev1)
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    return prev1

# Example
print(max_non_adjacent_sum([2, 7, 9, 3, 1]))  # Output: 12 (2 + 9 + 1)
```

```javascript
function maxNonAdjacentSum(nums) {
  /**
   * Returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.
   * Uses O(1) space DP.
   */
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let prev1 = 0,
    prev2 = 0; // prev1 = dp[i-1], prev2 = dp[i-2]
  for (const num of nums) {
    // At each step: take current + dp[i-2] OR skip to dp[i-1]
    const current = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
    prev2 = prev1;
    prev1 = current;
  }
  return prev1;
}

// Example
console.log(maxNonAdjacentSum([2, 7, 9, 3, 1])); // Output: 12
```

```java
public class DPPattern {
    public static int maxNonAdjacentSum(int[] nums) {
        /**
         * Returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.
         * Uses O(1) space DP.
         */
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int prev1 = 0, prev2 = 0; // prev1 = dp[i-1], prev2 = dp[i-2]
        for (int num : nums) {
            // At each step: take current + dp[i-2] OR skip to dp[i-1]
            int current = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return prev1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(maxNonAdjacentSum(new int[]{2, 7, 9, 3, 1})); // Output: 12
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, DP, Binary Search, Greedy, Sorting), solve 15-20 curated Medium problems. Don't just solve—analyze. For every problem, write down the brute force approach, then optimize. Time yourself. The goal is to build pattern recognition.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Integration**
Shift to solving problems where topics combine (e.g., Binary Search on an answer with a Greedy validation function, or DP on arrays). Start mixing in Hard problems, especially focusing on Dynamic Programming variations (DP on strings, DP on grids). Attempt at least 5-8 Hard problems per week.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Navi-Specific Practice**
Simulate the real environment. Do 2-3 timed mock interviews per week, each with 2-3 problems of Medium/Hard difficulty. Use platforms that provide Navi-tagged questions. In this phase, your focus must expand from just solving to _communicating_ your thought process clearly and writing clean, compilable code under time pressure.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second:** Navi evaluates efficiency. Always state the time/space complexity of your brute force idea, then immediately discuss how to optimize. Articulate this before you write a single line of code.
2.  **Master Space-Optimized DP:** Many Hard DP problems at Navi have follow-ups asking for O(1) or O(n) space solutions. Be prepared to reduce your DP table to a few variables, as shown in the code example above.
3.  **Practice Binary Search Variations:** Go beyond standard search. Practice problems where you use binary search to find the minimum or maximum feasible value (the "answer search" pattern). This is a common twist.
4.  **Clarify, Then Confirm:** Before coding, ask clarifying questions about input size, edge cases, and output format. After outlining your algorithm, verbally confirm it with your interviewer. This catches logical errors early.
5.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values) explicitly. Sloppy code, even if correct, is a red flag.

Your preparation should be relentless and focused on depth over breadth. Internalize the patterns, practice under exam conditions, and communicate your reasoning with clarity.
