Nagarro’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving speed and accuracy. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, followed by discussions on system design and your previous experience. Success hinges on clean, efficient code and clear communication. Here’s how to structure your preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: Nagarro’s coding questions are split evenly between Easy and Medium difficulty, with no Hard problems. This 50/50 split (3 Easy, 3 Medium) is critical intelligence. It means the interview is designed to assess fundamental competency and reliable problem-solving under pressure, not to trick you with obscure algorithms.

The absence of Hard questions is a strategic advantage. It signals that depth of core knowledge is more valuable than breadth of advanced topics. You must be flawless on Easy problems—they are free points and establish confidence. The Medium questions are where candidates are separated; they require combining 2-3 core concepts into a single solution. Your goal is to solve all Easy problems instantly and allocate your mental energy to tackling the Medium ones with optimized, bug-free code.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form the essential toolkit for Nagarro interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Hash Table:** The most versatile tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Use it to cache results, count frequencies, or map relationships.
- **String:** Questions often involve parsing, validating, or transforming string data. Know common operations and pattern matching.
- **Sorting:** Frequently a prerequisite step to enable a more efficient main algorithm (like Two Pointers). Understand built-in sorts and their complexities.
- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Most problems are array-based, requiring traversal, searching, or in-place modification.
- **Two Pointers:** A crucial technique for optimizing problems on sorted arrays or strings, often reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

The intersection of **Hash Table** and **Two Pointers** is particularly powerful. A classic pattern is using a hash map to store seen elements while iterating with a pointer to find complements, solving problems like "Two Sum" or finding pairs that satisfy a condition.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash Map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash Map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash Map: value -> index
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
// Example: new Solution().twoSum(new int[]{2,7,11,15}, 9) returns [0, 1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than months of unstructured study.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. For each, learn the theory, then solve 8-10 problems starting with Easy and moving to Medium. Implement every solution in your primary language. Focus on the patterns, not memorization.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Start solving Medium problems that combine topics (e.g., sort an array then use two pointers). Complete 15-20 such problems. In the final week, begin timed mock interviews. Use platforms that provide Nagarro-specific questions or general ones filtered by the identified topics. Practice speaking your logic aloud.

**Weeks 5-6: Revision & Speed**
No new topics. Re-solve all previously attempted problems, focusing on writing correct code on the first try. Time yourself. Aim to solve an Easy problem within 5-7 minutes and a Medium within 15-20 minutes. Polish your resume and prepare concise stories for behavioral questions.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimized one with bugs. State the brute-force approach, then optimize. For Easy problems, a correct O(n²) solution is often acceptable if you note the trade-off.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code:** Always restate the problem in your own words and walk through a small example. Discuss your approach, including time/space complexity, before writing a single line of code. This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Write a clean main function instead of spaghetti code in the global scope.
4.  **Test Your Own Code:** After writing the solution, don't wait for the interviewer. Walk through your code with the example you defined, then with a few edge cases. Verbally confirm the output.

Mastering these core topics and executing a disciplined practice plan will make you a strong candidate. The pattern is clear: focus on fundamentals, communicate clearly, and code reliably.
