When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Apple and DoorDash, while both testing core computer science fundamentals, present distinct challenges in volume, difficulty, and focus. Apple's process is a broad test of algorithmic mastery across a vast question pool, whereas DoorDash's is a more concentrated assessment of practical, system-oriented problem-solving.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is scale. Apple's listed **356 questions** dwarf DoorDash's **87**. This volume indicates Apple's interview process draws from a much larger, well-established repository of problems, making pure "grinding" less predictable. The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** The majority (58%) are Medium difficulty, with a significant number of Easy questions (28%) and a smaller but substantial Hard portion (14%). This suggests a balanced but demanding process where you must reliably solve Medium problems and be prepared for complex challenges.
- **DoorDash (E6/M51/H30):** The focus is heavily on Medium (59%) and Hard (34%) questions, with very few Easy (7%). This points to an interview loop designed to quickly filter for candidates who can handle nuanced, often open-ended problems typical in logistics and platform engineering.

In short, Apple tests breadth and consistent competency, while DoorDash tests depth and higher-order problem-solving under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These form the essential toolkit for data manipulation and are non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiators lie in their secondary focuses:

- **Apple's standout topic is Dynamic Programming (DP).** Its prevalence signifies Apple's interest in evaluating optimization skills, recursive thinking, and the ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems—skills valuable in system efficiency and resource-constrained environments.
- **DoorDash's standout topic is Depth-First Search (DFS).** This aligns with its domain; DFS is fundamental for traversing graphs, trees, and maps. It's critical for problems involving routes, dependencies, hierarchical data, or exploring all possible states (backtracking), which are core to delivery logistics and platform features.

Consider a problem involving paths or states:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# DFS example: Find all paths from source to target.
def allPathsSourceTarget(graph):
    def dfs(node, path):
        if node == len(graph) - 1:
            res.append(path.copy())
            return
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            path.append(neighbor)
            dfs(neighbor, path)
            path.pop()
    res = []
    dfs(0, [0])
    return res
```

```javascript
// DFS example: Find all paths from source to target.
function allPathsSourceTarget(graph) {
  const res = [];
  function dfs(node, path) {
    if (node === graph.length - 1) {
      res.push([...path]);
      return;
    }
    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      path.push(neighbor);
      dfs(neighbor, path);
      path.pop();
    }
  }
  dfs(0, [0]);
  return res;
}
```

```java
// DFS example: Find all paths from source to target.
public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
    List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
    path.add(0);
    dfs(graph, 0, path, res);
    return res;
}
private void dfs(int[][] graph, int node, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> res) {
    if (node == graph.length - 1) {
        res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        return;
    }
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        path.add(neighbor);
        dfs(graph, neighbor, path, res);
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **DoorDash first** if you are early in your interview cycle or targeting companies with a strong domain-specific focus. Its smaller, more difficult question set allows for deeper mastery of core topics (Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings) and graph traversal (DFS/Backtracking). Succeeding here builds confidence for a wide range of other companies.

Prepare for **Apple first** if you are aiming for a broad senior engineering role or are later in your preparation cycle. Tackling Apple's vast question pool requires and builds extensive algorithmic breadth, particularly in Dynamic Programming. The discipline needed to cover its volume will make other company's question lists feel more manageable, but it is a more substantial initial investment.

Regardless of order, master the shared trifecta of Array, String, and Hash Table problems. Then, branch out: drill DFS and graph problems for DoorDash, and dedicate significant time to Dynamic Programming patterns for Apple.
