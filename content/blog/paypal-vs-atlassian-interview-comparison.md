When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. PayPal and Atlassian, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topical emphasis. A strategic candidate analyzes these differences to allocate study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a significant disparity in the number of documented questions. PayPal's list is larger at 106 questions, compared to Atlassian's 62. This suggests PayPal's interview process may draw from a broader, more established question bank, or that its process is more widely documented by candidates.

The difficulty distribution is also telling:

- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The majority of questions (69) are Medium difficulty. With 19 Hard questions, PayPal clearly expects candidates to solve complex algorithmic challenges. The 18 Easy questions often serve as initial screening or warm-up problems.
- **Atlassian (E7/M43/H12):** The pattern is similar but scaled down, with Medium difficulty dominating (43 questions). The counts for Easy (7) and Hard (12) questions are proportionally lower than PayPal's. This indicates Atlassian's technical screen, while still rigorous, may place a slightly stronger relative emphasis on medium-tier problem-solving and system design, with fewer ultra-complex algorithmic hurdles.

In short, preparing for PayPal requires readiness for a high volume of challenging problems, while Atlassian's process, though still demanding, appears more concentrated on the medium-difficulty core.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational data structures and algorithms. The top four topics are identical, just in a slightly different order:

- **PayPal:** Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting
- **Atlassian:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

This high overlap is excellent news for candidates. Mastering these core areas serves as a powerful base for both companies. Problems will often combine these concepts—for example, using a Hash Table to count frequencies for an Array or String problem, often after Sorting.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common problem testing Array + Hash Table
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common problem testing Array + Hash Table
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common problem testing Array + Hash Table
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

Given the identical topic lists, the main differentiator in question content will be the _complexity_ and _scenario_ within these domains. PayPal's Hard questions might involve intricate manipulations of these structures, while Atlassian's may frame them within more concrete product or collaboration contexts.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the shared core: **Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and Sorting**. This common ground is non-negotiable and forms the backbone of most coding interviews.

If you are interviewing with both, or simply using one as practice for the other, **prioritize PayPal's question list**. Here’s why:

1.  **Coverage:** Solving a representative set of PayPal's 106 questions, especially its 19 Hard problems, will inherently cover the depth and breadth needed for Atlassian's 62 questions. The reverse is not as true; focusing only on Atlassian's list may leave you under-prepared for PayPal's toughest problems.
2.  **Difficulty Buffer:** Achieving proficiency with PayPal's expectations creates a difficulty buffer. If you can handle their Hard array and string problems, Atlassian's Medium problems will feel more manageable.
3.  **Efficiency:** This approach is the most time-efficient path to being prepared for both interview loops. Master the larger, more challenging set first, then review Atlassian-specific questions to acclimate to any differences in problem framing or style.

Ultimately, your preparation should be depth-first on the four shared topics, using the larger PayPal problem set as your primary drilling ground to build robust, transferable problem-solving skills.
