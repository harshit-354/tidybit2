When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns matter. Bloomberg and Airbnb represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of question volume and focus, despite sharing some common technical themes. Bloomberg's extensive, broad question bank tests foundational data structure mastery under pressure, while Airbnb's smaller, curated list often emphasizes practical problem-solving and clean code, reflecting its product-centric engineering culture. Your preparation strategy must adapt accordingly.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a clear story. On TidyBit, Bloomberg has **1,173 questions** categorized as Easy (391), Medium (625), and Hard (157). This massive volume indicates a wide-ranging interview process that likely draws from a deep, established pool of problems. The high Medium count suggests the core of their technical screen is solid algorithmic competency and implementation speed across many domains.

In stark contrast, Airbnb lists only **64 questions**: 11 Easy, 34 Medium, and 19 Hard. This smaller, more intense set implies a highly curated interview process. The significant proportion of Hard questions (nearly 30%) points to a focus on complex, multi-step problems that may involve system design elements or intricate optimization.

**Preparation Implication:** For Bloomberg, breadth and repetition are key. You must be able to reliably solve a high volume of Medium problems. For Airbnb, depth is critical; mastering each of their fewer problems, especially the Hards, and understanding their nuances is more valuable than covering vast ground.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These form the essential toolkit for most coding interviews. The key difference lies in the fourth-ranked topic: Bloomberg lists **Math**, while Airbnb lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

Bloomberg's focus on Math aligns with its financial data domain, often involving numerical analysis, probabilities, or calculations. Airbnb's inclusion of DP highlights its preference for optimization problems, such as those related to scheduling, resource allocation, or cost minimization—themes relevant to a marketplace platform.

A typical "overlap" problem might be a string parsing or hash map challenge, but the context may differ.

```python
# Example: A common Two Sum problem (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Two Sum problem (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Two Sum problem (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Bloomberg**. Its enormous question bank is essentially a comprehensive review of core data structures and algorithms (DSA). Mastering a significant portion of Bloomberg's Medium problems will build the speed, accuracy, and breadth required for any technical interview. This foundation will directly apply to the common topics (Array, String, Hash Table) needed for Airbnb.

Once your DSA foundation is solid, pivot to **Airbnb's list**. Treat it as a set of specialized, high-difficulty case studies. Analyze each problem deeply, looking for the "why" behind it—how it might relate to real-world Airbnb scenarios like booking conflicts or pricing models. This two-phase approach ensures you have the robust skillset Bloomberg tests for, refined with the depth and problem-solving mindset Airbnb evaluates.

Focus your final preparation on the target company's specific list, but build your foundation with the broader one.
