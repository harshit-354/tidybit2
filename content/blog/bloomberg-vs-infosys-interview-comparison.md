When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. Bloomberg and Infosys represent two distinct ends of the spectrum: a major financial technology and data company and a global IT services and consulting giant. Their publicly listed interview questions show clear differences in volume, difficulty, and focus, which directly shape how you should prepare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of preparation differs drastically. Bloomberg's list contains **1,173 questions**, dwarfing Infosys's **158**. This volume indicates Bloomberg's process likely draws from a vast, well-documented pool of algorithmic problems, requiring broad and deep practice.

The difficulty distribution, based on community ratings, further highlights their different technical bars:

- **Bloomberg (E391/M625/H157):** The difficulty is weighted towards **Medium** and **Easy** questions, with a significant number of Hard problems. This suggests a strong focus on core algorithmic competency with some challenging problems to differentiate top candidates.
- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The distribution proportionally mirrors Bloomberg's (roughly 1:2:0.5 for E:M:H), but with far fewer total questions. The emphasis is still on Medium-difficulty problems, but the overall scope is narrower.

The takeaway: Preparing for Bloomberg is a marathon of breadth and depth, while Infosys requires focused, efficient study on a more confined set of concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are foundational to most coding assessments. **Math** problems also appear for both, often involving number properties or basic computation.

The key difference lies in their secondary focuses:

- **Bloomberg** heavily features **Hash Table** questions. This aligns with real-time financial data processing, where efficient lookups and data association are critical. You can expect many problems involving mapping, counting, and caching.
- **Infosys** prominently lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This indicates a stronger emphasis on optimization problems and identifying overlapping subproblems, a common theme in complex system design and algorithmic efficiency for large-scale projects.

Here’s a simple example illustrating a common Hash Table pattern for Bloomberg versus a foundational DP pattern for Infosys:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Bloomberg-style Hash Table: Two Sum
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Infosys-style DP: Fibonacci (memoization)
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
// Bloomberg-style Hash Table: Two Sum
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Infosys-style DP: Fibonacci (memoization)
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
// Bloomberg-style Hash Table: Two Sum
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Infosys-style DP: Fibonacci (memoization)
public int fib(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
    if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    int result = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    memo.put(n, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your priority depends on your target and timeline.

**Prepare for Bloomberg first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech or fintech roles and have ample time (2-3 months). Mastering Bloomberg's list will force you to build exceptional breadth and solid problem-solving speed, which will make preparing for Infosys's more focused list feel like a subset review. The depth required for Bloomberg covers the core of what Infosys tests.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are short on time, are new to technical interviews, or are specifically targeting IT services companies. Efficiently mastering the core Array, String, Math, and **especially Dynamic Programming** patterns in Infosys's list will build a strong foundation. You can then strategically expand into Hash Table and other common topics if adding Bloomberg-level companies to your target list later.

In essence, Bloomberg preparation is a superset of the skills needed for Infosys. Conquering the larger, more diverse list provides wider coverage, but targeted practice on the smaller list is the faster route to success for a specific interview.
