# Linked List Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Linked lists remain a fundamental data structure in technical interviews, testing your understanding of pointers, memory management, and sequential data manipulation. While less common than arrays in day-to-day development, linked list problems effectively assess your ability to think algorithmically and handle edge cases. With 66 questions in our database, they are a consistent topic you must master.

## Common Patterns

Most linked list problems can be solved by applying one of a few core patterns. Recognizing these will turn a confusing problem into a familiar exercise.

**1. Two Pointers (Fast & Slow):** This is the most frequent pattern. Use two pointers moving at different speeds to find the middle node, detect a cycle, or find the *k*th node from the end without knowing the list's length.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

```javascript
function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

</div>

**2. In-Place Reversal:** Reversing a linked list, either wholly or in a subsection, is a classic operation. The iterative method uses three pointers: previous, current, and next.

**3. Dummy Head:** Using a dummy node at the start of your list simplifies edge cases, especially when you need to modify the head (e.g., in removal or partition operations). You return `dummy.next` as the new head.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_elements(head, val):
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    curr = dummy
    while curr.next:
        if curr.next.val == val:
            curr.next = curr.next.next
        else:
            curr = curr.next
    return dummy.next
```

```javascript
function removeElements(head, val) {
  let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
  let curr = dummy;
  while (curr.next) {
    if (curr.next.val === val) {
      curr.next = curr.next.next;
    } else {
      curr = curr.next;
    }
  }
  return dummy.next;
}
```

```java
public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
    ListNode curr = dummy;
    while (curr.next != null) {
        if (curr.next.val == val) {
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
        } else {
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }
    return dummy.next;
}
```

</div>

**4. Merge & Interweave:** This pattern covers merging two sorted lists or reordering a list (like L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 ...). It often combines other patterns, like finding the middle and reversing a sublist.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 71% (47 questions) are Medium difficulty. This split is telling.

- **Easy (18%):** These test basic operations: traversal, insertion, deletion, and simple reversals. They ensure you understand the structure.
- **Medium (71%):** This is the core battleground. Problems here combine the core patterns (e.g., reverse a sublist, detect and find cycle start, merge K sorted lists). Success depends on cleanly implementing patterns and handling null pointers.
- **Hard (11%):** These are complex pattern combinations, often involving multiple data structures (like a hashmap for a deep copy with random pointers) or intricate pointer manipulation (like reversing nodes in K-groups).

The heavy skew toward Medium means you should focus your practice there. If you can reliably solve Medium problems, you are well-prepared.

## Which Companies Ask Linked List

Linked list questions are a staple at major tech companies, often appearing in early coding rounds.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks problems involving cycle detection, merging, and complex pointer manipulation.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Meta](/company/meta) use them to test fundamental data structure skills, with a focus on two-pointer techniques and in-place modification.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) often include linked list problems in their interview loops, particularly those related to system design fundamentals or financial data streams.

## Study Tips

1.  **Draw Before You Code.** Always sketch the list and pointers. Visualizing `next` pointer changes is crucial. Update your drawing step-by-step as you reason through the algorithm.
2.  **Master the Three Key Operations.** Be able to write bug-free code to: a) reverse a list, b) find a cycle, and c) merge two sorted lists. These are building blocks for more complex problems.
3.  **Test Edge Cases Religiously.** Before declaring a solution complete, test it against: an empty list, a single-node list, a two-node list, operations at the head, and operations at the tail.
4.  **Time & Space Complexity.** For linked lists, the optimal solution is often O(n) time and O(1) space. Using extra space (like a hashmap) can simplify a problem, but always ask if in-place pointer manipulation is possible.

Build fluency with these patterns and you will approach linked list problems with a clear strategy.
