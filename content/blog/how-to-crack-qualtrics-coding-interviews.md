Qualtrics coding interviews test practical problem-solving on real engineering challenges. You'll face a 60-90 minute technical screen or onsite round focused on implementing clean, efficient solutions. The problems are designed to assess how you think, code, and communicate under constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our data shows a clear pattern: **1 Easy (20%), 3 Medium (60%), 1 Hard (20%)**. This distribution is critical for your strategy. The single Easy question is often a warm-up on fundamentals. The three Medium problems form the core of the interview—succeeding here is non-negotiable. They typically involve combining standard patterns or adding a twist to a classic problem. The single Hard question is your differentiator; it often requires recognizing a non-obvious approach or optimizing a brute-force solution. Your goal is to confidently solve all Easy and Medium problems while making clear, logical progress on the Hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Array & String:** The foundation. Expect manipulations, sliding window, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.
**Stack:** Essential for parsing, validation, and next-greater-element problems.
**Simulation:** Directly models real-world processes; careful iteration and state management are key.
**Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or combinatorial logic.

For Array/String problems, the **sliding window** pattern is particularly powerful for subarray/substring questions. Here’s a template for finding the longest substring with at most K distinct characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Master the top topics. Solve 15-20 problems on Arrays and Strings, 10-15 on Stack, and 5-10 each on Simulation and Math. Focus on pattern recognition. Implement each solution from scratch.

**Weeks 3-4: Medium Intensity.** Target Medium-difficulty problems exclusively. Aim for 2-3 per day, timed. Practice explaining your approach out loud before coding. Review each problem's optimal solution thoroughly.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Hard Problems.** Simulate the actual interview format weekly. Integrate a Hard problem into each session. Dedicate time to analyzing Qualtrics-specific problems to understand their style of combining topics like simulation with array manipulation.

## Key Tips

**Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, state the brute force, then explain your optimization. Interviewers evaluate your thought progression.

**Prioritize Correctness First.** Write a working, clean solution even if it's not optimal. Then, if time allows, discuss and implement optimizations. A correct O(n²) solution is better than a buggy O(n).

**Test with Edge Cases.** Explicitly run through small inputs, empty cases, and large bounds. Verbally state what you're checking. This demonstrates systematic thinking.

**Manage Your Time.** Allocate roughly: 5-10 minutes for Easy, 15-20 minutes each for Medium, 20-25 minutes for Hard. If stuck on a Medium, outline a fallback approach and move on.

Master these patterns, follow the plan, and you'll be ready to handle the curveballs.
