GE Digital’s coding interviews assess practical problem-solving and clean code. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic questions, often conducted via a collaborative coding platform. The emphasis is on logical reasoning, communication, and translating a solution into working code under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: 33% Easy and 67% Medium difficulty questions, with no Hard problems. This breakdown is strategic. GE Digital interviews are designed to evaluate foundational competency and reliable execution, not academic puzzle-solving. An Easy question tests your basic coding fluency and composure. The two Medium questions are the real gatekeepers—they assess your ability to break down a non-trivial problem, apply appropriate data structures, and implement a solution efficiently. The absence of Hard questions means you should prioritize breadth and mastery of core patterns over drilling on extreme optimization challenges. Your goal is to solve the Medium problems completely and cleanly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Hash Table, Math, Enumeration, and String. Mastery here covers the vast majority of problems you'll see.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, in-place modification, and subarray problems. The **Two-Pointer** technique is essential for solving many array and string problems efficiently.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, deduplication, and mapping relationships. It's often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, basic arithmetic, or simulation. Often combined with enumeration.
- **Enumeration:** Systematically iterating through possibilities, often within constraints. This is a core problem-solving approach.
- **String:** Closely related to array problems. Focus on character manipulation, parsing, and palindrome checks.

The most important pattern across these topics is using a **Hash Table for frequency or complement tracking**. This pattern turns O(n²) solutions into O(n). Here is a classic example: finding two numbers in an array that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
// Example: new Solution().twoSum(new int[]{2,7,11,15}, 9) returns [0,1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than cramming.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Solidify core data structures: Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and basic Math. Solve 30-40 Easy problems on these topics. Focus on writing correct, readable code on the first try.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Patterns.** Dive into Medium difficulty. Target the key patterns: Hash Table mapping (as shown above), Two-Pointer for arrays/strings, and basic enumeration/iteration. Solve 40-50 Medium problems, prioritizing the top topics list. For each problem, practice verbalizing your thought process before coding.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Solve mixed-topic Medium problems under a 30-minute timer. Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the real environment: explain your approach, code, and test with edge cases. Review any lingering weaknesses in the top topics.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Start every problem by restating it in your own words. Talk through your initial thoughts, a brute-force approach, and then your optimized plan. This turns the interview into a collaboration.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** With no Hard problems, a complete, correct, and well-explained solution to two Medium questions is a winning ticket. Don't sacrifice readability for minor optimizations.
3.  **Validate Input and Test.** Explicitly check for edge cases like empty input, single elements, or large values. After coding, walk through a simple test case and a couple of edge cases verbally.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language.** Be prepared to discuss the time and space complexity of your solution using your language's standard library operations (e.g., the cost of an insertion in a Python dict or a Java HashMap).

The GE Digital interview is a test of applied fundamentals. By mastering core data structures and patterns, and by focusing on clear communication, you can demonstrate the practical engineering skill they're looking for.
