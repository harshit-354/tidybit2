When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Infosys and Airbnb represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum—one a global IT services and consulting giant, the other a product-focused tech leader. Their approaches to technical screening, as reflected in their commonly reported question profiles, differ significantly in volume, difficulty, and thematic emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions a candidate might encounter. Infosys has a reported pool of **158 questions**, while Airbnb's pool is more focused at **64 questions**. This suggests that Infosys interviews may pull from a broader, more standardized set of problems, whereas Airbnb's process might involve deeper, more tailored questions from a more curated list.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The majority of questions are Medium (82), with a substantial number of Easy (42) and a significant portion of Hard (34). This indicates a wide-ranging assessment, testing fundamental competency through Easy/Medium problems while still using Hard problems to identify top candidates.
- **Airbnb (E11/M34/H19):** The distribution skews more heavily toward challenging problems. Medium questions form the core (34), but there are relatively few Easy (11) and a higher proportion of Hard (19) compared to its total question count. This points to an interview process that expects strong algorithmic proficiency from the outset and uses complex problems to evaluate design and problem-solving depth.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, with significant overlap in their top four topics: **Array, String, Dynamic Programming (DP),** and **Hash Table** (for Airbnb) / **Math** (for Infosys).

For **Array and String** problems, both companies test manipulation, searching, and transformation. A common pattern is the two-pointer or sliding window technique.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (Python)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (JavaScript)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (Java)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

The key divergence is in the fourth priority. Airbnb's focus on **Hash Table** aligns with product-centric companies that frequently assess real-world data mapping and retrieval efficiency. Infosys's inclusion of **Math** points to a focus on logical reasoning and foundational problem-solving, common in consulting and services roles. **Dynamic Programming** is crucial for both, but the complexity likely differs, with Airbnb's DP problems often being more intricate.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be goal-oriented.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are building core algorithmic competency. The larger volume and wider difficulty range provide a structured path to strengthen fundamentals across many topics. Mastering the Infosys-style problems will give you a solid foundation in pattern recognition. Success here often requires accuracy, clarity, and the ability to handle a variety of problem types efficiently.

**Prepare for Airbnb first if:** You are already comfortable with medium-level coding problems and need to level up on complexity and system design thinking. The focused question set demands deeper mastery of each topic, especially arrays, strings, and hash-based solutions. Airbnb interviews often blend algorithmic challenges with real-world scenarios, testing not just if you can code a solution, but if you can architect an optimal, clean one under discussion.

Ultimately, a strong candidate will be well-versed in the overlapping core topics. Starting with the company whose profile best matches your current skill level is a practical approach, allowing you to build up or specialize as needed.
