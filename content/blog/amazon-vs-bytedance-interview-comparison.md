When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Amazon and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok) are both major players, but their interview landscapes, as reflected in commonly reported coding questions, differ significantly in scale and emphasis. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, core topic overlap, and provides a strategic approach to preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of documented questions. Amazon has a massive, well-established repository of **1,938 questions**, categorized by difficulty: 530 Easy, 1,057 Medium, and 351 Hard problems. This vast pool reflects Amazon's long history of technical recruiting and the breadth of its roles. Preparing for an Amazon interview often feels like preparing for a marathon, requiring broad exposure to many problem patterns.

In contrast, ByteDance's known question set is much smaller, with only **64 questions** documented: 6 Easy, 49 Medium, and 9 Hard. This smaller volume doesn't necessarily mean the interview is easier; it often indicates that ByteDance's process may rely more on evaluating fundamental problem-solving skills on novel or less-leaked problems, or that its intensive interview process is more recent and less documented in public forums. The heavy skew toward Medium-difficulty questions (over 75%) for ByteDance suggests a strong focus on core algorithmic competency under pressure.

**Key Takeaway:** Amazon preparation requires managing a large volume of potential questions, while ByteDance preparation demands deep mastery of medium-difficulty concepts that can be applied to less-predictable problems.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume difference, both companies heavily test the same foundational computer science topics. The core areas are nearly identical:

- **Array & String:** Manipulation, searching, sorting, and sliding window techniques.
- **Hash Table:** For efficient lookups, frequency counting, and caching.
- **Dynamic Programming:** For optimization problems, often involving sequences or grids.

This overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both companies. The implementation of a solution for a problem like "Two Sum" or "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" is conceptually the same, regardless of the interviewer.

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

The difference lies in the specific problem _variations_ you might encounter. Amazon's large question bank includes many more nuanced twists on these core themes.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundational topics**: Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming. Achieve fluency in solving Medium-difficulty problems in these areas. This core competency is the universal key.

If you have interviews at both companies, **prepare for ByteDance first**. Mastering the ~64 documented problems and, more importantly, the underlying patterns for Medium problems will build a solid algorithmic foundation. This focused depth is highly effective for ByteDance's style and simultaneously covers the most common difficulty tier for Amazon.

Once that foundation is set, **expand to Amazon-specific preparation**. Use the vast question bank to expose yourself to a wider variety of problem patterns and to practice the stamina needed for a longer interview loop. Pay special attention to Amazon's Leadership Principles, as they are often explicitly worked into the interview discussion around your code.

**Final Strategy:** Build depth on core algorithms, then expand breadth. The skills are transferable, but the preparation scope is not. A strong ByteDance-ready candidate is well-positioned to tackle a significant portion of Amazon's question pool, while the reverse is less efficiently true.
