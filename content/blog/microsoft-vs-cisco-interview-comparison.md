When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and scope of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Microsoft and Cisco represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of software engineering interview preparation. Microsoft, a software and cloud giant, has a massive, well-documented set of coding problems. Cisco, a leader in networking hardware and software, has a significantly smaller but still important curated list. A strategic approach to these question banks is essential.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer difference in volume is the most striking contrast. Microsoft's list of 1352 questions dwarfs Cisco's 86. This reflects both the breadth of roles at Microsoft and the long history of its questions being aggregated on coding platforms.

The difficulty distribution also offers insight:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty, with a substantial number of Easy and a significant pool of Hard problems. This indicates that to pass a Microsoft interview, you must be proficient at solving moderately complex algorithmic challenges under pressure and may face at least one highly optimized problem.
- **Cisco (E22/M49/H15):** The distribution follows a similar pattern (proportionally more Mediums) but on a much smaller scale. The limited number of Hard questions suggests that while advanced problems can appear, the interview may place a stronger emphasis on foundational competency and practical problem-solving over extreme algorithmic optimization.

This volume difference means your preparation strategy must differ. Mastering Microsoft's list is a marathon requiring months of systematic study. Covering Cisco's core list is a more focused sprint, though deeper knowledge of the tested topics is still required.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core computer science fundamentals, with significant overlap in their top topics.

**Shared Key Topics:**

- **Array & String:** Manipulation, traversal, and transformation of these fundamental data structures are essential for both.
- **Hash Table:** Used for efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving problems related to duplicates or pairs, this is a critical tool for interviews at any company.

**Diverging Focus:**

- **Microsoft** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is a complex topic that often forms the basis of their harder questions. Success at Microsoft requires dedicated practice with DP patterns (knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.).
- **Cisco's** list highlights **Two Pointers** as a core technique. This is often used for solving problems on sorted arrays/strings (like finding pairs or removing duplicates) and is generally considered a step down in conceptual difficulty from DP, though it requires clean implementation.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common in Cisco questions)
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1

# Example: Dynamic Programming (common in Microsoft questions)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common in Cisco questions)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (common in Microsoft questions)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common in Cisco questions)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (common in Microsoft questions)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

The order of preparation should be guided by your timeline and the companies' requirements.

**Prepare for Cisco first if:** You are interviewing with Cisco sooner, or you are early in your algorithmic practice phase. The smaller, more focused question set allows you to build confidence by achieving high coverage of the known list. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Two Pointers) for Cisco creates a solid foundation that is directly transferable to a large portion of Microsoft's problems.

**Prepare for Microsoft first if:** Microsoft is your primary target, or you have a longer timeline. The depth and breadth required will force you to learn advanced topics like Dynamic Programming thoroughly. Successfully preparing for Microsoft effectively subsumes preparation for Cisco's technical screen, as you will have practiced a much wider and deeper set of problems covering all of Cisco's key topics.

In practice, a hybrid approach is effective: use Cisco's list as a targeted set of problems to solidify fundamentals, then expand into Microsoft's list to build the depth and stamina needed for its more demanding interviews. Regardless of the order, consistent practice on the core overlapping topics is the key to success at both.
