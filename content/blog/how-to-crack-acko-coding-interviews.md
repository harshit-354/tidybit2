Acko’s technical interview process is designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to handle complex, real-world system design. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including a coding screen, in-depth algorithmic problem-solving, and system design discussions. For the coding rounds, success hinges on a precise understanding of the patterns and difficulty levels they favor.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a distinctive and challenging profile: **4 questions, with 2 Easy (50%) and 2 Hard (50%). There are no Medium-difficulty questions.**

This distribution is significant. It suggests a two-phase screening process. The Easy questions act as a filter for fundamental competency—can you write clean, bug-free code under pressure? Failing here is an immediate disqualification. The Hard questions are the real differentiator. They are used to separate good candidates from exceptional ones. Acko is looking for engineers who can not only solve straightforward problems but also grapple with substantial algorithmic complexity. The absence of Medium questions indicates they are less interested in the middle ground; they want to see both baseline proficiency and high-caliber problem-solving.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study must be intensely focused. These five areas dominate Acko's question set.

1.  **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Essential for optimizing overlapping subproblems, frequently appearing in their hardest challenges. Master both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
2.  **Array:** The foundation for most data manipulation. Expect questions on traversal, partitioning, and subarray problems that often serve as a precursor to more complex DP solutions.
3.  **Graph Theory:** Critical for modeling relationships. Be prepared for both traversal (BFS/DFS) and advanced algorithms, especially given the co-occurrence with Topological Sort.
4.  **Topological Sort:** A specific but vital graph algorithm for ordering dependent tasks. This is a high-signal topic; if it appears, it's likely in a Hard problem.
5.  **Database:** While not directly tested in pure coding rounds, this indicates a strong focus on system design and SQL/problem-solving in later interview stages.

Given that **Dynamic Programming** and **Graph Theory/Topological Sort** are the core of the Hard problems, they demand the most practice. A fundamental DP pattern like the "House Robber" problem (finding the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements) is a perfect building block.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    # dp[i] represents max money robbable up to house i
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    for i in range(2, n):
        # Choice: rob current house + dp[i-2] or skip it (take dp[i-1])
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])

    return dp[n-1]
```

```javascript
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

  let dp = new Array(nums.length);
  dp[0] = nums[0];
  dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

  for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2]);
  }

  return dp[nums.length - 1];
}
```

```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

    for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2]);
    }
    return dp[nums.length - 1];
}
```

For **Topological Sort**, know the Kahn's Algorithm (BFS using indegree) by heart, as it's the most common implementation for task scheduling problems.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Master **Array** and basic **Graph Theory** (BFS, DFS, cycle detection). Solve 15-20 Easy problems to build speed and accuracy.
- Days 8-14: Dive deep into **Dynamic Programming**. Start with classical problems (Fibonacci, KnapSack, LCS) and progress to harder variants. Solve at least 15 DP problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Integration**

- Focus on **Topological Sort** and advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Union-Find). Solve 5-10 problems combining graphs with other concepts.
- Integrate topics. Practice problems where DP is applied on arrays or graphs. This is where Acko's Hard questions live.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Repair**

- Simulate the actual interview format. Do 2-3 mock sessions per week, each with a mix of 1 Easy and 1 Hard problem under timed conditions.
- Systematically review **Database** concepts (indexing, transactions, query optimization) for the system design round.
- Re-solve all previously attempted Hard problems without help.

## Key Tips

1.  **Ace the Easy Questions Flawlessly.** Your solution must be optimal in time/space and impeccably clean. Practice writing production-ready code from the first line.
2.  **Communicate Your DP State Clearly.** When tackling Hard DP problems, verbally define your `dp` array/table before coding. Say, "Let `dp[i][j]` represent the answer for the subproblem up to index `i` with state `j`." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Draw Graphs.** For any problem involving dependencies or networks, immediately sketch the graph on the whiteboard or in your editor. Visualizing the problem is half the battle for Topological Sort and graph traversal.
4.  **Practice Time-Boxing.** Allocate a strict 10-12 minutes for each Easy problem and 25-30 minutes for each Hard one. If stuck, explain your fallback approach (a brute-force solution) before optimizing.

Success at Acko requires demonstrating both breadth of skill and depth of analytical prowess. Target the extremes of their difficulty curve, and you will be prepared.
