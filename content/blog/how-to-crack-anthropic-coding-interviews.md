Anthropic’s coding interviews are designed to assess not just raw algorithmic skill, but also clarity of thought, communication, and the ability to reason about complex systems. While the process may evolve, the core remains a series of technical screens and on-site interviews focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design. Success hinges on methodical preparation and a deep understanding of fundamental patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our analysis of recent Anthropic interview questions reveals a clear, challenging trend: **100% of the coding problems are categorized as Medium difficulty**. There are no "Easy" warm-ups or "Hard" brain-teasers in the typical question pool. This distribution is telling.

It means Anthropic is not testing your ability to recall trivial facts or solve obscure puzzles. Instead, they are evaluating your consistent, reliable skill in applying core computer science concepts to non-trivial, realistic problems. You must demonstrate fluency—writing clean, correct, and efficient code under pressure for problems that require multiple logical steps. The absence of "Hard" questions suggests a focus on foundational mastery over competitive programming tricks. Your goal is to solve these Medium problems flawlessly, with optimal time and space complexity, while articulating your reasoning clearly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows four dominant topics: **Array, Stack, Hash Table, and String**. These are the pillars of Anthropic's coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques. These test your ability to manage indices and state efficiently.
- **Stack:** Crucial for parsing, validation (like parentheses), and maintaining order. Problems often involve tracking intermediate results or reversing sequences.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, memoization, and mapping relationships to solve problems in linear time.
- **String:** Frequently combined with other topics. Focus on character encoding, palindrome checks, and substring searches.

A critical pattern that combines **Array** and **Hash Table** is the "Two-Sum" variant, often extended to finding subarrays or pairs satisfying complex conditions. The core technique is using a hash map to store prior computed values (like prefixes) for instant lookup.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, k):
    # Finds count of subarrays summing to k
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    # Map: prefix_sum -> frequency of that sum seen so far
    sum_freq = {0: 1}

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # If (prefix_sum - k) exists, a subarray ending here sums to k
        count += sum_freq.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Record the current prefix sum
        sum_freq[prefix_sum] = sum_freq.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumFreq = new Map();
  sumFreq.set(0, 1);

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    if (sumFreq.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumFreq.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    sumFreq.set(prefixSum, (sumFreq.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumFreq = new HashMap<>();
    sumFreq.put(0, 1);

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        // If a previous prefixSum such that (current - previous == k) exists, add its frequency
        count += sumFreq.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        // Update frequency of current prefixSum
        sumFreq.put(prefixSum, sumFreq.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is essential to cover the required breadth and depth.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition**
Focus exclusively on the top four topics (Array, Stack, Hash Table, String). Use a reputable coding platform and solve 15-20 Medium problems per topic. Don't just solve—categorize each problem by pattern (e.g., "sliding window," "monotonic stack," "hash map for prefix"). Implement each solution in your primary language, then re-implement it in a second language to reinforce syntax.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Mock Interviews**
Start solving problems that combine topics, like "String parsing with Stack" or "Array with Hash Table and two pointers." This mimics real interview complexity. Begin weekly mock interviews with a peer or using a timer. Practice verbalizing your entire thought process, from clarifying questions to complexity analysis, before writing code.

**Weeks 5-6: Refinement & Company-Specific Practice**
Dedicate this phase to Anthropic-specific preparation. Re-solve all problems you initially found challenging. Complete every available Anthropic-labeled question you can find. Conduct at least 2-3 high-fidelity mock interviews per week, simulating the exact interview format (e.g., 45 minutes, one to two Medium problems).

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code:** Never go silent. Frame your approach aloud. Ask clarifying questions about input boundaries and edge cases. An interviewer who understands your reasoning is more likely to guide you if you stumble.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity Over Premature Optimization:** Write readable, brute-force logic first if needed, then optimize. A correct, well-structured O(n²) solution is far better than a buggy, rushed O(n) attempt. Refactor once the logic is solid.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Verbally:** Before declaring completion, walk through test cases: empty input, single element, large values, sorted/reversed inputs. State what the expected output is. This demonstrates professional thoroughness.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language's Standard Library Cold:** Be able to use key utilities (e.g., `collections.Counter` in Python, `Map`/`Set` in JavaScript, `HashMap`/`StringBuilder` in Java) without hesitation or looking up syntax. Fluency here saves critical time.

Mastering these focused topics and strategies will build the consistent, high-level proficiency Anthropic's interviews demand. Start with the fundamentals, integrate them under pressure, and practice articulating your solutions.
