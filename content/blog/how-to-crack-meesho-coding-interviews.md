Meesho’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or CodeSignal. Success hinges on a targeted preparation strategy that aligns with the specific patterns and difficulty levels Meesho favors.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing a dataset of 44 Meesho coding questions reveals a clear, challenging profile:

- **Easy:** 4 questions (9%)
- **Medium:** 22 questions (50%)
- **Hard:** 18 questions (41%)

This distribution is significant. With 91% of questions at Medium or Hard difficulty, Meesho's interviews are not about checking basic syntax. They are testing your depth of knowledge. The high proportion of Hard problems (41%) indicates you must be comfortable with complex problem decomposition, advanced algorithms, and optimizing for edge cases. You cannot afford to be shaky on core data structures.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these high-frequency topics, which account for the majority of Meesho's question pool.

1.  **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving subarrays, sorting, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.
2.  **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical area given the difficulty skew. Master identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in strings, sequences, and partition problems.
3.  **Math:** Problems often involve number theory, combinatorics, or clever mathematical insights to avoid brute-force solutions.
4.  **Hash Table:** Essential for achieving O(1) lookups. Used heavily in problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, and caching intermediate results.
5.  **String:** Closely tied to Array and DP. Focus on manipulation, pattern matching, palindromes, and anagram-related problems.

For Meesho, **Dynamic Programming** is arguably the most important topic to master due to its prevalence in Hard problems. A fundamental pattern is the "0/1 Knapsack" or "DP on sequences."

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    # DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take the item
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip the item
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w] # Cannot take this item
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  // DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        // Option 1: Take the item
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        // Option 2: Skip the item
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]; // Cannot take this item
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example usage
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        // DP table: dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    // Option 1: Take the item
                    int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                    // Option 2: Skip the item
                    int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]; // Cannot take this item
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 6-Week Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a 6-week plan to build and sharpen the required skills.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Deep dive into **Arrays** and **Hash Tables**. Practice two-pointer, sliding window, and prefix sum techniques.
- Days 8-14: Master **String** manipulation and pattern matching. Connect these problems to array techniques.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Algorithms**

- Days 15-21: Focus entirely on **Dynamic Programming**. Start with 1D DP (Fibonacci, climbing stairs), move to 2D DP (knapsack, LCS), and tackle harder problems like DP on trees or partitions.
- Days 22-28: Tackle **Math**-based problems. Practice prime numbers, GCD/LCM, combinatorics, and bit manipulation.

**Weeks 5-5.5: Meesho-Specific Practice**

- Solve 3-4 problems daily, exclusively from Meesho's question list. Prioritize Medium and Hard problems. Time yourself to simulate interview pressure.

**Week 5.5-6: Mock Interviews & Revision**

- Conduct at least 3-4 mock interviews with a peer or mentor using Meesho-style Hard problems.
- Revisit all incorrect problems. Systematically review the patterns for your weak topics (likely DP and advanced array problems).

## Key Tips

1.  **Think Aloud, Always.** Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving process. Verbally articulate your thought process, from brute-force idea to optimized solution. This is crucial for Hard problems where the path isn't immediately clear.
2.  **Optimize Relentlessly.** For any initial solution, immediately analyze its time and space complexity. Ask yourself, "Can I use a hash map to reduce lookups? Is there a DP state I'm missing?" Meesho's bar for optimization is high.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use clear variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, large values) before you start coding. Sloppy code will cost you.
4.  **Practice Under Time Constraints.** Set a strict 35-minute timer for solving a Medium/Hard problem, including explanation. This builds the pace and stamina needed for the actual interview.

Targeted, disciplined practice on the right patterns is the most reliable way to succeed. Start with the core topics, pressure-test your skills with Hard problems, and refine your communication.
