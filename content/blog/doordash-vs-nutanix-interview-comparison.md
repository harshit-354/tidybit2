When preparing for technical interviews at DoorDash and Nutanix, you'll find a significant overlap in the core data structures and algorithms tested. Both companies heavily emphasize fundamental computer science concepts, with Array, Hash Table, String, and Depth-First Search (DFS) appearing as top topics. This suggests a strong focus on problem-solving with common data structures and graph/tree traversal. However, the key differences lie in the volume of questions, the distribution of difficulty, and the underlying business context that often shapes problem scenarios.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

DoorDash presents a larger and more challenging question bank. With 87 total questions, its distribution (87 questions: 51 Medium, 30 Hard) indicates a greater emphasis on complex problem-solving. The high number of Hard questions suggests you can expect several rounds involving multi-step optimization problems, often related to real-time systems, logistics, or mapping.

Nutanix, with 68 total questions, has a slightly more moderate distribution (68 questions: 46 Medium, 17 Hard). While still challenging, the lower proportion of Hard questions implies the interview might focus more on demonstrating strong, clean implementation of core algorithms and systems design principles, consistent with its enterprise cloud infrastructure focus.

In practice, this means preparing for DoorDash requires drilling down on intricate variations of classic problems, while Nutanix preparation should ensure rock-solid fundamentals with a few deeply practiced hard problems.

## Topic Overlap

The stated top topics are identical, but the application differs. Both will test your ability to manipulate arrays and strings and use hash tables for efficient lookups. Depth-First Search is critical for both, but the problem domains vary.

At DoorDash, DFS and related graph algorithms are frequently applied to problems mimicking delivery route optimization, menu or restaurant category traversal, and order dispatch logic. You might traverse a graph representing a map or a tree representing a decision flow.

```python
# Example DFS skeleton for a route/network problem
def dfs(node, graph, visited):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    # Process node (e.g., check if it's a valid delivery location)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor, graph, visited)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS skeleton for a route/network problem
function dfs(node, graph, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  // Process node
  for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
  }
}
```

```java
// Example DFS skeleton for a route/network problem
public void dfs(Node node, Map<Node, List<Node>> graph, Set<Node> visited) {
    if (visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    // Process node
    for (Node neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
    }
}
```

</div>

At Nutanix, DFS is just as crucial but often appears in the context of traversing directory structures, dependency graphs in distributed systems, or network topologies. Problems may involve serialization/deserialization of trees or detecting cycles in resource graphs.

The common ground is that mastery of these four topics forms a non-negotiable foundation for either interview.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for DoorDash first if you are targeting both companies. Its larger and more difficult question set will force you to reach a higher ceiling of problem-solving skill. Mastering the DoorDash question bank inherently covers the depth and breadth needed for Nutanix, as the core topics are the same. The additional practice with complex Hard problems will make Nutanix's Medium-heavy set feel more manageable.

If you are only targeting Nutanix, you can focus more efficiently. Prioritize a deep understanding of all common Medium-difficulty problems on Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and DFS/Graphs. Ensure you can implement flawless, production-quality code for these fundamentals. Then, selectively practice a subset of Hard problems, particularly those involving tree/graph manipulation and system-related scenarios.

In summary, use the DoorDash list to push your limits and the Nutanix list to solidify your core. The overlap makes dual preparation efficient, with DoorDash serving as the more comprehensive training ground.
