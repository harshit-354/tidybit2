When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are prioritized. Samsung and Yahoo, while both established tech giants, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks. Samsung's set is slightly larger and leans toward more advanced problem-solving, while Yahoo's emphasizes foundational data manipulation. Understanding these differences helps you allocate your preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Samsung's repository contains 69 questions, categorized as 15 Easy, 37 Medium, and 17 Hard. This distribution indicates a strong focus on intermediate and advanced problem-solving, with over half the questions being Medium difficulty and a significant quarter being Hard. The high number of Hard problems suggests Samsung interviews frequently assess complex algorithmic thinking, often involving optimization or intricate logic.

Yahoo's set has 64 questions, with a breakdown of 26 Easy, 32 Medium, and only 6 Hard. This profile is more skewed toward foundational and intermediate concepts. The large number of Easy questions implies Yahoo's process may include more initial screening problems or place greater emphasis on clean, correct implementation of standard techniques. The relatively low count of Hard questions suggests the most challenging algorithmic hurdles are less common than at Samsung.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **Hash Table** fundamentals. This is the core overlap. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

**Samsung's** additional key topics are **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Two Pointers**. The prominence of DP aligns with their many Medium/Hard questions, as DP is a classic method for solving optimization problems. Two Pointers is essential for efficient array and string manipulation, often appearing in Medium-difficulty scenarios.

**Yahoo's** other primary areas are **String** and **Sorting**. The String focus points to questions involving parsing, matching, and transformation, which are common in web and data processing contexts. Sorting is a fundamental operation that serves as a building block for many other solutions.

Here is a typical problem that might appear in either company's interviews, solved using a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

A problem more characteristic of Samsung's focus on Two Pointers:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Yahoo first** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. Its question bank, with a higher proportion of Easy problems and a focus on Strings and Sorting, provides a broad foundation in common data structure manipulation. Solidifying these core skills will make you interview-ready for a wider range of companies and build confidence.

Prepare for **Samsung first** if you are already comfortable with core algorithms and need to level up on advanced topics. Tackling their significant number of Medium and Hard problems, especially in Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers, will sharpen your problem-solving skills under pressure. This deep dive is excellent preparation for any interview that includes a "hard" round.

Ultimately, the shared emphasis on Arrays and Hash Tables means mastering these topics serves you for both. Start with the company whose difficulty profile best matches your current skill level, then use the other to fill gaps.
