When preparing for technical interviews at Yandex and Capital One, understanding the distinct focus and volume of their question banks is crucial for efficient study. Both companies test core computer science fundamentals, but their approach, depth, and expected proficiency differ significantly. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of the question pools.

**Yandex** presents a substantial challenge with **134 questions**, heavily weighted toward medium difficulty. The distribution (Easy: 52, Medium: 72, Hard: 10) indicates a strong focus on solid algorithmic problem-solving. You must be highly proficient at medium-level problems, which often require combining concepts like two-pointer techniques with hash tables or string manipulation under constraints. The high volume suggests a broad and potentially unpredictable interview, testing both speed and adaptability.

**Capital One** has a more focused question bank of **57 questions**, also with a medium-difficulty core (Easy: 11, Medium: 36, Hard: 10). While the number of Hard problems is identical to Yandex, the overall smaller pool means each topic area is more concentrated. Preparation can be more targeted, but mastery of the listed mediums is non-negotiable. The lower volume does not imply easier interviews; it often means the problems are carefully chosen to test precise application of fundamentals in a business-logic context.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. This is the universal foundation for coding interviews.

- **Yandex** explicitly lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic. This signals a strong emphasis on in-place array/string manipulation, sliding window algorithms, and optimization problems (e.g., "3Sum," "Trapping Rain Water"). You can expect problems that test your ability to manage multiple indices efficiently.
  <div class="code-group">

  ```python
  # Yandex-style: Two Pointers for sorted array two-sum
  def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
      left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
      while left < right:
          current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
          if current_sum == target:
              return [left + 1, right + 1]
          elif current_sum < target:
              left += 1
          else:
              right -= 1
      return []
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Yandex-style: Two Pointers for sorted array two-sum
  function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
    let left = 0,
      right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
      if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
      if (sum < target) left++;
      else right--;
    }
    return [];
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Yandex-style: Two Pointers for sorted array two-sum
  public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
      int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
      while (left < right) {
          int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
          if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
          if (sum < target) left++;
          else right--;
      }
      return new int[]{};
  }
  ```

- **Capital One** uniquely highlights **Math** as a primary topic. This points to a higher likelihood of number theory problems, simulations, or calculations (e.g., "Reverse Integer," "Pow(x, n)," "Happy Number"). Problems may involve modulo arithmetic, handling overflows, or implementing basic operations.
  <div class="code-group">

  ```python
  # Capital One-style: Math problem (Reverse Integer)
  def reverse(x):
      INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1
      rev = 0
      sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
      x = abs(x)
      while x != 0:
          pop = x % 10
          x //= 10
          # Check for overflow before multiplying
          if rev > (INT_MAX - pop) // 10:
              return 0
          rev = rev * 10 + pop
      return sign * rev
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Capital One-style: Math problem (Reverse Integer)
  function reverse(x) {
    const INT_MAX = 2 ** 31 - 1,
      INT_MIN = -(2 ** 31);
    let rev = 0;
    while (x !== 0) {
      const pop = x % 10;
      x = Math.trunc(x / 10);
      if (rev > Math.trunc((INT_MAX - pop) / 10) || rev < Math.trunc((INT_MIN - pop) / 10))
        return 0;
      rev = rev * 10 + pop;
    }
    return rev;
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Capital One-style: Math problem (Reverse Integer)
  public int reverse(int x) {
      int rev = 0;
      while (x != 0) {
          int pop = x % 10;
          x /= 10;
          if (rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
          if (rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
          rev = rev * 10 + pop;
      }
      return rev;
  }
  ```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Capital One first** if you are early in your interview journey or prioritizing financial sector roles. The smaller, more focused question bank allows for deeper mastery of core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) with the added twist of Math problems. Achieving fluency here builds a strong foundation.

Transition to **Yandex preparation** after solidifying the core. The larger volume and emphasis on Two Pointers require you to scale your problem-solving speed and learn to quickly identify which pattern (hashing, sliding window, sorting) applies to a novel, medium-difficulty problem. Yandex prep will rigorously test the fundamentals you built while studying for Capital One.

Ultimately, mastering the shared core topics provides significant overlap. Prioritize based on your target industry and use the distinct focus areas—Two Pointers for Yandex, Math for Capital One—to direct your final, company-specific deep dives.
