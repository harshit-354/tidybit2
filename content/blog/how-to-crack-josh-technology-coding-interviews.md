Josh Technology’s coding interviews are known for a strong emphasis on core data structures and algorithmic problem-solving. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including an online assessment focused on DSA, followed by technical interviews that dive deep into implementation and optimization. Success hinges on a clear, efficient approach to medium-difficulty problems.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 36 recent Josh Technology questions reveals a clear pattern: **72% (26 questions) are of Medium difficulty**. Easy problems account for 19%, and Hard problems only 8%. This distribution is critical—it tells you that the interview is designed to assess solid competency, not genius-level optimization. You are expected to reliably solve problems involving combinations of standard data structures, like traversing a tree while using a hash map. The hard problems are rare, but they test if you can handle complex graph or DP scenarios under pressure. The goal is to master the medium tier; if you can consistently solve these within 30-40 minutes, you are in a strong position.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a definitive set of high-priority areas. Allocate 70% of your study time to these.

- **Array:** The most frequent topic. Expect problems involving subarrays, two-pointer techniques, and sliding windows.
- **Linked List:** Focus on pointer manipulation, cycle detection, and merging or reversing lists.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A fundamental traversal method applied extensively in tree and graph problems.
- **Tree / Binary Tree:** Central to many questions. You must be fluent in all traversals (recursive and iterative), path-sum problems, and subtree checks.

For Josh Technology, mastering **Tree Traversals with DFS** is non-negotiable. It's the engine for countless problems. Here is the essential recursive DFS pattern for a binary tree:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order: Process node here
    dfs(node.left)
    # In-order: Process node here
    dfs(node.right)
    # Post-order: Process node here
```

```javascript
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order: Process node here
  dfs(node.left);
  // In-order: Process node here
  dfs(node.right);
  // Post-order: Process node here
}
```

```java
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Pre-order: Process node here
    dfs(node.left);
    // In-order: Process node here
    dfs(node.right);
    // Post-order: Process node here
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

This plan is built around the 72% medium-difficulty core.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
_ Days 1-7: **Arrays & Linked Lists.** Complete 15-20 problems covering two-pointers, sliding windows, and basic pointer manipulation.
_ Days 8-14: **Trees & DFS.** Internalize all traversal orders. Practice path problems (sum, diameter) and subtree identification. Solve at least 20 tree problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Practice**
_ Focus on problems that combine topics, like "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal" (Tree + BFS) or "Copy List with Random Pointer" (LinkedList + Hash Map). This mimics the Josh Tech medium problem style.
_ Start timed practice sessions (45 minutes per problem). Begin with company-tagged questions on platforms.

**Weeks 5-6: Assessment & Refinement**
_ Take full 2-hour mock interviews focusing only on medium problems.
_ Revisit all incorrect problems from previous weeks. Your goal is not to see new problems, but to ensure old ones are solved flawlessly and quickly. \* In the final days, review core syntax and standard library functions for your language to avoid minor implementation delays.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process First.** Before writing code, state the brute-force approach, then explain your optimized solution's data structures and time/space complexity. Interviewers assess clarity of thought.
2.  **Write Clean, Compilable Code.** Use clear variable names, define your data structures, and avoid clever one-liners that are hard to debug. Write code as if it will be reviewed by a colleague.
3.  **Test with Your Own Cases.** After coding, don't just state it's done. Walk through a small but non-trivial example input, including edge cases (empty tree, single node, sorted array).
4.  **If Stuck, Use a Concrete Example.** For a tricky pointer or tree problem, don't just stare. Draw a small sample (3-4 nodes) on the whiteboard or in comments and trace your logic through it. This often reveals the pattern.

Focus on systematic, medium-difficulty problem-solving over obscure algorithms. Depth in core topics beats breadth in exotic ones for this interview.
