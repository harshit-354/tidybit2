When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. DoorDash and ServiceNow, while both prominent in the tech landscape, present distinct interview profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core focus areas. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question patterns to help you tailor your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions and their difficulty spread reveals the expected interview intensity for each company.

**DoorDash** lists 87 questions with a distribution of 87 Easy, 51 Medium, and 30 Hard questions. This indicates a significant emphasis on Medium and Hard problems. The high proportion of challenging questions suggests that DoorDash interviews are designed to rigorously test advanced problem-solving and optimization skills, particularly for senior engineering roles. Candidates should be prepared for complex scenarios that go beyond foundational knowledge.

**ServiceNow** lists 78 questions with a distribution of 78 Easy, 58 Medium, and 12 Hard questions. The key differentiator here is the relatively low number of Hard questions. This points to an interview process that heavily prioritizes a strong, flawless grasp of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The expectation is likely that candidates can efficiently and correctly solve common patterns, with less focus on extreme optimization or obscure algorithmic tricks. Success hinges on consistency and accuracy with core concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a strong foundation in fundamental data structures, but with a notable divergence in one key area.

The top topics for both include **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table**. This overlap means a significant portion of your preparation will be universally applicable. You must be adept at manipulating arrays and strings, and using hash maps for efficient lookups and state management. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews.

The critical difference lies in their fourth most frequent topic:

- **DoorDash** frequently uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, indicating a strong emphasis on **graph and tree traversal problems**. You should be thoroughly comfortable with recursive and iterative DFS, backtracking, and solving problems related to navigation, paths, and hierarchical structures.
- **ServiceNow** frequently uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, signaling an importance placed on **optimization problems and overlapping subproblems**. Mastery of classic DP patterns (knapsack, longest common subsequence, coin change) and the ability to derive optimal substructure is essential.

```python
# Example DFS (Tree Path Sum)
def has_path_sum(root, target_sum):
    if not root:
        return False
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return target_sum == root.val
    new_sum = target_sum - root.val
    return (has_path_sum(root.left, new_sum) or
            has_path_sum(root.right, new_sum))

# Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DFS (Tree Path Sum)
function hasPathSum(root, targetSum) {
  if (!root) return false;
  if (!root.left && !root.right) return targetSum === root.val;
  const newSum = targetSum - root.val;
  return hasPathSum(root.left, newSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, newSum);
}

// Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DFS (Tree Path Sum)
public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
    if (root == null) return false;
    if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return targetSum == root.val;
    int newSum = targetSum - root.val;
    return hasPathSum(root.left, newSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, newSum);
}

// Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and current skill level.

Prepare for **ServiceNow first** if you are strengthening your core fundamentals. The lower volume of Hard questions allows you to build confidence and speed with the essential Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming patterns. Achieving mastery here creates a solid platform for tackling more difficult problems. It's an efficient strategy for general interview readiness.

Prepare for **DoorDash first** if you are aiming for a senior-level position or need to deepen your advanced algorithmic knowledge. The higher concentration of Medium and Hard questions, especially those involving DFS and graphs, requires dedicated, deep practice. This preparation is more demanding but will thoroughly test and improve your ability to handle complex, multi-step problems.

Regardless of your priority, the shared focus on arrays, strings, and hash tables means your initial study efforts should be directed there. Once comfortable, branch into Depth-First Search for DoorDash or Dynamic Programming for ServiceNow.
