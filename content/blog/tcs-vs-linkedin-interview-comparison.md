When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question lists can be valuable, but their focus varies significantly. A comparison between Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and LinkedIn reveals distinct priorities in their coding assessments, reflecting their different business models and engineering needs. TCS, a global IT services and consulting giant, tests for strong foundational problem-solving, while LinkedIn, a social networking platform for professionals, emphasizes more complex algorithmic thinking and data structure manipulation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of curated questions and their difficulty distribution is the first major point of divergence.

**TCS** has a larger overall pool with **217 questions**. The breakdown is heavily skewed towards easier and medium problems: **94 Easy (E)**, **103 Medium (M)**, and only **20 Hard (H)**. This suggests that TCS interviews are designed to assess core competency, logical thinking, and the ability to write clean, working code for standard problems. Success here often depends on accuracy, clarity, and covering edge cases rather than solving obscure, highly complex algorithms.

**LinkedIn** has a slightly smaller pool of **180 questions**, but with a markedly different difficulty profile: **26 Easy**, **117 Medium**, and **37 Hard**. The emphasis is overwhelmingly on Medium problems, with a substantial number of Hard challenges. This indicates that LinkedIn's technical bar is set higher, expecting candidates to comfortably solve moderately complex problems and have the analytical skill to tackle advanced ones. The interview likely probes deeper into optimization and the trade-offs between different approaches.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong focus on fundamental data structures, but their specialization areas differ.

The **core overlapping topics** are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. These are the absolute essentials for any software engineering interview. Mastery here is non-negotiable for both companies.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Crucial for both
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Crucial for both
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Crucial for both
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The **key differentiators** are in their secondary focus areas:

- **TCS** prominently features **Two Pointers**. This is a critical pattern for solving problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or searching for pairs efficiently.
<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Pointers for a sorted array
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers for a sorted array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers for a sorted array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

- **LinkedIn** places significant importance on **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a fundamental graph and tree traversal algorithm. This aligns with LinkedIn's domain, which involves navigating social graphs, hierarchical data, and recommendation systems.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation strategy should be dictated by your experience level and target.

**Prepare for TCS first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting IT services/consultancy roles. The higher volume of Easy/Medium questions provides a broader set of foundational problems to build confidence, speed, and bug-free coding habits. Solidifying Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and the Two Pointers pattern will cover a vast majority of their question pool.

**Prepare for LinkedIn first if:** You are already comfortable with core data structures and are aiming for product-based or tech-first companies. Focusing on LinkedIn's list will force you to grapple with a higher density of Medium and Hard problems, particularly delving into graph traversal (DFS), which is a common weakness. This preparation will inherently cover the easier problems and build the algorithmic maturity needed for a wider range of top-tier companies.

Ultimately, the shared foundation is key. Mastering the overlapping topics of Array, String, and Hash Table will serve you well for either company. You can then branch out to specialize in Two Pointers for TCS-style interviews or DFS and advanced graph problems for LinkedIn-style interviews.
