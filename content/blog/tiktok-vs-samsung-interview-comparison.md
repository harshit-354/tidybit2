When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns matter. TikTok and Samsung represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in both volume and focus. TikTok's list is large and generalist, reflecting its fast-paced, product-driven engineering culture. Samsung's list is smaller and more concentrated, often aligning with hardware-adjacent software problems and algorithmic efficiency. Your preparation strategy should differ significantly for each.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

TikTok's 383 questions dwarf Samsung's 69. This volume indicates that TikTok's question bank is broad, aiming to test a wide range of fundamentals and problem-solving speed. The difficulty distribution (Easy 42, Medium 260, Hard 81) is heavily skewed toward Medium and Hard problems. This suggests that passing a TikTok interview typically requires consistent, high-level performance on complex algorithmic challenges, often under time pressure.

Samsung's set of 69 questions is more manageable to review. The distribution (Easy 15, Medium 37, Hard 17) still emphasizes Medium problems but with a notable portion of Easy questions. This could indicate that early screening rounds might involve more straightforward problems, with difficulty ramping up in later stages. The smaller volume means questions may be repeated or closely mirrored more often, making focused preparation highly effective.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, making these critical areas to master.

- **Array** manipulation is fundamental. Expect problems involving traversal, sorting, and in-place modifications.
- **Dynamic Programming** is a key differentiator for complex problems. You must be comfortable with defining states, transitions, and optimizing space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

The secondary topics reveal a difference in style. TikTok frequently uses **String** and **Hash Table** problems, common in application development for tasks like parsing, validation, and caching. Samsung's list highlights **Two Pointers**, a technique essential for solving optimization problems on sorted arrays or lists, which is common in systems and efficiency-focused coding.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Two Pointers (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read-1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Example Two Pointers (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Example Two Pointers (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Samsung first** if you are interviewing with both. Its smaller, more concentrated question set allows for efficient, targeted study. Mastering its core topics (Array, DP, Two Pointers) will build a strong foundation. You can achieve coverage and confidence more quickly.

TikTok's vast question bank requires a long-term, generalist strategy. Preparing for it is akin to preparing for a high-stakes, generic coding interview. The skills built while studying for Samsung—especially in DP and arrays—will transfer directly to TikTok preparation. After Samsung, shift focus to TikTok by expanding your practice to include a wider variety of String and Hash Table problems, and by tackling a larger volume of Medium and Hard difficulties to build endurance and speed.

Ultimately, Samsung is a tactical target; TikTok is a marathon.
