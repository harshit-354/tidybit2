Agoda’s coding interviews are a direct assessment of your problem-solving skills and coding fluency. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often conducted via a collaborative coding platform. Questions are practical and lean towards real-world scenarios common in travel tech, such as data processing, string manipulation, and optimization. Success hinges on systematic preparation aligned with their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 46 Agoda coding questions reveals a clear focus on core, solvable problems within a timed interview. The distribution is: **Easy (16 questions, 35%)**, **Medium (28 questions, 61%)**, and **Hard (2 questions, 4%)**.

This breakdown is highly instructive. The overwhelming majority (96%) of questions are at the Easy or Medium level. This indicates Agoda’s interview is designed to evaluate **foundational proficiency and clean coding under pressure**, rather than esoteric algorithm knowledge. The two Hard questions are outliers; you should be prepared for a challenging follow-up, but your primary study goal must be mastering Medium problems. The high volume of Medium questions means you must be both fast and accurate—solving a problem correctly is not enough if you can't articulate your reasoning and write bug-free code efficiently.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these high-frequency topics that account for the bulk of Agoda's questions.

- **Array:** Fundamental to almost all data processing. Expect tasks involving traversal, searching, and in-place manipulation.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions. Crucial for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or matching pairs.
- **String:** Common in travel tech for handling booking codes, user inputs, or data parsing. Focus on manipulation, comparison, and sliding window techniques.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for more complex algorithms like two-pointer solutions. Understanding built-in sort efficiency is key.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Appears in optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum/maximum cost/path"). While less frequent than array/string, it's a classic medium-difficulty differentiator.

The most critical pattern to master is the **Hash Table for frequency counting**, often combined with array or string traversal. It's the backbone for solving a huge variety of Easy and Medium problems.

```python
def find_majority_element(nums):
    """
    Returns the element appearing more than n/2 times (if exists).
    A classic frequency counting problem.
    """
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
        if count[num] > len(nums) // 2:
            return num
    return None  # Or handle as per problem statement

# Example usage with Boyer-Moore (a follow-up optimization)
def find_majority_optimized(nums):
    candidate, votes = None, 0
    for num in nums:
        if votes == 0:
            candidate = num
        votes += 1 if num == candidate else -1
    # Verify candidate if input doesn't guarantee a majority
    return candidate if nums.count(candidate) > len(nums)//2 else None
```

```javascript
function findMajorityElement(nums) {
  // Frequency counting using a Map
  const count = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    const currentCount = (count.get(num) || 0) + 1;
    count.set(num, currentCount);
    if (currentCount > Math.floor(nums.length / 2)) {
      return num;
    }
  }
  return null;
}

// Optimized version (Boyer-Moore)
function findMajorityOptimized(nums) {
  let candidate = null;
  let votes = 0;
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (votes === 0) {
      candidate = num;
    }
    votes += num === candidate ? 1 : -1;
  }
  // Verification step
  return nums.filter((n) => n === candidate).length > Math.floor(nums.length / 2)
    ? candidate
    : null;
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public Integer findMajorityElement(int[] nums) {
        // Frequency counting with HashMap
        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            int currentCount = count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1;
            count.put(num, currentCount);
            if (currentCount > nums.length / 2) {
                return num;
            }
        }
        return null; // or throw exception
    }

    // Optimized version (Boyer-Moore)
    public Integer findMajorityOptimized(int[] nums) {
        Integer candidate = null;
        int votes = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (votes == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            votes += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        // Verify
        int finalCount = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == candidate) finalCount++;
        }
        return (finalCount > nums.length / 2) ? candidate : null;
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- **Goal:** Achieve fluency in Easy problems.
- **Action:** Daily, solve 2-3 Easy problems on core topics: Array, Hash Table, String. Use a timer. Focus on writing syntactically perfect code on the first try in your chosen language. Re-solve problems you struggled with.

**Weeks 3-4: Intensity on Medium Problems**

- **Goal:** Build speed and pattern recognition for Mediums.
- **Action:** Solve 2 Medium problems daily. Prioritize the top topics from Agoda's list. For each problem, practice aloud: explain the brute force approach, then optimize (often with a Hash Table or two-pointer). Write the code, test with edge cases, then analyze time/space complexity.

**Week 5: Mock Interviews & Weakness Targeting**

- **Action:** Conduct at least 3-4 timed mock interviews (60 minutes, 2 problems). Simulate the real environment: camera on, explain your thinking. Identify weak spots (e.g., Dynamic Programming, specific graph problems) and dedicate a day to drilling that topic.

**Week 6: Final Review & Behavioral Prep**

- **Action:** Re-solve the most frequent Agoda-style problems from your notes. Ensure you can derive the optimal solution quickly. Prepare concise stories for behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about a technical challenge") and have thoughtful questions ready for your interviewers.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Start by restating the problem in your own words. Verbalize every thought, from brute force to optimization. A silent screen is a failing interview.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** For Agoda's mix, a clean, correct O(n log n) solution is almost always better than a buggy, attempted O(n) one. Get a working solution first, then optimize if time permits.
3.  **Master Your Single Language.** Use one language for all practice and the interview. Know its standard library for collections (HashMap, List, Arrays.sort) inside out to avoid wasting time.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring "done," verbally run through tests: empty input, single element, large values, duplicates. Fix any bugs immediately.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before coding, confirm assumptions about input format, return values, and edge case handling. It shows professionalism and prevents solving the wrong problem.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the only shortcut. Understand the patterns, communicate your process, and write clean code.
