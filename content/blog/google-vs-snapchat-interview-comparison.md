When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Google and Snapchat represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of scale and focus, which is directly reflected in their interview question profiles. Google's process is vast, systematic, and algorithmically deep, while Snapchat's is more concentrated, with a stronger emphasis on practical, real-time system considerations. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is sheer volume. Google has a documented **2,217 questions** on TidyBit, dwarfing Snapchat's **99 questions**. This reflects Google's longer interview history, larger hiring scale, and the extensive reporting from candidates.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Google (E588/M1153/H476):** The difficulty spread is relatively balanced, leaning towards Medium. This aligns with Google's reputation for foundational algorithmic challenges. You are expected to solve Medium problems optimally and grapple with Hard problems, often requiring insights beyond standard patterns.
- **Snapchat (E6/M62/H31):** The distribution is heavily skewed towards **Medium and Hard** problems. The low number of Easy questions suggests their interviews quickly move to complex scenarios. Snapchat problems often involve applying algorithms to real-world, stateful systems (like messaging or stories) which inherently increases complexity.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** fundamentals. These are the building blocks for most software engineering problems.

The key divergence is in the next layer of topics:

- **Google's Distinct Focus: Dynamic Programming (DP).** With 476 Hard questions, DP is a significant differentiator. Google frequently tests optimization and combinatorial problems that require a DP state transition. Mastering this is non-negotiable for Google prep.
- **Snapchat's Distinct Focus: Breadth-First Search (BFS).** BFS is central to problems involving shortest paths, level-order traversal, or exploring states in a system (like finding the degree of connection in a social network or the minimum steps in a game). This aligns with Snapchat's domain of networks and feeds.

Here is a classic problem illustrating each company's topical lean:

# Google-style: DP (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
def lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

```javascript
// Google-style: DP (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  if (!nums.length) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return Math.max(...dp);
}
```

```java
// Google-style: DP (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
    int maxAns = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxAns;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Google first**. Here's why: Google's interview is a superset of fundamental algorithmic knowledge. Mastering the core topics (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, DP, Graphs, Trees) to the depth required for Google will make you exceptionally well-prepared for Snapchat's focused problem set. The reverse is not true. Preparing only for Snapchat's high-concentration BFS and system-focused problems may leave gaps in DP and other advanced algorithms critical for Google.

Your preparation path should be: 1) Build a rock-solid foundation using a general LeetCode/TidyBit study plan. 2) Deep-dive into Google's frequent topics, especially Dynamic Programming. 3) Closer to a Snapchat interview, pivot to practicing their specific, often graph/BFS-heavy questions and brush up on system design fundamentals relevant to real-time systems.
