When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution can significantly streamline your study process. Cisco and Atlassian, while both prominent in the tech industry, present distinct profiles in their coding interview question patterns. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Cisco's question bank, with 86 total questions, is notably larger than Atlassian's 62. This suggests a broader potential range of problems you might encounter.

The difficulty distribution reveals their different screening approaches:

- **Cisco:** Easy (22), Medium (49), Hard (15). The majority are Medium-difficulty problems, but the significant number of Hard questions (over 17% of the total) indicates they assess advanced problem-solving and algorithmic optimization.
- **Atlassian:** Easy (7), Medium (43), Hard (12). Atlassian's focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions (nearly 70% of its bank), with a smaller proportion of Easy and Hard problems. This points to a strong emphasis on core, practical problem-solving skills.

In short, Cisco's interview may test a wider spectrum of difficulty, including more challenging problems, while Atlassian's process is heavily centered on solid performance across standard medium-level challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** are top topics for both, forming a crucial common ground for preparation.

Solving problems in these areas often involves standard patterns. For example, a common "Array & Hash Table" problem is finding two numbers that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key difference lies in their secondary focus:

- **Cisco** explicitly lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic. This indicates a higher likelihood of problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or sliding windows.
- **Atlassian** lists **Sorting** as a top topic. This suggests more problems where sorting the input is a critical first step to an efficient solution, or where you need to implement/comprehend a sorting mechanic.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the shared foundation. Mastering **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** manipulations will build a strong base applicable to both companies. Practice medium-difficulty problems from these categories extensively.

If your goal is to interview at both, **prepare for Atlassian first**. The intense focus on Medium problems within the core topics provides an excellent training ground. Achieving consistency here will make you competitive for Atlassian and build the skills needed for the majority of Cisco's questions. You can then layer on specific practice for **Two Pointers** patterns and more **Hard** problems to round out your Cisco preparation.

Ultimately, Atlassian's profile is more concentrated, making it an efficient starting point. Cisco's broader and slightly more difficult range requires extending that core competency with additional pattern recognition and optimization practice.
