When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Yahoo and Twitter, while both established in the web ecosystem, show distinct patterns in their technical interview question profiles. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions and their difficulty spread reveals initial priorities.

Yahoo's profile is defined by a larger volume of overall questions (**64 total**) with a significant emphasis on foundational concepts. Its distribution is heavily weighted toward easier and medium problems: **26 Easy**, **32 Medium**, and only **6 Hard**. This suggests Yahoo's process may focus strongly on core competency and clean implementation, using fewer highly complex algorithmic puzzles. The high volume means breadth of preparation across standard topics is crucial.

Twitter presents a smaller but more challenging set (**53 total**), with a pronounced skew toward medium and hard problems: **8 Easy**, **33 Medium**, and **12 Hard**. The near-identical number of Medium questions to Yahoo is notable, but the significantly higher count of Hard problems indicates Twitter's interviews likely probe deeper into optimization, edge cases, and sophisticated problem-solving under constraints.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test three fundamental data structures: **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Array/String Manipulation:** Expect questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and traversal.
- **Hash Table Usage:** Essential for frequency counting, memoization, and providing O(1) lookups to optimize solutions.

The key differentiator is Twitter's inclusion of **Design** as a top topic. This aligns with Twitter's platform nature, involving real-time systems, data streams, and scalable architecture. Yahoo's list highlights **Sorting**, indicating a stronger focus on algorithms that involve ordering data, comparative analysis, and the properties of sorted arrays (e.g., enabling binary search).

Here’s a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your experience and timeline.

If you are **new to technical interviews or building core fundamentals**, start with **Yahoo**. The larger pool of Easy/Medium questions provides a broader set of practice material to solidify understanding of arrays, hash tables, strings, and sorting algorithms. Succeeding here builds the confidence and pattern recognition needed for more difficult problems.

If you are **already comfortable with standard algorithm problems and are aiming for higher-tier companies**, or if your target role is **Backend, API, or Systems Engineer**, prioritize **Twitter**. The focus on Medium/Hard problems and the explicit Design topic requires advanced practice. You will need to supplement algorithm practice with system design fundamentals (e.g., designing a social media feed, rate limiter, or tinyURL service).

A strategic approach is to begin with the foundational topics common to both—Array, Hash Table, String—using Yahoo's extensive medium-difficulty questions. Once proficient, shift focus to tackling harder problems and studying system design principles to meet Twitter's bar.
