When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. TikTok and Flipkart, while both major tech companies, show distinct differences in their interview question profiles. TikTok's list is significantly larger and broader, reflecting its global social media platform's need for versatile problem-solving. Flipkart's list is more focused, aligning with its e-commerce and systems engineering core. Understanding these differences helps you allocate your preparation time strategically.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. TikTok's list of 383 questions is over three times the size of Flipkart's 117. This doesn't necessarily mean TikTok interviews are harder, but it indicates a wider range of potential problems and a greater emphasis on algorithmic breadth.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** Medium difficulty questions dominate, comprising about 68% of the list. The high number of total questions, especially mediums, suggests interviews often involve working through multiple progressively challenging problems to assess coding speed, adaptability, and depth of knowledge.
- **Flipkart (E13/M73/H31):** The distribution is more balanced proportionally, with Mediums making up about 62% of a much smaller total. The higher ratio of Hard questions (26.5% vs. TikTok's 21%) points to a process that may dive deeper into complex, optimized solutions for fewer problems, possibly reflecting a focus on scalable systems design.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, confirming these as foundational for any interview prep.

- **Array and String (TikTok):** TikTok explicitly lists String as a top topic, which is unsurprising given its text-heavy platform features (captions, comments, search). Expect heavy use of arrays and strings for problems involving sequences, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Sliding Window (common for both)
def max_subarray_sum(nums, k):
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
// Example: Sliding Window (common for both)
function maxSubarraySum(nums, k) {
  let windowSum = nums.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;
  for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
// Example: Sliding Window (common for both)
public int maxSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) windowSum += nums[i];
    int maxSum = windowSum;
    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

</div>

- **Dynamic Programming:** Crucial for both. For TikTok, DP is often applied to string/sequence problems (e.g., edit distance, longest common subsequence). For Flipkart, DP may lean towards optimization problems relevant to logistics, pricing, or inventory systems.
- **Key Difference - Sorting:** Flipkart explicitly lists **Sorting** as a top topic. This highlights a potential focus on data organization, merging datasets, or efficient retrieval—skills critical in e-commerce backends dealing with product catalogs, rankings, and user data.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Flipkart**. Its focused list provides a efficient, high-yield study path. Mastering its core topics—especially the emphasis on Sorting alongside Arrays, DP, and Hash Tables—builds a strong, versatile foundation. Solving a high percentage of Flipkart's 117 questions, including its significant portion of Hards, will develop deep problem-solving skills.

This foundation then makes tackling **TikTok's** vast question bank more manageable. You can approach it as an exercise in broadening your exposure. Use TikTok's list to increase your speed, recognize patterns more quickly, and practice the string manipulation problems that are its distinctive focus. Preparing for Flipkart first gives you depth; adding TikTok prep then gives you breadth.

Ultimately, your priority should be dictated by your interview timeline. But as a general strategy, building from a focused core (Flipkart) out to a broad set (TikTok) is an effective way to structure your study plan.
