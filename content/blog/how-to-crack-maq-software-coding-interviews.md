MAQ Software’s technical interviews are a direct assessment of your problem-solving and coding fundamentals. The process typically involves one or two rounds focused on data structures, algorithms, and database design, with a strong emphasis on writing clean, efficient code. Success hinges on methodical preparation for their favored question types.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, the question difficulty spread is approximately:

- **Easy:** 22% (2 out of 9 questions)
- **Medium:** 56% (5 out of 9 questions)
- **Hard:** 22% (2 out of 9 questions)

This distribution is telling. The majority of your interview will be spent on **Medium-difficulty problems**. These questions test your ability to apply core algorithms to slightly novel situations, optimize beyond brute force, and handle edge cases. The presence of Hard questions means you must be comfortable with advanced patterns, but note they are less frequent. The key takeaway: build a rock-solid foundation in Medium problems across their top topics. If you can confidently solve those, you are in a strong position to handle the occasional Easy or Hard question.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be heavily weighted toward these areas, which dominate MAQ Software's question bank.

- **String:** Expect manipulation, pattern matching, and palindrome problems. Mastering two-pointer and sliding window techniques is essential.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A favorite for medium-hard problems. Focus on core patterns like 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, and Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray.
- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Be prepared for sorting, searching, and subarray problems using techniques like two-pointers and prefix sums.
- **Stack:** Crucial for problems involving matching pairs, parsing, and next-greater-element logic. It's often the optimal solution for "nearest" or "balanced" type questions.
- **Database:** SQL design and querying are consistently tested. Practice writing efficient JOINs, subqueries, and window functions, and be ready to discuss normalization.

For their top topic, **Dynamic Programming**, the most critical pattern to internalize is the **0/1 Knapsack** framework. It forms the basis for many DP problems involving selection with constraints.

```python
def knapsack_01(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Max of excluding or including the item
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]  # Exclude the item
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack_01(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack01(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(
          dp[i - 1][w], // exclude
          values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] // include
        );
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example usage
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack01(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack01 {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(
                        dp[i - 1][w], // exclude
                        values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] // include
                    );
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate this phase to mastering the top five topics. For each topic (Array, String, Stack, DP, Database), spend 2-3 days. Complete 10-15 curated Medium problems per topic. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just memorizing solutions. For Database, practice 5-10 SQL problems covering joins, aggregation, and subqueries daily.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Shift to solving mixed-topic problem sets. This simulates the actual interview where the category isn't given. Prioritize Medium problems. Begin doing timed practice sessions (45-60 minutes per problem) to build speed and stamina. In the final days of this block, start full mock interviews that include a SQL design question.

**Weeks 5-6: Gap Analysis & Final Review**
Identify your weak spots by reviewing incorrect or slow solutions. Revisit the theory and solve more problems in those areas. In the final week, reduce volume and focus on revision. Re-solve key problems from your notes without help. Ensure you can clearly explain your approach and the time/space complexity for every problem you've practiced.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, including a brute-force method and your planned optimization. Interviewers assess your thought process as much as your final answer.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with proper indentation. Write a driver function with a clear example, as shown in the DP code above.
3.  **Don't Ignore SQL.** Many candidates focus only on DSA and fail the database round. Dedicate consistent daily practice to writing and optimizing SQL queries.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** After coding, immediately walk through your solution with small, large, and edge-case inputs (empty arrays, single values, negative numbers). This demonstrates thoroughness.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before solving, confirm assumptions about input format, expected output, and constraints. This prevents you from solving the wrong problem.

Mastering these patterns and executing this focused plan will significantly increase your confidence and performance in the MAQ Software coding interview.
