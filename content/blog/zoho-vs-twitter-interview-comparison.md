When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice but vary significantly in scope and focus. Zoho and Twitter represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of volume and problem-solving style. Zoho's list is extensive and foundational, while Twitter's is more selective and design-oriented. Understanding their differences helps you allocate your preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Zoho's list of 179 questions dwarfs Twitter's 53. This volume suggests Zoho's interviews may involve a broader sweep of algorithmic concepts or that their question bank has accumulated over a longer period.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Zoho (Easy: 62, Medium: 97, Hard: 20):** The heavy skew toward Medium-difficulty problems indicates an interview process that deeply tests core algorithmic competency. The significant number of questions implies you might face a wider variety of problems, requiring both speed and adaptability.
- **Twitter / X (Easy: 8, Medium: 33, Hard: 12):** With over 60% of questions at Medium difficulty and a notable portion (≈23%) at Hard, Twitter's list points toward interviews that probe advanced problem-solving, often under tighter constraints or with more complex follow-ups. The smaller total number suggests a more curated set of challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These form the bedrock of data structure interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key differentiators are the fourth-ranked topics:

- **Zoho: Dynamic Programming (DP).** The presence of DP as a top category signals that Zoho frequently assesses optimization and state-management problems. You must be comfortable with classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, LIS) and translating problems into optimal substructures.
- **Twitter: Design.** This is a critical distinction. Twitter's inclusion of Design highlights its focus on scalable system architecture. While this may refer to Object-Oriented Design (like designing a parking lot), it often points to **System Design** concepts—scaling a service, discussing trade-offs, and designing APIs for high-traffic systems, which is fitting for a social media platform.

Here is a typical problem that might appear for either, followed by a problem highlighting their different focuses:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Common Focus: Hash Table (Two Sum variant)
def find_pair_sums(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Common Focus: Hash Table (Two Sum variant)
function findPairSums(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Common Focus: Hash Table (Two Sum variant)
public int[] findPairSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Zoho Focus: Dynamic Programming (Example: 0/1 Knapsack)
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][w])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
// Twitter Focus: Design (OOD - Simplified Tweet class structure)
class Tweet {
  constructor(id, content, userId) {
    this.id = id;
    this.content = content;
    this.userId = userId;
    this.timestamp = Date.now();
    this.likes = new Set();
  }

  like(userId) {
    this.likes.add(userId);
  }
}
```

```java
// Twitter Focus: Design (OOD - Simplified Tweet class structure)
public class Tweet {
    private long id;
    private String content;
    private long userId;
    private long timestamp;
    private Set<Long> likes;

    public Tweet(long id, String content, long userId) {
        this.id = id;
        this.content = content;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
        this.likes = new HashSet<>();
    }

    public void like(long userId) {
        likes.add(userId);
    }
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Zoho**. Its massive, medium-heavy question list covering core algorithms and Dynamic Programming will build a rigorous foundational skillset. Solving a large portion of these will make you proficient with the patterns that also appear in Twitter's list (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables). Treat Zoho prep as a comprehensive algorithm bootcamp.

Once your core DSA is strong, pivot to **Twitter**. Here, you must layer on two advanced skills:

1.  **Tackling Harder Algorithm Problems:** Practice the Hard questions, focusing on optimization and edge cases.
2.  **System and Object-Oriented Design:** Dedicate significant time to design principles. For System Design, study concepts like data sharding, caching strategies (e.g., Redis), feed generation, and API rate limiting.

In summary, use Zoho's list to build your algorithmic engine, and then refine it with Twitter's focus on high difficulty and scalable design.
