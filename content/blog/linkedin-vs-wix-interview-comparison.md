When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both LinkedIn and Wix, as prominent technology firms, assess candidates on core computer science fundamentals, but their approach, volume, and difficulty distribution differ significantly. This comparison analyzes their technical interview question profiles to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question banks. LinkedIn's list, at 180 questions, is over three times larger than Wix's 56. This suggests a broader potential question pool and a greater emphasis on encountering a wide variety of problem scenarios during their interview process.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their differing hiring bars. LinkedIn's breakdown is **Easy: 26, Medium: 117, Hard: 37**. The heavy skew toward Medium and Hard questions (over 85% combined) indicates that LinkedIn interviews are designed to be challenging, testing not just implementation but optimal solutions and complex problem-solving under pressure.

In contrast, Wix's distribution is **Easy: 16, Medium: 31, Hard: 9**. While Medium questions still form the majority (~55%), the overall balance is more moderate. The presence of a substantial number of Easy questions and fewer Hards suggests that Wix's process may place a stronger initial emphasis on foundational correctness and clarity, though proficiency with medium-difficulty problems remains essential.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the difference in volume, both companies focus intensely on the same core data structures and algorithms. The primary topics for both are:

- **Array & String:** Manipulation, searching, sorting, and sliding window techniques.
- **Hash Table:** For efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving two-sum variants.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** For tree and graph traversal, pathfinding, and backtracking problems.

This overlap is excellent news for candidates. A strong foundation in these areas serves as a dual-purpose toolkit. For example, mastering hash tables is critical for both companies.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (a classic Hash Table problem)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The shared focus on DFS also implies that recursive thinking and tree/graph modeling are important for roles at both companies.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and timeline.

**Start with the shared fundamentals.** Build a rock-solid understanding of Array/String operations, Hash Table applications, and DFS traversal. This core knowledge is non-negotiable for both. Practice a mix of Easy and Medium problems from these topics to ensure fluency.

**If preparing for Wix,** their focused list is an advantage. You can efficiently cover their known question pool after solidifying the basics. Prioritize mastering all Easy and Medium questions, as they constitute the vast majority of their profile. Use the smaller number of Hard questions to stretch your problem-solving skills.

**If preparing for LinkedIn,** you must prepare for breadth and depth. Treat their large question bank as a guide to the _types_ of problems they favor, not a definitive list. Emphasize Medium and Hard problems across the core topics. You need to develop the stamina and adaptability to handle a wider range of challenging scenarios, which often involves combining multiple concepts (e.g., DFS with memoization or hash tables with array indexing).

For a generalist strategy, begin with the common core topics. Once proficient, if you have interviews at both, the rigorous preparation for LinkedIn will more than cover the technical depth needed for Wix. The reverse is not necessarily true.
