When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific profile of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Google and Coupang, while both major tech employers, present vastly different landscapes in terms of interview preparation. Google's process is a well-documented marathon of algorithmic problem-solving, whereas Coupang's, while rigorous, is more focused and manageable in scope. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of available practice material. On platforms like TidyBit, Google's tagged question pool is massive, with over 2,200 questions categorized by difficulty (588 Easy, 1153 Medium, 476 Hard). This reflects Google's long history of a standardized, algorithm-heavy interview process and the vast number of candidates who have documented their experiences. Preparing for Google means bracing for a wide array of potential problems, with a strong emphasis on Medium and Hard-level challenges that test deep algorithmic understanding and optimization.

In stark contrast, Coupang's tagged pool is significantly smaller, around 53 questions (3 Easy, 36 Medium, 14 Hard). This lower volume doesn't imply an easier interview; rather, it indicates a more focused and less publicly exhaustive question bank. The difficulty distribution still centers on Medium problems, which are the core of most technical screens. The smaller pool means you can achieve broader coverage of Coupang's known problem set more quickly, but you must solve each one with high proficiency, as the likelihood of encountering a known variant is higher.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume disparity, there is strong alignment in the fundamental topics tested. Both companies heavily prioritize:

- **Array & String Manipulation:** Mastery of indexing, slicing, and two-pointer techniques is essential.
- **Hash Table:** Proficiency in using hash maps for O(1) lookups to optimize solutions is a universal requirement.
- **Dynamic Programming:** This is a key differentiator for harder problems at both companies.

This core overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both. The difference lies in depth and variation. Google's vast question pool will test these concepts in more intricate, novel, and combined ways. You might see a Hard DP problem that also requires sophisticated string matching. Coupang's questions, while still challenging, may apply these core concepts in a more direct or business-contextual manner.

```python
# Example: Two-pointer technique for a sorted array (common to both)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer technique for a sorted array (common to both)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer technique for a sorted array (common to both)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your strategy should be dictated by your timeline and goals.

If you are interviewing with **Coupang in the near future**, prioritize it first. You can thoroughly master its known question set, ensuring you can solve all Medium and Hard problems optimally. This focused preparation can yield high returns in a shorter timeframe. Use the shared core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) as your study pillars.

If your ultimate target is **Google**, or if you are interviewing with both, you should start with Google-style preparation. The rigorous, broad practice required for Google will inherently cover the technical depth needed for Coupang and most other companies. Solving a wide variety of Medium and Hard problems from Google's pool builds the robust problem-solving muscle that will make Coupang's focused set feel manageable. In essence, preparing for Google first is the more comprehensive, albeit more demanding, foundation.

Regardless of the order, always tailor your final weeks of study to the specific company. For Coupang, drill into their tagged problems. For Google, ensure you are comfortable with problem-solving under time pressure and explaining complex solutions clearly.
