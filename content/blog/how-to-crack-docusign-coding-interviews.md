DocuSign’s coding interviews are a focused test of your ability to solve practical, data-centric problems. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you’ll be asked to write clean, efficient code to manipulate data structures, often simulating real-world scenarios like document processing or validation. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of their most frequent question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 34 DocuSign coding questions reveals a clear profile: **74% are Medium difficulty**, with a smaller mix of Easy (12%) and Hard (15%) problems. This distribution is critical for your strategy.

It means the interview is designed to assess _competent proficiency_, not academic genius. The goal is to reliably solve common, non-trivial problems under time constraints. You won't often face obscure algorithm puzzles, but you must execute on standard patterns with precision and handle edge cases. The high volume of Medium questions suggests they are looking for developers who can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation without needing extensive hand-holding. Your preparation should mirror this: deep mastery of core data structures and patterns is more valuable than a shallow survey of advanced topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a heavy emphasis on a few core areas. Prioritize these.

- **Hash Table (Most Frequent):** The undisputed king. Used for fast lookups, counting frequencies, and deduplication. Essential for any problem involving tracking or matching elements.
- **Array & String:** The fundamental data carriers. Most problems will involve processing, transforming, or comparing sequences of data.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step to enable efficient solutions (like two-pointer techniques) or to organize data for further processing.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The primary graph/tree traversal method for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order processing.

Given the dominance of Hash Tables, the most important pattern to master is **Frequency Counting**. It's the cornerstone for solving anagrams, finding duplicates, and checking permutations.

```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    char_count = {}
    # Count frequency of chars in s
    for ch in s:
        char_count[ch] = char_count.get(ch, 0) + 1

    # Decrement frequency using chars in t
    for ch in t:
        if ch not in char_count or char_count[ch] == 0:
            return False
        char_count[ch] -= 1

    return True
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

  const charCount = new Map();
  // Count frequency of chars in s
  for (const ch of s) {
    charCount.set(ch, (charCount.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
  }

  // Decrement frequency using chars in t
  for (const ch of t) {
    if (!charCount.has(ch) || charCount.get(ch) === 0) {
      return false;
    }
    charCount.set(ch, charCount.get(ch) - 1);
  }

  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    // Count frequency of chars in s
    for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
        charCount.put(ch, charCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
    }

    // Decrement frequency using chars in t
    for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
        if (!charCount.containsKey(ch) || charCount.get(ch) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        charCount.put(ch, charCount.get(ch) - 1);
    }

    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here’s a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Drill **Hash Table** and **Array** problems. Implement frequency counting, two-sum variants, and sliding window techniques.
- Days 8-14: Master **String** manipulation (reversal, parsing, comparison) and **Sorting** algorithms. Understand when to sort as a pre-processing step.

**Weeks 3-4: Patterns & Integration**

- Days 15-21: Study **Breadth-First Search** for grid and tree problems. Practice level-order traversal and shortest path templates.
- Days 22-28: Integrate topics. Solve problems that combine patterns, like using a hash table to optimize a BFS visited set or sorting an array before applying a two-pointer solution.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Review**

- Complete at least 8-10 timed mock interviews focusing on Medium-difficulty problems.
- Re-solve your initial mistakes. Focus on articulating your thought process clearly and writing bug-free code on the first try.

## Key Tips

1.  **Default to Hash Maps.** When you hear a problem, your first mental check should be: "Can a hash table simplify the lookups or tracking here?" It often can.
2.  **Clarify Data Boundaries.** DocuSign problems often involve real-world data like document text or user IDs. Ask about character sets (ASCII/Unicode), input size limits, and expected behavior for null/empty inputs upfront.
3.  **Prioritize Readability Over Cleverness.** Write code as you would in a production codebase. Use clear variable names, extract helper functions for logical steps, and comment on non-obvious logic. A maintainable, correct solution beats a cryptic, optimal one.
4.  **Practice Verbally.** Explain your reasoning out loud while you code, even during solo practice. Interviewers assess your communication as much as your code.
5.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring completion, run through cases like empty strings, single-element arrays, large inputs, and duplicate values. State these tests explicitly.

Mastering these core patterns and executing them cleanly under interview pressure is the most reliable path to success.
