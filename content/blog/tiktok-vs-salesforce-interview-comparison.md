When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both TikTok and Salesforce are prominent names, but their interview landscapes differ significantly in volume, difficulty distribution, and focus. This comparison analyzes their question profiles to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company.

**TikTok** presents a formidable challenge with **383 questions** cataloged. The difficulty distribution (Easy: 42, Medium: 260, Hard: 81) reveals a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems. This suggests that to pass a TikTok interview, you must not only solve problems correctly but also handle complex optimizations and edge cases efficiently. The high volume indicates a rapidly evolving question bank, possibly due to frequent hiring and a desire to reduce question leakage.

**Salesforce**, in contrast, has a more moderate profile with **189 questions**. Its distribution (Easy: 27, Medium: 113, Hard: 49) still leans towards Medium difficulty, but the proportion of Hard questions is slightly lower relative to the total. This points to an interview process that is challenging but potentially more consistent and predictable in its difficulty level year-over-year.

In short, TikTok's interview appears broader and more demanding on paper, requiring deeper preparation across a wider range of problem complexities.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the difference in volume, both companies focus intensely on the same core data structures and algorithms. The top topics are identical:

1.  **Array & String Manipulation:** Fundamental to most coding interviews. Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and in-place transformations.
<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return s
```

```javascript
// Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  const arr = s.split("");
  while (left < right) {
    [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return arr.join("");
}
```

```java
// Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place
public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

</div>

2.  **Hash Table:** Essential for achieving O(1) lookups. Used in frequency counting, memoization, and validating conditions.
3.  **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for harder problems. Both companies test the ability to break down complex problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, DP on strings) into overlapping subproblems.

This significant overlap is excellent news for candidates. A strong foundation in these four areas serves as a dual-purpose toolkit, making you competitive for both interview processes.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and the principle of building from fundamentals to advanced challenges.

If you are interviewing with **both companies**, or if your goal is to build the most robust problem-solving skills, **prepare for TikTok first**. Mastering its larger and more difficult question set will inherently cover the core topics and difficulty level required for Salesforce. Succeeding with TikTok's profile means you will be over-prepared for the algorithmic core of a Salesforce interview, allowing you to then focus on any company-specific nuances like system design or behavioral rounds.

If you are only interviewing at **Salesforce**, you can focus your preparation directly on its question bank. The moderate volume allows for thorough, repeated practice of each problem pattern. Ensure you can solve the Medium problems fluently and understand the common Hard problem archetypes.

Regardless of your target, start with the shared fundamental topics: Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming. Achieve mastery here before branching out into other areas like Graphs or Trees, which may appear less frequently. This core mastery is the most efficient path to success in either interview loop.
