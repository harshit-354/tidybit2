When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns and focus areas can significantly impact your study strategy. Snapchat (Snap) and Intuit represent two distinct tech profiles: a consumer social media platform and a financial software/productivity company. Their interview question banks on TidyBit—99 questions for Snapchat and 71 for Intuit—reveal clear differences in volume, difficulty, and emphasis, despite some common ground.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw volume suggests Snapchat's process may involve a broader or more intensive coding screen. With 99 cataloged questions (Easy 6, Medium 62, Hard 31), Snapchat places a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems. The high proportion of Hard questions (nearly one-third) indicates an interview process that probes for deep algorithmic optimization and handling complex edge cases. This aligns with the performance-critical nature of a real-time messaging and media application.

Intuit's 71 questions (Easy 10, Medium 47, Hard 14) present a moderately challenging but less daunting profile. The distribution is more balanced, with a strong focus on Medium-difficulty problems and a significantly smaller slice of Hard questions. This reflects Intuit's domain, where clarity, correctness, and maintainable logic for business and data processing problems are often prioritized over extreme algorithmic gymnastics. The higher number of Easy questions also suggests some initial screens may be more accessible.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are foundational to most software engineering roles. **Hash Table** is also a shared key topic, essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting—a common need in both user-facing features and data processing.

The primary divergence is in their secondary focus areas:

- **Snapchat** prominently features **Breadth-First Search**. This is logical for a social graph application, where features like finding mutual friends, degrees of connection, or shortest paths in networks are relevant.
- **Intuit** emphasizes **Dynamic Programming**. This aligns with financial and quantitative problem-solving, where optimizing decisions (like tax calculations, resource allocation, or maximizing profit) over sequences or subsets is a common pattern.

This divergence means your practice should branch after covering the common core.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **common core**: master Array, String, and Hash Table problems at the Medium level. This foundation is essential for both.

If you are interviewing with **both companies**, prepare for **Intuit first**. Its question set is smaller and slightly less skewed toward high difficulty. Solidifying the core topics and Dynamic Programming will build a strong base. You can then layer on the additional breadth and depth needed for Snapchat, specifically by intensively practicing Medium/Hard problems and focusing on graph algorithms, particularly BFS and its applications.

If you are targeting only one, let the topic emphasis guide your deep dive: prioritize graph traversal and complex optimization for Snapchat, and DP, system design for data-heavy applications, and clean problem-solving for Intuit.
