When preparing for technical interviews at major companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically increase your efficiency. Walmart Labs and Morgan Stanley, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. This comparison breaks down their patterns to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a significant difference in the breadth of questions you might encounter.

**Walmart Labs** has a much larger known question pool, with **152 questions** cataloged. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium problems: **Easy 22 | Medium 105 | Hard 25**. This suggests their interviews are designed to thoroughly assess core problem-solving skills, with a strong emphasis on questions that require multiple steps and careful implementation. The high number of medium problems means you must be comfortable with a wide variety of standard patterns and their variations.

**Morgan Stanley** has a more focused pool of **53 questions**. The distribution is **Easy 13 | Medium 34 | Hard 6**. While still medium-heavy, the proportion of hard questions is lower, and the total volume is about one-third of Walmart's. This could indicate a more predictable interview loop or a focus on foundational competency over solving a vast array of novel problems. The lower hard count suggests that while advanced topics may appear, they are less of a primary filter.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies concentrate on the same four fundamental data structures and algorithms: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is critical—mastering these areas prepares you for both.

- **Array & String:** Expect manipulations, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and sorting-related logic.
- **Hash Table:** Essential for optimizing lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, pairs, and duplicates.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key topic for both, indicating you must be proficient in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, from classic problems to more applied scenarios.

The shared focus means a strong foundation in these core topics is non-negotiable. You can practice a problem for one company and have it directly apply to the other. Here is a typical example combining Hash Table and Array logic:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) -> [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) -> [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
// Example: twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9) -> [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Morgan Stanley**. Its smaller, more foundational question pool allows you to build and solidify core competencies in the four key topics efficiently. Success here validates that you have the essential algorithmic toolkit. The lower volume makes initial goal-setting more manageable.

Once comfortable with the core topics, transition to **Walmart Labs**. Use its extensive medium-question bank as a rigorous training ground. The high number of problems will expose you to more variations, edge cases, and complex integrations of the same fundamental concepts. This deep, broad practice will sharpen your speed and adaptability, which is crucial for tackling Walmart's interview and will only make you stronger for any subsequent interview, including Morgan Stanley's.

In short: use Morgan Stanley's focused list to build your foundation, then use Walmart Labs' expansive list for advanced conditioning and breadth.
