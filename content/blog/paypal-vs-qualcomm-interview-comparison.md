When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. PayPal and Qualcomm, while both major tech employers, have distinct interview profiles rooted in their core business domains—financial services versus semiconductor and telecommunications. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you tailor your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in the scale and challenge of their interview question pools.

PayPal's list is significantly larger, with **106 questions** categorized as Easy (18), Medium (69), and Hard (19). This high volume, coupled with a heavy skew toward Medium difficulty, suggests a rigorous, breadth-focused interview process. You must be prepared for a wide variety of problems, with the expectation that you can consistently solve medium-level challenges under pressure.

Qualcomm's list is more compact at **56 questions**, with a difficulty distribution of Easy (25), Medium (22), and Hard (9). The higher proportion of Easy questions and smaller overall pool indicates an interview that may test fundamental competency more deeply on a narrower set of concepts, rather than aiming for sheer breadth. The focus is likely on clean, correct solutions to well-established problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, but with different secondary focuses.

**Shared Core Topics:** `Array` and `String` manipulation are fundamental for both. You must be proficient in iterating, searching, and transforming these structures.

**PayPal's Emphasis:** PayPal's top topics are `Array`, `String`, `Hash Table`, and `Sorting`. The prominence of `Hash Table` and `Sorting` points toward a strong focus on problems involving data lookup, organization, and efficiency—key concerns in transaction and data processing systems. Expect many problems on grouping, counting, and finding unique or duplicate elements.

**Qualcomm's Emphasis:** Qualcomm's key topics are `Array`, `Two Pointers`, `String`, and `Math`. The inclusion of `Two Pointers` and `Math` is telling. It suggests a focus on algorithms dealing with sequences, intervals, and numerical or bitwise operations, which are common in low-level systems, signal processing, or embedded contexts. Problems may involve in-place array manipulation or mathematical reasoning.

Here is a typical "Two Pointers" problem relevant to Qualcomm's focus:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your timeline, strengths, and target.

**Prepare for PayPal first if:** You have more time to build broad, medium-difficulty problem-solving skills. The large question bank requires a longer, more systematic study plan to cover the variety of topics, especially hash table and sorting patterns. Use it as a goal to achieve general interview readiness.

**Prepare for Qualcomm first if:** You are on a tighter schedule or want to solidify fundamentals. The smaller, slightly easier question set allows for deep mastery of core topics like array manipulation with two pointers and basic math. Succeeding here can build confidence before tackling a wider set of problems.

In practice, mastering the core topics of `Array`, `String`, and problem-solving patterns will benefit you for both. Start with the company whose profile best matches your current skill level or immediate interview schedule.
