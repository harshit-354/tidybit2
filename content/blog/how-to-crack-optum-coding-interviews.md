Optum’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. Typically, candidates face a single round focused on data structures and algorithms, often conducted via a platform like HackerRank. The questions are grounded in real-world scenarios, testing your ability to write clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints. Understanding the specific distribution of topics and difficulty is your first strategic advantage.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: **5 questions total, with 2 Easy (40%) and 3 Medium (60%) problems. There are no Hard questions.** This breakdown is critical for your preparation mindset.

It means Optum prioritizes **consistency and foundational mastery** over solving esoteric, complex puzzles. You cannot afford to stumble on Easy problems; they are your baseline for passing. The Medium questions are the true differentiator—they test if you can apply standard patterns to slightly more involved scenarios. The absence of Hard problems suggests that deeply optimized, multi-step algorithmic ingenuity is less important than demonstrating robust, working solutions for common challenges. Your goal is to ace all Easy and at least 2 of the 3 Medium problems.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are String, Dynamic Programming, Array, Two Pointers, and Stack. You should allocate your study time accordingly.

- **String:** Expect manipulations, parsing, and validation. A core pattern is using a hash map for character counting.
- **Dynamic Programming:** This is often the cornerstone of Medium problems. The key is recognizing overlapping subproblems. The "Fibonacci-style" memoization pattern is fundamental.
- **Array:** Questions range from traversal to in-place modifications. The "Prefix Sum" or "Sliding Window" patterns are highly applicable.
- **Two Pointers:** Essential for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings efficiently, such as finding pairs or removing duplicates.
- **Stack:** Used for parsing, validation (like parentheses), and "next greater element" problems.

For Optum, **Dynamic Programming** is frequently the make-or-break topic for Medium questions. Mastering a basic DP pattern is non-negotiable. Here is the classic Fibonacci sequence implementation using memoization, a pattern that extends to many Optum problems:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        return fib(n, new HashMap<>());
    }

    private int fib(int n, HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo) {
        if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
        if (n <= 2) return 1;
        int val = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
        memo.put(n, val);
        return val;
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key. Here is a week-by-week plan:

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Focus on Easy problems from the top topics: String and Array. Complete 15-20 problems. Ensure you can solve any Easy problem within 15 minutes without bugs.
- **Week 3: Core Patterns.** Dive into Medium problems for Two Pointers and Stack. Practice 10-15 problems. Build pattern recognition—when you see a "sorted array" think Two Pointers; for "nested validation" think Stack.
- **Week 4: Dynamic Programming Deep Dive.** This is your most important week. Start with the memoization pattern above, then practice classic problems like Climbing Stairs, Coin Change, and Longest Common Subsequence. Solve at least 10 DP problems.
- **Week 5: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Mix all topics. Solve 2-3 Medium problems in a 60-minute session to simulate the real interview. Use a platform with a timer.
- **Week 6: Refinement & Review.** Revisit mistakes. Practice explaining your code out loud. Focus on clarity and edge cases.

## Key Tips

1.  **Write Code from Scratch Every Time.** Do not just read solutions. Type out every solution during practice to build muscle memory and speed.
2.  **Communicate Your Process.** In the interview, think out loud. Explain your approach, why you chose it, and discuss time/space complexity before you start coding.
3.  **Prioritize a Working Solution Over a Perfect One.** Given the difficulty mix, it's better to have a complete, brute-force solution than an incomplete optimal one. You can often optimize later if time permits.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring done, test your code with empty inputs, single elements, large values, and negative numbers. This shows thoroughness.

Success in Optum's interview comes from methodical preparation on their high-probability topics and demonstrating consistent, clean coding under pressure.
