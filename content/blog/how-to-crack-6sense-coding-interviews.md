## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: 6sense interviews are dominated by medium-difficulty problems (86%), with a single hard problem (14%) and no easy questions. This tells you two things. First, they expect strong foundational competency—you won't be wasting time on trivial array traversals. Second, they are testing for problem-solving under pressure on non-trivial, yet standard, algorithmic challenges. The hard problem is likely a tie-breaker or a test for senior roles. Your preparation must be aimed squarely at the medium tier, ensuring you can cleanly solve problems involving combinations of core concepts like arrays, dynamic programming, and binary search within 30-40 minutes.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Array & Prefix Sum:** Fundamental to most data manipulation. Mastering prefix sum transforms many problems involving subarray sums into constant-time operations.
**Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical topic for medium problems. The key is recognizing overlapping subproblems—often when a problem asks for a "maximum/minimum count" or "number of ways" and has a recursive structure.
**Binary Search:** Not just for searching sorted arrays. Its application in "searching for a solution" in a monotonic answer space is common in medium problems (e.g., "find the minimum capacity to ship packages in D days").
**Greedy:** Often paired with sorting or heap usage. The pattern involves making the locally optimal choice at each step to reach a globally optimal solution, common in scheduling or interval problems.

The most important pattern to master is **Prefix Sum**, as it's a building block for more complex array and DP problems. Here is a classic example: finding the sum of any subarray in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

<div class="code-group">

```python
class PrefixSum:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.prefix = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.prefix[i + 1] = self.prefix[i] + nums[i]

    def range_sum(self, left, right):
        # left and right are 0-indexed, inclusive
        return self.prefix[right + 1] - self.prefix[left]

# Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ps = PrefixSum(nums)
print(ps.range_sum(1, 3))  # Output: 9 (2+3+4)
```

```javascript
class PrefixSum {
  constructor(nums) {
    this.prefix = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      this.prefix[i + 1] = this.prefix[i] + nums[i];
    }
  }

  rangeSum(left, right) {
    // left and right are 0-indexed, inclusive
    return this.prefix[right + 1] - this.prefix[left];
  }
}

// Usage
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const ps = new PrefixSum(nums);
console.log(ps.rangeSum(1, 3)); // Output: 9
```

```java
class PrefixSum {
    private int[] prefix;

    public PrefixSum(int[] nums) {
        prefix = new int[nums.length + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
        }
    }

    public int rangeSum(int left, int right) {
        // left and right are 0-indexed, inclusive
        return prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left];
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        PrefixSum ps = new PrefixSum(nums);
        System.out.println(ps.rangeSum(1, 3)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Spend 5-7 days on arrays, focusing on two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and prefix sum. Dedicate the next 7 days to dynamic programming. Start with 1D DP (Fibonacci, climbing stairs) and move to 2D DP (knapsack, longest common subsequence). Solve at least 15 medium problems per topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Secondary Topics & Integration.** Week 3: Master binary search applications, both standard and on answer spaces (like "capacity to ship packages"). Week 4: Focus on greedy algorithms, often involving sorting intervals or using heaps. In this phase, start mixing topics. Solve problems that combine arrays with DP or binary search with greedy.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Company-Specific Practice.** In the final stretch, conduct at least 8-10 timed mock interviews (50-60 minutes each). Simulate the actual environment. Use the last 3-4 days to solve only 6sense-tagged problems on platforms like TidyBit. This acclimatizes you to their specific problem style and difficulty curve.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Medium Problems First.** Your primary goal is to flawlessly solve medium problems. Practice until you can identify the pattern (e.g., "this is a prefix sum problem") within 5 minutes and code a bug-free solution in 25.
2.  **Communicate Your DP State.** When solving dynamic programming problems, verbally define your `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` table before coding. Say, "Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum profit up to day `i`." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Validate Binary Search Boundaries.** A common pitfall. Before coding, explicitly state your search space `[low, high]` and your loop condition (`while low < high` vs `while low <= high`). Write a comment for the invariant.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases Immediately.** After writing your solution, don't just run the given example. Immediately test empty arrays, single-element arrays, large values, and negative numbers. State these checks to your interviewer.

Master these patterns, follow the focused plan, and you'll be prepared to handle their problem distribution effectively.
