Math matters at Citadel because the firm’s core business—quantitative trading and investment—is built on mathematical models. Every trading strategy, risk assessment, and algorithmic decision relies on probability, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra. The 15 math questions in their interview process (out of 96 total) are designed to filter for candidates who possess not just computational skill, but the analytical rigor and numerical intuition required to solve real-world financial problems under pressure. Success here signals you can think precisely about uncertainty, optimization, and data—exactly what a quant role demands.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

The math section typically avoids advanced theorems, focusing instead on applied problems that test foundational understanding and quick, accurate calculation. Expect these categories:

- **Probability & Statistics:** Coin flips, dice rolls, card draws, expected value, conditional probability, and basic distributions (especially binomial and normal). Questions often involve multi-step reasoning, like “What’s the probability of getting at least three heads in five flips of a biased coin?”
- **Calculus & Optimization:** Derivatives, integrals, and finding maxima/minima. You might optimize a simple profit function or compute a rate of change. Questions are often set in a financial context (e.g., maximizing portfolio return under a constraint).
- **Linear Algebra:** Matrix operations, determinants, eigenvalues, and solving systems of equations. These can appear in problems about Markov chains, portfolio variance, or data transformations.
- **Brainteasers & Mental Math:** Quick estimation, order-of-magnitude calculations, and logic puzzles (e.g., “How many golf balls fit in a school bus?”). These assess your numerical fluency and ability to simplify complex problems.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Review undergraduate-level probability, calculus, and linear algebra. Practice mental arithmetic daily. Work through problems manually first, then use code to verify your answers or simulate probabilistic scenarios. A key pattern is using **combinatorics and simulation** to solve probability questions—this demonstrates both mathematical and programming skill.

For example, a classic problem: “Flip a fair coin until you get two heads in a row. What is the expected number of flips?” You can solve this analytically with a Markov chain, but coding a simulation provides a tangible check.

```python
import random

def simulate_expected_flips(trials=100000):
    total_flips = 0
    for _ in range(trials):
        flips = 0
        consecutive_heads = 0
        while consecutive_heads < 2:
            flips += 1
            if random.random() < 0.5:  # fair coin
                consecutive_heads += 1
            else:
                consecutive_heads = 0
        total_flips += flips
    return total_flips / trials

print(simulate_expected_flips())  # Outputs ~6.0
```

```javascript
function simulateExpectedFlips(trials = 100000) {
  let totalFlips = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < trials; i++) {
    let flips = 0;
    let consecutiveHeads = 0;
    while (consecutiveHeads < 2) {
      flips++;
      if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        consecutiveHeads++;
      } else {
        consecutiveHeads = 0;
      }
    }
    totalFlips += flips;
  }
  return totalFlips / trials;
}

console.log(simulateExpectedFlips()); // Outputs ~6.0
```

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class ExpectedFlips {
    public static double simulateExpectedFlips(int trials) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        long totalFlips = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < trials; i++) {
            int flips = 0;
            int consecutiveHeads = 0;
            while (consecutiveHeads < 2) {
                flips++;
                if (rand.nextDouble() < 0.5) {
                    consecutiveHeads++;
                } else {
                    consecutiveHeads = 0;
                }
            }
            totalFlips += flips;
        }
        return (double) totalFlips / trials;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(simulateExpectedFlips(100000)); // Outputs ~6.0
    }
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Foundations:** Revisit probability rules (Bayes’ theorem, independence, expectation), single-variable calculus, and matrix multiplication. Use textbooks or online notes.
2.  **Drill Problems:** Solve timed sets of probability puzzles and mental math questions. Sites like TidyBit offer company-specific math practice.
3.  **Simulation Practice:** For complex probability questions, implement simulations as shown above. This reinforces concepts and provides a verification tool.
4.  **Mock Interviews:** Practice explaining your reasoning aloud while solving problems. Citadel assesses clarity of thought under time constraints.
