When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide valuable insight into what to expect. Microsoft and Yandex, as major tech players in their respective regions, have distinct interview profiles. A comparison of their question sets on TidyBit reveals clear differences in scale, difficulty distribution, and focus, which should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of questions.

**Microsoft** has a massive bank of **1,352 questions**, categorized by difficulty as Easy (379), Medium (762), and Hard (211). This large pool reflects Microsoft's long history, vast number of roles, and global hiring scale across many product divisions. The distribution is typical for a large tech firm, with a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which form the core of most on-site interviews.

**Yandex** has a significantly smaller, more curated bank of **134 questions**: Easy (52), Medium (72), and Hard (10). This smaller set likely represents a more focused selection of problems that are highly characteristic of Yandex's interview process. The difficulty distribution is similar, with a majority of Medium questions, but the number of Hard problems is relatively minimal.

This volume difference means that for Microsoft, you are practicing within a broad ecosystem of potential problems, while for Yandex, you can aim for more complete coverage of their known question set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with subtle differences in priority.

The top topics for **Microsoft** are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The inclusion of DP as a top-tier topic is significant. Microsoft interviews often delve into optimization and complex problem-solving, where DP is a key tool for medium to hard challenges.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

The top topics for **Yandex** are **Array, Hash Table, String, and Two Pointers**. The prominence of **Two Pointers** over DP is notable. This suggests Yandex interviews may place a higher relative weight on efficient array/string manipulation and in-place algorithms, which are common in medium-difficulty problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

The strong core overlap (Array, String, Hash Table) means foundational preparation serves both. The key differentiator is the fourth topic: prioritize DP for Microsoft and Two Pointers for Yandex.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your target company dictates the approach. However, if you are preparing for both or for general interview fitness, **start with the Yandex question set**.

Mastering the smaller, focused Yandex bank will efficiently solidify your skills in the three shared fundamental topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and the important Two Pointers technique. This provides a strong, broad foundation. Once this core is solid, transitioning to Microsoft preparation involves scaling up to a larger volume of practice and diving deeper into advanced topics like Dynamic Programming. The Microsoft set will then test your endurance and ability to apply fundamentals to more complex, optimized solutions.

In essence, Yandex's list is an excellent concentrated curriculum. Microsoft's list is the expansive training ground that follows.
