When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Infosys and Intuit represent two distinct segments of the tech industry—global IT services and financial software—leading to different interview focuses. This comparison analyzes their question banks on TidyBit to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant difference in both the number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

Infosys has a larger question bank with **158 questions**, broken down as Easy (42), Medium (82), and Hard (34). This higher volume, especially in Medium and Hard categories, suggests a broader and potentially more rigorous screening process. Candidates can expect a wider range of problem-solving scenarios, requiring strong fundamentals to handle the variety.

Intuit's question bank is smaller at **71 questions**, with a distribution of Easy (10), Medium (47), and Hard (14). The emphasis is clearly on Medium-difficulty problems. This indicates an interview process that deeply tests core competency and applied problem-solving skills, rather than overwhelming breadth or extreme algorithmic complexity.

**Key Takeaway:** Infosys interviews may test a wider net of concepts, while Intuit interviews focus on depth within a more curated set of challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize foundational data structures and algorithms, but with a notable difference in one key area.

**Shared Core Topics:**

- **Array:** Fundamental manipulation, searching, and sorting.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Problems involving optimization and overlapping subproblems.
- **String:** Common operations, pattern matching, and transformations.

These shared topics form the bedrock of both interview processes. A problem like finding the longest palindromic substring or the maximum subarray sum could appear at either company.

**Divergence:**
The most significant difference is Intuit's inclusion of **Hash Table** as a top topic, which is absent from Infosys's listed top four. This points to Intuit's focus on problems involving efficient lookups, frequency counting, and data association—skills highly relevant for financial data processing and user account management.

```python
# Example Hash Table problem: Two Sum (common at Intuit)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example Dynamic Programming problem (common at both)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example Hash Table problem: Two Sum (common at Intuit)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example Dynamic Programming problem (common at both)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example Hash Table problem: Two Sum (common at Intuit)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example Dynamic Programming problem (common at both)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and the foundational strength required.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are building broad, generalist problem-solving skills. The larger question bank with more Hard problems provides a comprehensive workout. Mastering this scope will make other interviews feel more manageable. Solidify the core topics (Array, DP, String, Math) thoroughly.

**Prepare for Intuit first if:** You are targeting software roles in data-intensive or product-focused companies. The concentrated set of Medium problems on core topics, plus the specific emphasis on Hash Tables, allows for deep, focused practice. This is an efficient path to building strong, applicable skills for similar tech companies.

**Optimal Strategy:** Start with the shared core of Array, Dynamic Programming, and String problems at a Medium difficulty level. This builds a versatile foundation. Then, branch based on your target: add extensive practice across difficulties for Infosys, or double down on Hash Table mastery and medium-depth problems for Intuit.
