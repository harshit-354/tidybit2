Nike’s technical interviews are designed to assess problem-solving skills and engineering fundamentals, mirroring the data-driven and innovative approach of the brand itself. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live collaborative editor. Questions are practical and test your ability to write clean, efficient code under constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Nike’s recent coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 23% Easy, 62% Medium, and 15% Hard. This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy. The heavy weighting toward Medium-difficulty problems means you must build consistent, reliable proficiency. You won't advance by only solving easy problems, nor should you spend all your time on esoteric hard problems. The goal is to master the core patterns that appear in Medium-tier questions—these are the gatekeepers to an offer. The presence of Hard questions (15%) indicates you may face one complex problem, often testing advanced dynamic programming or a tricky combination of techniques, so you need depth in addition to breadth.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these five high-frequency topics.

**Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect questions on in-place manipulations, subarray sums, and matrix traversals. Master the prefix sum and sliding window patterns for efficient solutions.

**Dynamic Programming (DP):** A major differentiator in interviews. Nike's problems often involve optimization—think maximizing value, minimizing cost, or counting ways. Start with classic problems like knapsack, longest increasing subsequence, and coin change to build intuition.

**String:** Closely tied to array problems. Common themes include palindrome checks, anagrams, and string transformations. Two pointers and hash maps are your primary tools here.

**Two Pointers:** An essential technique for optimizing array and string problems from O(n²) to O(n). Use it for sorted array pair sums, removing duplicates, or palindrome validation.

**Stack:** Crucial for parsing, validation, and next-greater-element problems. If you see problems involving matching parentheses, nested structures, or monotonic requirements, think stack.

Given that **Array** and **Two Pointers** are top topics, the sliding window pattern is a quintessential example you must know. It's used for problems like "find the longest substring with at most K distinct characters" or "maximum sum subarray of size K."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray_of_size_k(arr, k):
    """Returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(arr) < k:
        return -1
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum = window_sum + arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarrayOfSizeK(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return -1;
  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;
  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum + arr[i] - arr[i - k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int maxSumSubarrayOfSizeK(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length < k) return -1;
        int windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        int maxSum = windowSum;
        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum + arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is non-negotiable. Here is a focused, four-week schedule. Extend to six weeks if you need more practice.

**Week 1: Foundation & Core Patterns.** Dedicate this week to Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers. Solve 15-20 problems, focusing on techniques like sliding window, prefix sum, and in-place operations. Use online judge platforms to time yourself.

**Week 2: Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms.** Target Dynamic Programming and Stack. For DP, start with 1D problems (Fibonacci, coin change) before moving to 2D (knapsack, LCS). For Stack, practice problems like valid parentheses, daily temperatures, and asteroid collision.

**Week 3: Topic Integration & Mock Interviews.** Solve Medium problems that combine topics, such as a DP problem on a string or a two-pointer problem with a hash map. Begin taking timed mock interviews that include a Nike-style question. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly.

**Week 4: Refinement & Hard Problems.** Revisit weak areas. Attempt 3-4 Hard problems to stretch your thinking, particularly in DP. In the final days, review your code from earlier weeks—clean up solutions, ensure you understand time/space complexity, and practice writing bug-free code quickly.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** Always explain your approach, discuss trade-offs, and mention edge cases before writing a single line of code. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving process as much as the final solution.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** Start with a brute-force solution if necessary, but immediately state its inefficiency. Then, logically walk through the optimization steps (e.g., "We can improve this from O(n²) to O(n log n) by using a hash map").
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through small, large, empty, and invalid inputs. This shows attention to detail and prevents simple oversights.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language Inside Out.** Be prepared to explain the time complexity of built-in operations (e.g., `list.insert(0, x)` in Python is O(n)). Write idiomatic, clean code.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Never assume. If a problem statement says "subarray," confirm if it must be contiguous. If it involves a "string," ask about character set (ASCII/Unicode) and case sensitivity.

Mastering these patterns and executing this plan will build the muscle memory needed to perform under pressure. The goal is to make solving a Medium problem feel routine.
