Mercari’s coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving and clean code. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you’ll be asked to solve algorithmic problems on a shared editor, followed by discussions on your approach and potential optimizations. The emphasis is on clarity, communication, and the ability to translate a real-world scenario into efficient code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Mercari's coding questions break down as follows: 60% Easy, 40% Medium, and 0% Hard. This distribution is a critical insight for your preparation. It means the interview is less about solving obscure, complex graph problems under extreme time pressure and more about demonstrating **foundational mastery and bug-free implementation**.

The absence of Hard problems signals that interviewers prioritize your ability to correctly and efficiently solve common problems over tackling brain-teasers. You will be expected to handle Easy questions quickly and flawlessly, leaving ample time to thoughtfully work through the Medium problems. The key to success here is consistency and accuracy, not advanced algorithm knowledge.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Math, Greedy, Hash Table, and String. You should be able to recognize and implement standard patterns for these in your sleep.

- **Array:** The cornerstone. Expect manipulations, in-place operations, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulating a mathematical process.
- **Greedy:** Problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global solution. The challenge is proving (or at least arguing) why the greedy approach works.
- **Hash Table:** Your go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity, frequently paired with Array or String problems.
- **String:** Closely related to Array problems, often involving parsing, comparison, or sliding window techniques.

A quintessential pattern that combines Array and Hash Table is the **"Two-Sum"** approach—using a hash map to store seen elements for instant complement lookup. This is fundamental for many problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill the top five topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Math, Greedy). For each, solve 10-15 classic problems on TidyBit, starting with Easy and moving to Medium. Focus on writing syntactically perfect code on the first try. Implement key patterns like two-pointers (Array), sliding window (String), and the hash map complement lookup multiple times.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Speed.** Start solving mixed-topic Medium problems. Time yourself. The goal is to identify the correct pattern (e.g., "this is a Greedy sorting problem with an Array") within 2-3 minutes. Practice explaining your reasoning out loud as you solve, mimicking the interview. Complete at least 30 Medium problems in this phase.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Mercari-Specific Prep.** Conduct 2-3 mock interviews focusing on the Mercari difficulty profile (no Hard problems). Use the TidyBit Mercari question list. Prioritize clarity and communication. In the final days, review and re-solve any problems you previously found challenging from the top topics.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** With no Hard problems, a brute-force solution that works is often better than an optimal one with bugs. Start with a working solution, then optimize if asked.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Always restate the problem in your own words and walk through a small example. Outline your approach, including data structure choices (e.g., "I'll use a hash map to store indices for O(1) lookups"), before writing any code.
3.  **Master In-Place Array Operations.** Many Easy/Medium Array problems ask for O(1) space. Be proficient with two-pointer techniques for tasks like partitioning, removal, or merging sorted arrays.
4.  **Test Your Code Verbally.** After writing, don't just say "done." Walk through your code with a test case, including edge cases (empty input, large values, negative numbers). This demonstrates thoroughness.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** For a problem like "find the maximum profit," immediately ask: Can numbers be negative? Is the array sorted? What should I return if no solution exists? This shows analytical thinking.

Success in Mercari's interviews comes from a solid grasp of fundamentals, clean coding habits, and clear communication. Target the high-frequency topics, practice under timed conditions, and you'll be well-prepared.
