# Sweep Line Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Sweep Line is a geometric algorithm pattern that solves problems by imagining a line sweeping across a plane, processing events as it encounters points or intervals. In coding interviews, it’s a powerful technique for tackling problems involving intervals, overlaps, and ordering in one or two dimensions. While less common than patterns like Two Pointers or Sliding Window, Sweep Line appears disproportionately in hard problems at top tech companies. Mastering it signals strong algorithmic thinking and can be the key to solving challenging interview questions.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Interval Overlap Checking

This pattern involves sorting interval start and end points, then sweeping through them while tracking active intervals. It’s used for problems like merging intervals, finding maximum overlap, or checking for conflicts.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    events = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        events.append((start, 1))   # start event
        events.append((end, -1))    # end event

    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))

    merged = []
    count = 0
    curr_start = None

    for time, event_type in events:
        if count == 0:
            curr_start = time
        count += event_type
        if count == 0:
            merged.append([curr_start, time])

    return merged
```

```javascript
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  const events = [];
  for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
    events.push([start, 1]);
    events.push([end, -1]);
  }

  events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || b[1] - a[1]);

  const merged = [];
  let count = 0;
  let currStart = null;

  for (const [time, type] of events) {
    if (count === 0) {
      currStart = time;
    }
    count += type;
    if (count === 0) {
      merged.push([currStart, time]);
    }
  }

  return merged;
}
```

```java
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        events.add(new int[]{interval[0], 1});
        events.add(new int[]{interval[1], -1});
    }

    events.sort((a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);

    List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
    int count = 0;
    int currStart = 0;

    for (int[] event : events) {
        if (count == 0) {
            currStart = event[0];
        }
        count += event[1];
        if (count == 0) {
            merged.add(new int[]{currStart, event[0]});
        }
    }

    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

### 2. Skyline Problem Pattern

The classic Skyline problem uses Sweep Line to track building heights as we sweep from left to right, maintaining the current maximum height.

### 3. Calendar and Scheduling

For problems like meeting rooms or event scheduling, we sweep through time points while tracking resource usage (like rooms or employees).

<div class="code-group">

```python
def min_meeting_rooms(intervals):
    events = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        events.append((start, 1))
        events.append((end, -1))

    events.sort()

    rooms = 0
    max_rooms = 0

    for _, change in events:
        rooms += change
        max_rooms = max(max_rooms, rooms)

    return max_rooms
```

```javascript
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  const events = [];
  for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
    events.push([start, 1]);
    events.push([end, -1]);
  }

  events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  let rooms = 0;
  let maxRooms = 0;

  for (const [_, change] of events) {
    rooms += change;
    maxRooms = Math.max(maxRooms, rooms);
  }

  return maxRooms;
}
```

```java
public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
    List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        events.add(new int[]{interval[0], 1});
        events.add(new int[]{interval[1], -1});
    }

    events.sort((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

    int rooms = 0;
    int maxRooms = 0;

    for (int[] event : events) {
        rooms += event[1];
        maxRooms = Math.max(maxRooms, rooms);
    }

    return maxRooms;
}
```

</div>

## Difficulty Breakdown

Sweep Line questions skew heavily toward hard difficulty: 83% hard (5 questions), 17% medium (1 question), and 0% easy. This distribution reveals important insights:

1. **Sweep Line tests advanced problem-solving** – Companies use it to distinguish top candidates who can handle complex spatial/temporal reasoning.
2. **It's often a "second layer" solution** – Many problems can be solved with brute force O(n²), but Sweep Line provides the optimal O(n log n) solution.
3. **Pattern recognition is crucial** – Since these are hard problems, recognizing the Sweep Line pattern early saves valuable interview time.

The single medium question typically involves a straightforward interval overlap problem, while hard questions add dimensions (like 2D plane problems) or require maintaining complex state during the sweep.

## Which Companies Ask Sweep Line

Top companies that frequently ask Sweep Line questions include:

- [Google](/company/google) – Known for geometric and interval problems
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – Often in logistics and scheduling contexts
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – Financial data and time series applications
- [Meta](/company/meta) – Calendar and event scheduling systems
- [Apple](/company/apple) – UI rendering and calendar features

These companies value Sweep Line because it demonstrates:

- Ability to think spatially/geometrically
- Skill in reducing problem complexity through sorting and event processing
- Understanding of time/space tradeoffs in algorithm design

## Study Tips

1. **Master the event sorting approach** – Always sort events by time/position, and when times are equal, process end events before start events (or vice versa depending on problem requirements).

2. **Practice interval transformations** – Convert every interval problem into a list of (time, event_type) pairs. This mental transformation is key to recognizing Sweep Line opportunities.

3. **Track state with appropriate data structures** – Use simple counters for basic overlap, but be prepared to use heaps (for tracking max values) or trees (for ordered maintenance) in more complex problems.

4. **Start with classic problems** – Solve the Skyline problem, Meeting Rooms II, and Merge Intervals multiple times until the pattern becomes automatic. These form the foundation for variations.

Sweep Line questions are challenging but conquerable with focused practice. The pattern is consistent once recognized, and implementing it efficiently demonstrates strong algorithmic competency.
