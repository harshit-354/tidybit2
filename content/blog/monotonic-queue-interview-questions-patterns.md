# Monotonic Queue Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Monotonic queues are a specialized data structure that maintains elements in strictly increasing or decreasing order while supporting efficient addition and removal from both ends. In coding interviews, they are a secret weapon for solving sliding window problems requiring O(n) time—where a naive approach might be O(n²). Mastering this pattern can turn a hard dynamic programming or array problem into a manageable one, especially at top tech companies where algorithmic efficiency is non-negotiable.

## Common Patterns

Monotonic queues typically solve problems involving finding maximum/minimum values in a sliding window or maintaining a monotonic sequence for next-greater-element calculations. Here are the core patterns.

### 1. Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum

This is the most frequent application. You maintain a deque where elements are stored in decreasing order for maximum (or increasing for minimum). As the window slides, you remove elements outside the window from the front and maintain monotonicity by popping from the back when adding new elements.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    from collections import deque
    dq = deque()
    res = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Remove indices outside the window
        if dq and dq[0] == i - k:
            dq.popleft()
        # Maintain decreasing order
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] <= num:
            dq.pop()
        dq.append(i)
        # Record max once window is fully formed
        if i >= k - 1:
            res.append(nums[dq[0]])
    return res
```

```javascript
function maxSlidingWindow(nums, k) {
  const dq = [];
  const res = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Remove indices outside the window
    if (dq.length && dq[0] === i - k) dq.shift();
    // Maintain decreasing order
    while (dq.length && nums[dq[dq.length - 1]] <= nums[i]) dq.pop();
    dq.push(i);
    // Record max once window is fully formed
    if (i >= k - 1) res.push(nums[dq[0]]);
  }
  return res;
}
```

```java
public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
    Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
    int[] res = new int[nums.length - k + 1];
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Remove indices outside the window
        if (!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekFirst() == i - k) dq.pollFirst();
        // Maintain decreasing order
        while (!dq.isEmpty() && nums[dq.peekLast()] <= nums[i]) dq.pollLast();
        dq.offerLast(i);
        // Record max once window is fully formed
        if (i >= k - 1) res[idx++] = nums[dq.peekFirst()];
    }
    return res;
}
```

</div>

### 2. Next Greater Element

For each element, find the next element in the array that is greater. A monotonic decreasing stack (which behaves like a queue in this traversal) efficiently tracks candidates.

### 3. Constrained Subsequence Sum or Dynamic Programming Optimization

Monotonic queues can optimize DP transitions where you take the best previous result within a sliding window constraint, commonly seen in problems like "Constrained Subsequence Sum."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k):
    from collections import deque
    dq = deque()
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove best index if it's outside the window of size k
        if dq and dq[0] < i - k:
            dq.popleft()
        # dp[i] is current max (take previous best + nums[i] or start fresh)
        dp[i] = nums[i] + (dp[dq[0]] if dq else 0)
        # Maintain decreasing order of dp values
        while dq and dp[dq[-1]] <= dp[i]:
            dq.pop()
        # Only add to deque if dp[i] is positive (optional optimization)
        if dp[i] > 0:
            dq.append(i)
    return max(dp)
```

```javascript
function constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k) {
  const dq = [];
  const dp = new Array(nums.length);
  let maxSum = -Infinity;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (dq.length && dq[0] < i - k) dq.shift();
    dp[i] = nums[i] + (dq.length ? dp[dq[0]] : 0);
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
    while (dq.length && dp[dq[dq.length - 1]] <= dp[i]) dq.pop();
    if (dp[i] > 0) dq.push(i);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int constrainedSubsetSum(int[] nums, int k) {
    Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekFirst() < i - k) dq.pollFirst();
        dp[i] = nums[i] + (!dq.isEmpty() ? dp[dq.peekFirst()] : 0);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
        while (!dq.isEmpty() && dp[dq.peekLast()] <= dp[i]) dq.pollLast();
        if (dp[i] > 0) dq.offerLast(i);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our dataset of 17 questions shows a clear skew: **0% Easy, 35% Medium (6 questions), 65% Hard (11 questions)**. This distribution is telling.

Monotonic queue problems are rarely introductory. They typically appear as optimized solutions to problems that can initially be approached with slower algorithms (like brute-force sliding window or naive DP). Interviewers use them to separate candidates who know pattern recognition from those who don't. The high percentage of Hard problems indicates this topic is often reserved for senior-level interviews or as a follow-up optimization challenge after discussing simpler solutions.

## Which Companies Ask Monotonic Queue

This pattern is a favorite at companies that emphasize algorithmic rigor and large-scale data processing. The top askers are:

- [Google](/company/google) – Frequently asks sliding window maximum and DP optimization problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – Common in online assessment rounds for array/window challenges.
- [Meta](/company/meta) – Appears in problems related to feed ranking or time-series data.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) – Known for next-greater-element and constrained subsequence problems.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – Uses them in financial data stream analysis (e.g., stock price windows).

## Study Tips

1.  **Start with the Deque Abstraction:** Understand how a double-ended queue works in your language of choice (`collections.deque` in Python, `ArrayDeque` in Java, array simulation in JavaScript). The core operations are `popleft`/`pop` (Python), `pollFirst`/`pollLast` (Java), and `shift`/`pop` (JavaScript).
2.  **Practice the Two-Step Maintenance:** For every new element, always: 1) remove out-of-window indices from the front, and 2) maintain monotonicity by popping from the back. This invariant is universal.
3.  **Map Problems to Known Patterns:** If a problem asks for extreme values (max/min) in a subarray or window, or optimizes a DP transition with a range constraint, immediately consider a monotonic queue.
4.  **Implement from Scratch:** Don't rely on libraries. Practice writing the deque logic manually to build muscle memory for the index management and comparison logic.

Mastering monotonic queues requires recognizing the pattern and executing the maintenance steps flawlessly. The investment pays off disproportionately in tackling high-difficulty array and dynamic programming questions.
