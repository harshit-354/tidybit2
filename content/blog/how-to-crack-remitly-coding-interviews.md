Landing a software engineering role at Remitly means proving you can build reliable, scalable systems for a global financial platform. Their coding interviews are designed to assess your fundamental problem-solving skills and your ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical screening rounds, often conducted via platforms like CodeSignal or HackerRank, followed by a virtual onsite with multiple coding and system design sessions. Understanding the specific patterns they favor is your key to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Remitly coding questions reveals a clear, candidate-friendly pattern: **0% Hard, 60% Medium, and 40% Easy**. This distribution is critical for your preparation strategy.

It means Remitly prioritizes **foundational mastery and execution speed** over solving obscure, complex puzzles. You won't be expected to reinvent an advanced graph algorithm on the fly. Instead, you must demonstrate flawless command of core data structures and the ability to apply standard patterns to slightly novel problems. The 60% Medium weighting is the core of the interview—these questions test if you can recognize a problem type (e.g., "this is a sliding window variation") and implement a bug-free, optimized solution within 25-30 minutes. The 40% Easy questions serve as a baseline filter; failing here is not an option. Your goal is to ace every Easy, solve most Mediums optimally, and have enough time to discuss edge cases and complexity.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward these five areas, which constitute the vast majority of Remitly's questions.

- **Array:** The most frequent data structure. Master in-place operations, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for frequency counting, memoization, and matching pairs.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array and Hash Table problems. Focus on manipulation, palindrome checks, and substring searches.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for Medium problems. Start with classic 1D and 2D problems like climbing stairs or coin change to internalize the pattern.
- **Depth-First Search:** Applied to tree and graph traversal. Understand recursive and iterative implementations for problems involving paths, connectivity, or state exploration.

For Remitly, **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a particularly high-value topic for tackling their Medium-difficulty questions. The core pattern involves breaking a problem into overlapping subproblems, storing their results, and building a solution bottom-up. Here is the classic "Climbing Stairs" problem implemented in three languages, demonstrating the space-optimized DP approach.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """Returns distinct ways to climb n stairs (1 or 2 steps at a time)."""
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    # dp[i] = ways to reach step i
    prev, curr = 1, 2  # dp[1], dp[2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr  # dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return curr
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let prev = 1,
    curr = 2; // ways for step 1 and 2
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
  }
  return curr;
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int prev = 1, curr = 2; // dp[1], dp[2]
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    return curr;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is non-negotiable. Here is a focused 5-week schedule.

- **Week 1-2: Core Foundations.** Dedicate this phase to Easy problems on **Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings**. Solve 30-40 problems. Your objective is speed and 100% accuracy. Use a timer.
- **Week 3: Conquering Mediums.** Transition to Medium problems. Focus on the remaining top topics: **Dynamic Programming and Depth-First Search**. Solve 15-20 DP problems, starting with the classic patterns. Solve 10-15 tree/graph DFS problems.
- **Week 4: Integration and Patterns.** Practice Medium problems that mix topics (e.g., "Hash Table + Array" or "DFS + DP"). Focus on pattern recognition. Start doing 2-3 timed mock interviews per week, simulating a 45-minute session with a Medium question.
- **Week 5: Refinement and Review.** Re-solve your previously missed problems. Systematically review time/space complexity analysis for all your solutions. Practice explaining your code out loud as you write it.
- **Final Days:** Light practice only. Review key patterns and get adequate rest.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a single line of code, restate the problem, confirm edge cases, and outline your approach. Verbalize your thought process as you code. This turns a silent test into a collaborative session.
2.  **Optimize Iteratively.** First, state the brute-force solution and its complexity. Then, logically propose your optimization (e.g., "We can use a hash map here to reduce lookups from O(n) to O(1)"). This demonstrates structured problem-solving.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include a comment for complex logic, and handle obvious edge cases (null input, empty array, single element). Write clean code as if a colleague will maintain it.
4.  **Test with Examples.** After coding, don't just announce you're done. Walk through a small test case with your code, including a potential edge case. This often helps you catch off-by-one errors before the interviewer does.

Success in Remitly's interviews hinges on consistent, deliberate practice of their favored patterns. Build the muscle memory for Arrays, Hash Tables, and DP, and you'll walk into your interview with confidence.
