Cohesity’s technical interview process is known for its depth and focus on practical problem-solving. Candidates typically face a series of coding rounds that test algorithmic proficiency, system design fundamentals, and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The problems are designed to assess not just whether you can find a solution, but how you optimize it and handle edge cases.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Cohesity’s coding questions skew heavily toward advanced challenges. The breakdown is: **Easy: 0%**, **Medium: 33%**, **Hard: 67%**. This distribution is a clear signal. Cohesity is selecting for engineers who can tackle complex, open-ended problems. A single medium-difficulty question might serve as a warm-up, but the core of the interview will be solving one or two substantial hard problems within the allotted time. This means your preparation must go beyond memorizing solutions. You need deep mastery of core data structures and algorithms, exceptional skills in optimization, and the stamina to work through multi-layered problems.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequently tested areas are **Sorting, Array, Binary Search, Two Pointers, and Design**. These topics often intertwine in Cohesity’s problems.

- **Sorting & Array:** The foundation. Many hard problems begin with an unsorted array, and applying a sort (often O(n log n)) is the first step to enabling more efficient algorithms like two pointers or binary search. Master in-place sorts like quicksort and mergesort.
- **Binary Search:** A critical optimization tool. At Cohesity, binary search is rarely about simply finding an element in a sorted array. It’s frequently applied in "search in a sorted 2D matrix" problems or, more advanced, in problems where you binary search on a _range of answers_ (e.g., "find the minimum capacity to ship packages in D days").
- **Two Pointers:** An essential technique for achieving O(n) time on sorted arrays or sequences. It's crucial for problems involving pairs, subarrays, or removing duplicates in-place.
- **Design:** While separate from pure coding, expect discussions on designing scalable systems or data structures (like a LRU Cache). This tests your architectural thinking and practical knowledge.

The most important combined pattern is **Sorting + Two Pointers**. This is a classic setup for solving problems like finding all unique triplets that sum to zero. Here is a clear implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def three_sum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue  # Skip duplicate for i
        left, right = i + 1, n - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total < 0:
                left += 1
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1
            else:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                # Skip duplicates for left pointer
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                    left += 1
    return result
```

```javascript
function threeSum(nums) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const result = [];
  const n = nums.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicate for i
    let left = i + 1;
    let right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      const total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
      if (total < 0) {
        left++;
      } else if (total > 0) {
        right--;
      } else {
        result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
        left++;
        right--;
        // Skip duplicates for left pointer
        while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left - 1]) {
          left++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicate for i
            int left = i + 1, right = n - 1;
            while (left < right) {
                int total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                if (total < 0) {
                    left++;
                } else if (total > 0) {
                    right--;
                } else {
                    result.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]));
                    left++;
                    right--;
                    // Skip duplicates for left pointer
                    while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left - 1]) {
                        left++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the high difficulty, a structured, intensive plan is necessary.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top topics. Solve 5-7 problems per topic, starting with medium difficulty and progressing to hard. For each problem, implement the brute force solution first, then optimize. Write code for every solution in your primary language.
**Weeks 3-4: Hard Problem Immersion.** Focus exclusively on hard problems from LeetCode, particularly those tagged with Cohesity's top topics. Aim for 2-3 problems per day. Spend at least 45 minutes struggling with a problem before looking at hints. Practice verbalizing your thought process out loud as if an interviewer is present.
**Week 5: Mock Interviews & Design.** Conduct at least 4-5 timed mock interviews (90 minutes each) with a peer or using a platform. Include one hard problem and one system design question (e.g., design a rate limiter, a key-value store) in each session. Simulate the pressure.
**Week 6: Review & Polish.** Revisit all problems you struggled with. Systematically review patterns, not solutions. Ensure you can derive the optimal approach from first principles. Practice writing flawless, compilable code on a whiteboard or plain text editor without autocomplete.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize Relentlessly.** For any solution you propose, immediately discuss its time and space complexity. Be prepared to be asked, "Can we do better?" Always think about sorting first to unlock O(n log n) or O(n) solutions.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code.** For hard problems, spend the first 5-10 minutes discussing examples, edge cases, and potential approaches with your interviewer. This collaborative thinking is valued more than silent, rushed coding.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases Explicitly.** Always check for empty input, single elements, large values, and duplicates. Verbally state these as you write your code. This demonstrates production-level coding discipline.
4.  **Practice Writing Code on a Whiteboard.** The physical act is different from typing. Practice writing syntactically correct code by hand to build muscle memory and avoid simple syntax errors during the interview.

Success in a Cohesity interview is a function of depth over breadth. Master the core patterns that their problems are built upon, and practice applying them under time constraints.
