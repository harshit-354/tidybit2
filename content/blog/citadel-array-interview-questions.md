Array questions dominate Citadel’s technical interviews, making up exactly half of their problem set. For a firm that trades at microsecond speeds and builds high-performance systems, this focus is intentional. Arrays represent the most fundamental, contiguous data structure—the backbone of efficient data access, caching, and numerical computation. Mastery here signals you can think in terms of memory, iteration, and optimal algorithms, which is critical for the low-latency, data-intensive work at a quantitative hedge fund. If you can’t solve array problems quickly and correctly, you likely won’t progress.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Citadel’s array problems are rarely simple traversals. Expect heavy emphasis on **optimization, subarray manipulations, and combining arrays with other paradigms**. Common patterns include:

- **Sliding Window & Two Pointers:** For problems involving contiguous subarrays meeting a sum or length condition (e.g., maximum/minimum subarray, string permutations).
- **Prefix Sum & Hashing:** Used to find subarrays summing to a target or to optimize range queries. This is common in problems that ask for the number of subarrays with a specific property.
- **In-place Array Modification:** Tasks like removing duplicates, rotating the array, or applying the Dutch National Flag algorithm without extra space. Tests your understanding of index manipulation.
- **Simulation & Matrix Traversal:** Spiral order, rotation, or search in a 2D matrix (which is essentially an array of arrays). These test precise control and off-by-one error avoidance.
- **Combination with Data Structures:** Often, the optimal solution requires augmenting array traversal with a hash map (for lookups) or a heap (for tracking extremes).

The problems are designed to have a brute-force solution that is obvious and an optimal solution that requires insight. You will be pushed to derive and code the optimal approach.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on **pattern recognition, not memorization**. For each problem type, learn the core technique and its time/space complexity trade-offs. Practice explaining your reasoning aloud as you code. A key strategy is to first identify the problem category—this narrows your solution search dramatically.

A fundamental pattern is the **Sliding Window** for finding the longest subarray with a constraint. Here is a template for the problem: _"Find the length of the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k."_

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_subarray_sum_at_most_k(nums, k):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        # Shrink window from left while sum exceeds k
        while current_sum > k and left <= right:
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        # Update max length for valid window
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

```javascript
function longestSubarraySumAtMostK(nums, k) {
  let left = 0;
  let currentSum = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    currentSum += nums[right];
    // Shrink window from left while sum exceeds k
    while (currentSum > k && left <= right) {
      currentSum -= nums[left];
      left++;
    }
    // Update max length for valid window
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLength;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubarraySumAtMostK(int[] nums, int k) {
    int left = 0;
    int currentSum = 0;
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        currentSum += nums[right];
        // Shrink window from left while sum exceeds k
        while (currentSum > k && left <= right) {
            currentSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        // Update max length for valid window
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Foundation:** Start with basic in-place operations (remove duplicates, rotate array) and two-pointer techniques.
2.  **Core Patterns:** Deep dive into Sliding Window (fixed and variable size) and Prefix Sum problems. These are Citadel staples.
3.  **Combination Problems:** Practice problems that require a hash map alongside traversal (e.g., subarray sum equals k) or a heap (sliding window median).
4.  **2D Arrays:** Move on to matrix traversal, rotation, and search problems.
5.  **Citadel-Specific:** Finally, work through all 48 array problems tagged for Citadel on platforms like TidyBit to acclimate to their style and difficulty.
