When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and Nutanix represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum—one a global IT services giant and the other a focused enterprise cloud software company. Their question banks on TidyBit reveal clear differences in volume, difficulty, and focus, which directly shape how you should prepare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. TCS's list of **217 questions** is over three times larger than Nutanix's **68 questions**. This volume suggests TCS interviews may draw from a broader, more generalized pool of problems, requiring candidates to cover more ground.

The difficulty distribution also highlights different priorities:

- **TCS (E94/M103/H20):** The emphasis is overwhelmingly on **Easy** and **Medium** questions. With only 20 Hard questions, the interview likely tests strong foundational knowledge and problem-solving fluency under standard conditions, rather than extreme algorithmic optimization.
- **Nutanix (E5/M46/H17):** The focus shifts sharply to **Medium** and **Hard** problems. With just 5 Easy questions, Nutanix interviews are designed to assess deeper algorithmic thinking and the ability to handle complex scenarios, which is typical for core software engineering roles at product companies.

This contrast means preparation intensity differs: TCS requires broader coverage of fundamentals, while Nutanix demands deeper, more rigorous practice on challenging problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, but with a key divergence in advanced topics.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems form a common foundation. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures. For example, a classic two-pointer technique with arrays is essential for both.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
// Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (!nums.length) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
// Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

</div>

**Diverging Specialties:**

- **TCS** prominently lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic, reinforcing the importance of efficient in-place array and string algorithms.
- **Nutanix** lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a graph and tree traversal algorithm. This signals that Nutanix interviews frequently involve recursive problem-solving, tree manipulation, or graph exploration—topics common in systems and software design.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# DFS: Preorder tree traversal
def dfs_preorder(node):
    if not node:
        return
    print(node.val)
    dfs_preorder(node.left)
    dfs_preorder(node.right)
```

```javascript
// DFS: Preorder tree traversal
function dfsPreorder(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  console.log(node.val);
  dfsPreorder(node.left);
  dfsPreorder(node.right);
}
```

```java
// DFS: Preorder tree traversal
public void dfsPreorder(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    System.out.println(node.val);
    dfsPreorder(node.left);
    dfsPreorder(node.right);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target role and interview timeline.

**Prepare for TCS first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting IT services/consultancy roles. The larger volume of predominantly Easy and Medium questions provides an excellent structured path to solidify your fundamentals across arrays, strings, and hash tables. Mastering this list will build the speed and confidence needed for many generalist coding interviews.

**Prepare for Nutanix first if:** You are aiming for software engineering roles at product-based or tech-focused companies and already have a solid grasp of basics. The concentrated set of Medium and Hard problems, including graph/tree algorithms like DFS, will push you to develop the advanced problem-solving and optimization skills these roles demand. This deep practice will also make revisiting broader question sets like TCS's more manageable.

In summary, use TCS's list for broad foundational drill and Nutanix's list for targeted, deep-dive algorithmic practice. Align your primary focus with the company profile that matches your career goals.
