When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and demands of each can dramatically improve your efficiency. Visa and Airbnb, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you prioritize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a significant difference in the scale of their known question pools and how those questions are rated.

**Visa** has a larger, more extensive question bank with approximately **124 questions**. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted toward medium problems: 32 Easy (E32), 72 Medium (M72), and 20 Hard (H20). This suggests Visa's interview process is built on a broad foundation of medium-difficulty problems, testing consistent, reliable application of core concepts. The high volume indicates you should prepare for a wide variety of scenarios within their focused topic areas.

**Airbnb** has a more curated question pool of about **64 questions**. The distribution is 11 Easy (E11), 34 Medium (M34), and 19 Hard (H19). Notably, nearly 30% of their questions are rated as Hard, a much higher proportion than Visa's ~16%. This points to an interview style that may dive deeper into complex problem-solving and optimization, even with a smaller overall set of concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize fundamental data structures, but with a key divergence in advanced topics.

The **core overlap** is substantial: **Array, String, and Hash Table** are top topics for both. You can expect problems involving string manipulation, array traversal, and efficient lookups at both companies.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common overlapping problem - Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common overlapping problem - Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common overlapping problem - Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The **critical difference** is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. DP is a top-4 topic for Airbnb but is not listed among Visa's top focuses (which includes Sorting). This means for Airbnb, you must be prepared for complex optimization problems involving recursion, memoization, or tabulation. Visa's inclusion of Sorting suggests a stronger emphasis on algorithms that efficiently organize data.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A potential Airbnb DP problem - House Robber
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, len(nums) + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])
    return dp[-1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A potential Airbnb DP problem - House Robber
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = nums[0];
  for (let i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1]);
  }
  return dp[nums.length];
}
```

```java
// Example: A potential Airbnb DP problem - House Robber
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length + 1];
    dp[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[nums.length];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and the breadth of your study timeline.

If you are **early in your interview prep or targeting both companies**, start with **Visa**. Its vast pool of primarily medium-difficulty questions on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables provides an excellent and broad foundation. Mastering these will solidify the core skills needed for most technical interviews, including Airbnb's overlapping topics. Visa's focus is a perfect training ground for building speed and accuracy.

If **Airbnb is your primary target**, you must layer on **intensive Dynamic Programming practice** after securing the fundamentals. The high percentage of Hard questions indicates you should practice breaking down complex problems and writing optimized, bug-free code under pressure. Prioritize common DP patterns (knapsack, sequence, partition) and graph problems, which often accompany DP in harder questions.

In summary, use Visa's profile to build a wide, solid base of competency. Use Airbnb's profile to deepen that knowledge with advanced optimization techniques and complex problem-solving.
