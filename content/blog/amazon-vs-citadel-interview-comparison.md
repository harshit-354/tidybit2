When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each firm is crucial for efficient preparation. Amazon and Citadel, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and emphasis. Amazon's process is a high-volume test of breadth and foundational mastery, whereas Citadel's is a concentrated assessment of depth and performance under pressure.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark difference in scale. Amazon has a massive, well-documented repository of **1,938 questions**, categorized by difficulty as Easy (530), Medium (1,057), and Hard (351). This volume reflects Amazon's standardized, process-driven hiring for a vast number of roles. The interview is designed to consistently evaluate core competencies across many candidates. You can expect a mix of problems, with a strong emphasis on Medium-level questions that test the application of fundamental data structures and algorithms to practical scenarios.

In contrast, Citadel's question pool is sharply focused at **96 questions**, with a distribution of Easy (6), Medium (59), and Hard (31). This smaller, more intense set indicates a highly selective process targeting specialized roles, particularly in quantitative research and trading. The significantly higher proportion of Medium and Hard problems means you are far more likely to encounter complex, optimized solutions. Citadel questions often have a "trick" or require deep insight, testing not just correctness but the elegance and efficiency of your approach under time constraints.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily prioritize the same core data structures: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is the key to strategic preparation. Mastering these topics will build a strong foundation for both interview processes.

- **Arrays & Strings:** Expect manipulations, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and sorting-related logic at both companies.
- **Hash Tables:** Essential for achieving O(1) lookups and solving frequency-counting problems, which are ubiquitous.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical differentiator. While both test DP, Citadel's problems in this domain are frequently more mathematically nuanced or require non-standard state definitions.

The primary difference lies in context and depth. Amazon's questions on these topics often map directly to real-world system design or data processing tasks (e.g., merging logs, implementing features). Citadel's questions may embed these structures within problems related to statistics, game theory, or financial modeling, requiring a layer of mathematical translation before the coding begins.

```python
# Example: A Two-Pointer problem (common at both)
def max_area(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_water = 0
    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        max_water = max(max_water, width * current_height)
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return max_water
```

```javascript
// Example: A Two-Pointer problem (common at both)
function maxArea(height) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let maxWater = 0;
  while (left < right) {
    const width = right - left;
    const currentHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    maxWater = Math.max(maxWater, width * currentHeight);
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return maxWater;
}
```

```java
// Example: A Two-Pointer problem (common at both)
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = height.length - 1;
    int maxWater = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        int width = right - left;
        int currentHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        maxWater = Math.max(maxWater, width * currentHeight);
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return maxWater;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Amazon**. Its enormous question bank is essentially a comprehensive curriculum for core algorithmic interviewing. Working through a broad set of Amazon's Medium-difficulty problems will solidify your skills in the key overlapping topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP). This builds the versatile foundation needed for any technical interview.

Once this foundation is strong, pivot to **Citadel** preparation. Treat Citadel's question list as a set of advanced, focused drills. The smaller pool is manageable for deep study. Practice solving these problems with extreme attention to optimization, edge cases, and clarity of thought. The intensity of Citadel's format requires you to perform at a high level consistently; there is little room for error or slow starts.

In summary, use Amazon's breadth to learn the rules of the game, and then use Citadel's depth to master them under championship conditions.
