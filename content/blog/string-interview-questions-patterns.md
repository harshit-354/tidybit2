# String Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

String manipulation is a cornerstone of coding interviews. It appears in over 10% of technical questions across major platforms because strings are fundamental, memory-efficient, and perfect for testing logic, edge-case handling, and familiarity with language-specific APIs. With 676 cataloged questions, mastering strings is non-negotiable.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing these patterns turns complex problems into methodical solutions.

**Two Pointers**
Use two indices to traverse a string from opposite ends or at different speeds. Ideal for palindrome checks, reversing, or in-place modifications.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

</div>

**Sliding Window**
Maintain a dynamic window to track substrings meeting specific criteria, often with a hash map for character counts. Essential for longest substring or anagram problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charSet = new Set();
  let left = 0,
    maxLen = 0;
  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (charSet.has(s[right])) {
      charSet.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    charSet.add(s[right]);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

**Character Counting with Hash Maps**
Map characters to frequencies to compare strings or validate anagrams efficiently.

**String Building**
Avoid repeated string concatenation (O(n²) in some languages). Use language-specific builders: `list` in Python, array in JavaScript, `StringBuilder` in Java.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The distribution—Easy: 201 (30%), Medium: 328 (49%), Hard: 147 (22%)—reveals the interview landscape. Easy questions test basic manipulation and API knowledge. Medium problems, the core of interviews, combine patterns like sliding window with hash maps. Hard questions often involve dynamic programming, advanced pointer manipulation, or multiple pattern integration. Focus on Mediums to build competency, then tackle Hards for top-tier company prep.

## Which Companies Ask String Questions

All major tech firms emphasize string problems:

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks complex string parsing and DP.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) favors practical problems like string transformation.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) tests edge cases in basic operations.
- [Meta](/company/meta) focuses on efficient substring and pattern matching.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) uses strings for financial data processing.

## Study Tips

1. **Internalize Language APIs** – Know how to split, join, slice, and search strings in your language. Time saved here is critical.
2. **Practice Pattern Mapping** – When you see a problem, immediately categorize it. Is it a two-pointer comparison? A sliding window search?
3. **Start with Brute Force** – Before optimizing, write a working solution. It clarifies the problem and ensures you have a fallback.
4. **Test with Edge Cases** – Empty strings, single characters, Unicode, and very long inputs break naive solutions. Always test them.

Master these patterns, understand the difficulty curve, and target company-specific tendencies to turn string problems from obstacles into opportunities.
