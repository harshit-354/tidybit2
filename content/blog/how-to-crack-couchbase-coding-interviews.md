Couchbase interviews test your ability to design scalable systems and manipulate data efficiently, reflecting their focus on distributed NoSQL databases and real-time applications. The coding portion is typically a mix of algorithmic problem-solving and system design, with a strong emphasis on practical, performant solutions. Understanding their data patterns is your first strategic advantage.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: 100% of Couchbase's coding questions are either Easy (50%) or Medium (50%), with no Hard problems. This breakdown is significant. It doesn't mean the interview is easy; it means the evaluation criteria shifts. Mastery of fundamentals is non-negotiable. You won't be expected to solve obscure, complex graph algorithms under extreme time pressure. Instead, you will be judged on writing clean, correct, and efficient code for common data structure problems. The absence of Hard questions suggests they prioritize reliable execution and clear communication over algorithmic wizardry. Your goal is to solve the Medium problems flawlessly and breeze through the Easy ones, leaving ample time for discussion and optimization.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form the core of your preparation. These are not random; they map directly to database operations like indexing (Hash Table), sequential data access (Array, Linked List), and system architecture (Design).

- **Array & Two Pointers:** Often tested together. You must be proficient in in-place manipulations, sliding windows, and searching within sorted arrays. The two-pointer technique is a fundamental optimization for array problems.
- **Hash Table:** The single most important data structure for Couchbase. It's the engine behind database indexing (like primary and secondary indexes in Couchbase itself). Expect problems involving frequency counting, lookups, and deduplication.
- **Linked List:** Tests your understanding of pointers/references and edge-case handling (null head, single node). Problems often involve reversal, cycle detection, or merging.
- **Design:** This is where Couchbase's identity shines. Be prepared for object-oriented design (e.g., design a key-value store) or basic system design concepts that relate to caching, consistency, or data modeling.

For the most important pattern—**Hash Table for frequency counting**—here is a classic problem: _Given an array of integers, return the first character that appears more than once._

<div class="code-group">

```python
def first_recurring_character(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None  # or raise an exception

# Example usage
print(first_recurring_character([2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 2
```

```javascript
function firstRecurringCharacter(nums) {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (seen.has(num)) {
      return num;
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return null;
}

// Example usage
console.log(firstRecurringCharacter([2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4])); // Output: 2
```

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public static Integer firstRecurringCharacter(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (seen.contains(num)) {
                return num;
            }
            seen.add(num);
        }
        return null;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] input = {2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4};
        System.out.println(firstRecurringCharacter(input)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused plan is critical. Don't just solve random problems.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate one week to **Array and Two Pointers**. Master sorting, binary search, and the sliding window pattern. Dedicate the next week to **Hash Table and Linked List**. Implement a hash table from scratch to understand collisions. Solve every major variation of linked list reversal and cycle detection.
- **Week 3: Design & Integration.** Shift focus to **Design**. Practice object-oriented design problems, especially those involving data structures (e.g., design an LRU cache, which combines hash table and linked list). Start integrating topics by solving Medium problems that combine them, like "Merge Intervals" (array, sorting) or "LRU Cache" (design, hash table, linked list).
- **Week 4: Mock Interviews & Couchbase Context.** Conduct at least 4-5 timed mock interviews using Couchbase's tagged questions or similar Easy/Medium problems. In every solution, articulate _why_ a hash table is efficient (O(1) lookups) or how your array solution scales. Think aloud about trade-offs.
- **Final Days (Ongoing):** Re-solve your initial mistakes. Write code by hand on paper or a whiteboard to simulate the interview environment. Review database fundamentals like indexing (a hash table) and caching strategies.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Readability First, Then Performance.** Write straightforward code with clear variable names. A correct, readable Easy/Medium solution is better than a buggy, "clever" one. Once it works, then discuss optimizations (e.g., "We could use a hash map here to reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1)").
2.  **Connect Solutions to Databases.** When you use a hash table, mention it's analogous to a primary key lookup. When discussing design, consider concepts like eventual consistency or in-memory caching. This shows you're thinking like an engineer who understands their domain.
3.  **Practice Verbalizing Trade-offs.** For every problem, be prepared to answer: "What is the time and space complexity?" and "What if the input data was too large to fit in memory?" This demonstrates systems thinking.
4.  **Handle Edge Cases Proactively.** Before you start coding, state your assumptions and list edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Systematically handling these is a hallmark of production-ready code.

Your preparation should make the common patterns—checking for existence with a hash table, traversing a list with two pointers—feel automatic. This frees your mental energy to tackle the system design aspects where Couchbase truly differentiates its interviews.
