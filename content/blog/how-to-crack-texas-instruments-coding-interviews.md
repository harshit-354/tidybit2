Texas Instruments (TI) coding interviews assess strong fundamentals in algorithms and data structures, with a particular emphasis on efficient problem-solving for embedded systems and low-level optimization. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on coding challenges, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or via a shared document. The problems are designed to test not just correctness but also your ability to reason about performance and edge cases in constrained environments.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, the question difficulty distribution is revealing: 0% Easy, 50% Medium, and 50% Hard. This breakdown signals that TI does not use introductory questions to warm up candidates. You are expected to be interview-ready from the first minute. The high proportion of Hard problems indicates they are looking for engineers who can tackle complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, likely simulating difficult optimization or system-level logic problems. The complete absence of Easy questions means your preparation must skip the basics and dive straight into substantial, pattern-based problem-solving.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Dynamic Programming, String, Array, Backtracking, and Two Pointers. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** The most critical topic. TI heavily tests DP, likely for optimization problems common in resource-constrained hardware. You must be fluent in both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
- **String Manipulation:** Problems often involve parsing, matching, or transforming string data, which is fundamental for software interfacing with hardware protocols.
- **Array Algorithms:** Core to data processing. Expect questions on searching, sorting, and subarray problems that require efficient, in-place operations.
- **Backtracking:** Used for generating permutations, solving puzzles, or exploring all possible configurations—a pattern relevant to system state exploration.
- **Two Pointers:** An essential technique for optimizing solutions involving arrays or strings, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

Given DP's prominence, the most important pattern to internalize is the **0/1 Knapsack DP framework**. It's the foundation for many resource allocation and optimization problems.

```python
def knapsack_01(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    # dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take the item
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip the item
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w] # Cannot take this item
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack_01(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack01(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example usage
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack01(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack01(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                    int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack01(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the difficulty curve, a rigorous, focused plan is required.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Topic Deep Dive**

- Days 1-3: Master Arrays and Two Pointers. Solve 10-15 problems covering sliding window, prefix sums, and in-place operations.
- Days 4-7: Tackle String algorithms, focusing on palindrome checks, anagrams, and substring problems.
- Days 8-14: Dedicate a full week to Dynamic Programming. Start with Fibonacci and climb stairs, move to 0/1 Knapsack, unbounded knapsack, and longest common subsequence. Solve at least 20 DP problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Topics and Pattern Integration**

- Days 15-21: Study Backtracking. Practice generating all subsets, permutations, and solving N-Queens or Sudoku-style problems.
- Days 22-28: Begin mixed-topic practice. Use platforms to solve Medium and Hard problems without knowing the category in advance. Focus on identifying which pattern (DP, Two Pointers, Backtracking) fits the problem.

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation and Refinement**

- Conduct timed mock interviews (60-90 minutes) with a focus on 2 problems: one Medium and one Hard. Practice verbalizing your thought process clearly.
- Revisit all incorrect problems. Analyze why you missed the optimal pattern and re-solve them without reference.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second:** Given TI's context, always discuss time and space complexity upfront. For Hard problems, a brute-force explanation followed by an optimized solution shows structured thinking.
2.  **Practice on Paper or a Plain Text Editor:** Interviews may not have an IDE. Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code without auto-complete or immediate feedback.
3.  **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases Explicitly:** Before coding, ask about input size, value ranges, and valid outputs. This is crucial for choosing the right algorithm (e.g., DP vs. greedy) and shows a detail-oriented mindset.
4.  **Connect Solutions to Real-World Use:** When possible, briefly mention how a pattern (like state DP) could relate to managing system states or resource scheduling in embedded systems. This demonstrates applied knowledge.

Success in a Texas Instruments interview requires moving beyond simply solving problems to demonstrating deep, intuitive mastery of core algorithmic patterns under pressure. Focus your energy on the high-difficulty, high-frequency topics, and practice until the patterns become automatic.
