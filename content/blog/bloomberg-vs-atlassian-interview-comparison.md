When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Bloomberg and Atlassian, while both prestigious, present distinct interview landscapes. Bloomberg's process is known for its breadth and intensity, heavily focused on financial data and real-time systems, whereas Atlassian's interviews often emphasize software design, system architecture, and clean code within a product development context. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of preparation differs vastly between these two companies.

**Bloomberg** maintains a massive, publicly tracked repository of **1,173 questions**. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium and hard problems: 391 Easy (E), 625 Medium (M), and 157 Hard (H). This volume indicates a wide-ranging interview scope where you can expect a mix of classic algorithmic challenges and problems with a financial or data-processing twist. Preparing for Bloomberg requires endurance and the ability to solve a high number of medium-difficulty problems under time pressure.

**Atlassian** has a significantly smaller, more curated set of **62 questions**. The distribution is 7 Easy, 43 Medium, and 12 Hard. This suggests their interview process, while still rigorous, may drill deeper into a smaller set of concepts or place greater emphasis on system design and behavioral rounds. The high concentration of medium problems means you must master fundamental algorithms thoroughly, as you're likely to encounter nuanced variations.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize core computer science fundamentals, but with different secondary emphases.

The top topics for **Bloomberg** are Array, String, Hash Table, and Math. Bloomberg interviews frequently involve manipulating and processing large datasets (arrays, strings) efficiently, often requiring hash tables for optimal lookups. Math problems can relate to statistical calculations or financial modeling.

The top topics for **Atlassian** are Array, Hash Table, String, and Sorting. The overlap with Bloomberg on the first three is significant. However, Atlassian's inclusion of **Sorting** as a top topic is notable. This may point to a focus on data organization, merging streams, or preparing data for specific operations, which aligns with backend product development.

Here is a common pattern—using a hash table to solve a two-sum problem—that is highly relevant for both companies:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your timeline and the breadth of your job search.

**Prepare for Atlassian first if** you are early in your interview cycle or want to solidify your core algorithmic skills. The smaller, medium-focused question set provides a manageable yet comprehensive foundation in arrays, hash tables, and sorting. Mastering these 62 questions will build strong fundamentals applicable to almost any technical interview, including Bloomberg's.

**Prepare for Bloomberg first if** you have an interview scheduled soon or are specifically targeting finance-tech roles. The enormous question bank demands dedicated, long-term practice. Starting with Bloomberg's problems will force you to grind through a high volume of medium-difficulty questions, which is excellent general preparation but can be overwhelming. A practical hybrid approach is to use Bloomberg's list for high-volume practice on core topics, while studying Atlassian's list for focused review on key patterns.

Ultimately, the core topics overlap significantly. A strong strategy is to achieve fluency in array, string, and hash table manipulations, then branch out to company-specific nuances: math and data intensity for Bloomberg, and sorting and system design for Atlassian.
