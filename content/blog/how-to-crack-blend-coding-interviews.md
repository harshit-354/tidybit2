Blend’s technical interviews are designed to assess your ability to solve practical, medium-difficulty problems under pressure. The process typically involves one or two live coding rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often with a strong emphasis on data manipulation and optimization. Success hinges on a targeted understanding of their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data is clear: 100% of Blend’s coding questions are categorized as **Medium** difficulty. This is a critical strategic insight. It means you won’t encounter trivial warm-up problems, nor will you typically face the abstract, brain-bending puzzles of "Hard" level questions. The interview is a test of consistent, reliable skill.

What does a "Medium" problem at Blend entail? You can expect scenarios that require combining 2-3 core concepts. A question might involve iterating through an array (a simple concept) but require using a hash table for efficient lookups and applying a specific algorithm like binary search or sliding window to meet optimal time complexity. The challenge is not in knowing a single trick, but in cleanly integrating fundamental tools to solve a non-obvious problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time should be heavily weighted toward these five areas, which form the backbone of Blend’s question bank.

- **Array:** Master in-place manipulations, subarray problems, and the two-pointer technique. It's the most common data structure you'll work with.
- **Hash Table:** Your go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups and storing mappings. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, or deduplication.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems. Focus on character encoding, palindromes, and anagram checks using arrays or hash tables as counters.
- **Binary Search:** Don't just memorize the template for sorted arrays. Understand how to apply it to answer "minimum/maximum possible value" questions on a solution space (e.g., capacity planning, split array largest sum).
- **Dynamic Programming:** The most complex of the common topics. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems in sequences (strings, arrays) and 2D grids. Start with classic patterns like "Longest Increasing Subsequence" or "0/1 Knapsack."

The most frequent pattern is combining an **Array** with a **Hash Table** to track state or indices. A prime example is the "Subarray Sum Equals K" problem, which perfectly demonstrates this blend of concepts.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarraySum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    # Hash map: prefix_sum -> frequency of that sum
    sum_map = {0: 1}

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # If (prefix_sum - k) exists, we found a subarray summing to k
        count += sum_map.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Update the frequency of the current prefix sum
        sum_map[prefix_sum] = sum_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumMap = new Map();
  sumMap.set(0, 1);

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    if (sumMap.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumMap.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    sumMap.set(prefixSum, (sumMap.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>();
    sumMap.put(0, 1);

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        count += sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        sumMap.put(prefixSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition**

- Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. Solve 5-8 medium problems per topic.
- Don't just solve; categorize. For each problem, identify the core pattern (e.g., "This is a sliding window problem on a string with a hash map counter").
- Implement solutions in your primary language, then re-implement a few in a secondary language to reinforce syntax.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Company-Specific Practice**

- Shift to solving random medium problems that combine topics (e.g., arrays + hash table + binary search).
- Start timing yourself. Aim for 20-25 minutes to understand, solve, and test a problem.
- Spend at least 50% of this period working on actual **Blend-tagged problems** on platforms like TidyBit. This acclimates you to their problem style and difficulty curve.

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Refinement**

- Conduct at least 3-5 full mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Use a timer, video call, and a shared editor to mimic the real environment.
- Focus on communication. Verbally explain your thought process before writing code.
- Review your weakest patterns. If Dynamic Programming is shaky, spend a final deep-dive on 2-3 key problem types.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process, Not Just Your Solution.** From the moment you see the problem, talk out loud. Clarify constraints, state your initial brute-force idea, then explain the optimization. This turns the interview into a collaboration and showcases your problem-solving logic.
2.  **Optimize for Medium.** Since all questions are medium, your default approach should be to find the O(n log n) or O(n) solution. Always mention the brute-force O(n²) or O(2^n) solution first for context, but quickly pivot to outlining the optimal approach. Depth-first search on its own is rarely the answer; think about how to combine it with memoization (DP) or pruning.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases Verbally.** Before declaring your code complete, walk through 2-3 test cases. Include the empty input, single element, large values, and negative numbers if applicable. State the expected output. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches bugs before the interviewer does.

Cracking Blend’s interview is a matter of focused, pattern-based practice on medium-difficulty problems. Build fluency in the core topics, integrate them seamlessly, and communicate your thinking clearly.
