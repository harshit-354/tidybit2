When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. Adobe and Airbnb, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in terms of volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their interview question landscapes to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of documented questions.

**Adobe** has a significantly larger pool, with **227 questions** categorized by difficulty: 68 Easy, 129 Medium, and 30 Hard. This large volume suggests a broader set of potential problems and a greater emphasis on pattern recognition across many scenarios. The distribution (roughly 30% Easy, 57% Medium, 13% Hard) indicates a strong focus on Medium-level problems, which are the core of most coding interviews. You must be prepared to solve a wide variety of these efficiently.

**Airbnb** has a more concentrated set of **64 questions**: 11 Easy, 34 Medium, and 19 Hard. Notably, the proportion of Hard questions is much higher (~30%) compared to Adobe. This smaller, more challenging pool implies that Airbnb interviews may dive deeper into complex problem-solving, often involving multi-step logic or optimization. Succeeding here requires mastery of fundamentals to tackle these harder problems under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, but with different secondary focuses.

The top topics for **Adobe** are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Two Pointers**. This combination is classic for assessing clean, efficient manipulation of data. The prominence of Two Pointers signals a high frequency of problems involving searching, pairing, or sliding windows within sequences.

```python
# Adobe-style Two Pointers example: Pair with Target Sum
def pair_with_target_sum(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        if current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Adobe-style Two Pointers example: Pair with Target Sum
function pairWithTargetSum(arr, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = arr[left] + arr[right];
    if (currentSum === target) return [left, right];
    if (currentSum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Adobe-style Two Pointers example: Pair with Target Sum
public int[] pairWithTargetSum(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (currentSum == target) return new int[]{left, right};
        if (currentSum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

The top topics for **Airbnb** are **Array, Hash Table, String, and Dynamic Programming**. The inclusion of **Dynamic Programming** as a top-tier topic is a key differentiator. It points to a significant number of problems involving optimization, counting ways, or complex decision trees, which are often framed as Hard questions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Airbnb-style DP example: House Robber
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, len(nums) + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])
    return dp[len(nums)]
```

```javascript
// Airbnb-style DP example: House Robber
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = nums[0];
  for (let i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1]);
  }
  return dp[nums.length];
}
```

```java
// Airbnb-style DP example: House Robber
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length + 1];
    dp[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[nums.length];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target companies and timeline.

If you are early in your interview prep or aiming for **Adobe first**, start with its core topics. The large number of Medium problems provides excellent practice for building speed and fluency with arrays, strings, hash tables, and two-pointer techniques. This foundation is universally applicable. Once comfortable, incorporate its Hard questions and then shift focus to Airbnb's specific challenges, especially Dynamic Programming.

If your primary target is **Airbnb**, you should still begin with the core array/string/hash table fundamentals. However, you must allocate substantial time to mastering **Dynamic Programming** patterns (0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack, Fibonacci-style, LCS, etc.) and complex problem decomposition. The smaller question pool means each problem type carries more weight, so depth of understanding is critical.

For generalists preparing for both, a hybrid approach works best: build a rock-solid foundation using Adobe's extensive Medium problem set, then layer on advanced DP and problem-solving skills needed for Airbnb's Hard questions. This sequence ensures breadth before depth.
