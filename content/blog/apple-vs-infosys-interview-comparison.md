When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Apple and Infosys, while both major technology employers, have distinct interview processes reflected in their question banks. Apple's list is significantly larger and more heavily weighted toward medium and hard problems, indicating a focus on algorithmic depth and problem-solving under pressure. Infosys's list is smaller with a more balanced difficulty distribution, suggesting a strong emphasis on foundational competency and applied problem-solving. This comparison breaks down the key differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Apple's curated list of **356 questions** is more than double Infosys's **158 questions**. This volume alone suggests that Apple's process may involve a broader exploration of algorithmic concepts or a more rigorous screening phase.

The difficulty distribution reveals a sharper contrast:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** Over 70% of its questions are classified as Medium or Hard. The high proportion of Medium problems (206) indicates an interview process designed to consistently test a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. The 50 Hard problems signal that candidates for certain roles must be prepared for complex optimization challenges.
- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The distribution is more linear, with a majority still in the Medium category. The relatively higher proportion of Easy questions (compared to Apple's ratio) points to an interview that often starts with or includes more foundational checks.

In practice, an Apple interview is more likely to push you toward the optimal edge case of a known algorithm, while an Infosys interview might focus more on correctly implementing a standard solution.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize **Array**, **String**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, confirming these as universal core topics for software roles. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

- **Apple** uniquely lists **Hash Table** as a top-4 topic. This underscores the importance of efficient lookup and frequency counting in their problems, often as a key first step to optimize a brute-force solution.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common hash table pattern for frequency.
def find_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return -1
```

```javascript
// Example: A common hash table pattern for frequency.
function findDuplicate(nums) {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (seen.has(num)) return num;
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common hash table pattern for frequency.
public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (seen.contains(num)) return num;
        seen.add(num);
    }
    return -1;
}
```

</div>

- **Infosys** highlights **Math** as a top-4 topic. This suggests a greater frequency of problems involving number theory, combinatorics, or mathematical reasoning, which can sometimes be more about identifying a formula or property than implementing a complex algorithm.

The shared focus on DP is critical. You should be comfortable with classic problems and state transition.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci).
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo: return memo[n]
    if n <= 2: return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci).
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Classic DP (Fibonacci).
public int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your timeline and the role's seniority.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation cycle or targeting entry-level roles. The smaller question bank and more foundational difficulty distribution make it an excellent goal for building core competency. Mastering the Infosys list will solidify your skills in the top overlapping topics (Array, String, DP), which directly translates to a strong base for Apple. The Math focus also encourages a type of analytical thinking that is beneficial everywhere.

**Prepare for Apple first if:** You are already comfortable with standard algorithm problems and are aiming for a mid-to-senior level position, or if you have an Apple interview scheduled sooner. The extensive list and higher difficulty mean it requires a longer, more dedicated study period. Successfully working through a significant portion of Apple's questions will inherently cover the depth and breadth needed for Infosys, with the possible exception of some niche Math problems.

A strategic hybrid approach is to use the **Infosys list as your foundational curriculum**. Once you can solve most of those problems confidently, transition to the **Apple list for depth and optimization practice**. This path ensures you build a solid base before tackling the more challenging problems that Apple is known for.
