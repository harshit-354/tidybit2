Freshworks coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving with real-world relevance. You'll typically face 2-3 rounds of technical interviews, each lasting 45-60 minutes, where you'll be asked to write clean, efficient code for algorithmic problems. The emphasis is on clarity of thought, communication, and the ability to translate a problem into working code under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: 80% of questions are rated Medium, with the remaining 20% being Easy. There are no Hard problems in the typical set. This tells you exactly what to expect: the interview is designed to assess strong foundational skills and the ability to handle common, non-trivial scenarios, not obscure algorithmic minutiae. You won't need to implement a red-black tree from memory. You _will_ need to reliably solve problems involving arrays, strings, and common optimization techniques like two pointers. The absence of Hard problems means your preparation should prioritize breadth and fluency over extreme depth in niche topics. Mastery of Medium-level problems is the key to success.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The five most frequent topics form a cohesive toolkit for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, deduplication, and mapping relationships to solve problems efficiently.
- **String:** Often tested alongside arrays. Focus on character manipulation, parsing, palindrome checks, and anagram detection.
- **Two Pointers:** A critical technique for optimizing array and string problems, especially for tasks like finding pairs, removing duplicates in-place, or checking palindromes.
- **Sliding Window:** The essential pattern for solving subarray or substring problems with constraints, such as finding the longest substring with unique characters or a subarray with a target sum.

Given that **Array** and **Two Pointers/Sliding Window** are so prevalent, mastering the sliding window pattern is non-negotiable. Here is a template for the variable-size sliding window, commonly used to find the longest substring with at most K distinct characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Expand window: add char at 'right'
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # Shrink window while condition is invalid
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # Update answer (condition is valid here)
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // Expand window: add char at 'right'
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    // Shrink window while condition is invalid
    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    // Update answer (condition is valid here)
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // Expand window: add char at 'right'
        char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(rightChar, charCount.getOrDefault(rightChar, 0) + 1);

        // Shrink window while condition is invalid
        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Update answer (condition is valid here)
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate the first two weeks to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, String), solve 10-15 Easy problems to build syntax fluency, then immediately tackle 15-20 Medium problems. Implement each Two Pointers and Sliding Window pattern from scratch multiple times until the logic is automatic.

**Weeks 3-4: Mixed Practice & Problem Recognition.** Stop practicing by topic. Use platforms that provide random Medium-difficulty problems. Your goal here is to build the skill of _problem recognition_: looking at a new problem and quickly identifying it as a "sliding window" or "hash map for frequency" problem. Aim for 2-3 problems per day, focusing on clean implementation and edge cases.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Freshworks Focus.** Simulate the real environment. Do timed 45-minute sessions where you explain your thought process aloud while coding. Use a whiteboard or a simple text editor without auto-complete. In the final week, specifically practice problems tagged with "Freshworks" to familiarize yourself with their style and common problem themes.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a single line of code, restate the problem in your own words, confirm edge cases, and verbally outline your approach. Narrate your thinking as you code. This turns the interview into a collaboration.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness, Then Efficiency.** Your first goal is a working, brute-force solution. Once you have it, analyze its complexity and then optimize. A correct, suboptimal solution is far better than an elegant, buggy one.
3.  **Test with Your Own Examples.** After writing your code, don't just state it's done. Walk through a small test case, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches hidden bugs.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language Inside Out.** You don't need to know every library, but you must be fluent with core data structures (lists, maps, sets), their time/space complexities, and common methods (sorting, substring). Hesitation on syntax wastes precious time.

The Freshworks interview is a test of applied fundamentals. By methodically mastering Medium-level problems on their core topics, you build the precise toolkit needed to succeed.
