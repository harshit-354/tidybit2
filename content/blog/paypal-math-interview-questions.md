Math questions at PayPal test your ability to translate real-world financial logic into clean, efficient code. With 9 out of 106 total questions dedicated to math, it's a significant category. For a company handling payments, currency conversions, fraud detection, and risk analysis, mathematical precision is non-negotiable. Your code must correctly calculate fees, validate numerical sequences, manage percentages, and handle large datasets without floating-point errors. Strong math skills signal you can build the reliable, auditable systems that move money securely.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

PayPal's math problems are practical and finance-adjacent. You won't encounter advanced calculus, but you must be fluent in core concepts applied to algorithmic thinking.

- **Modular Arithmetic & Number Properties:** Essential for cyclic calculations, validating identifiers (like credit card numbers with Luhn's algorithm), or distributing loads. Questions often involve remainders, divisibility, and working with digits of a number.
- **Probability & Statistics:** Found in risk assessment and data analysis scenarios. You might calculate probabilities of events, work with expected values, or compute basic statistical measures (mean, median) under constraints.
- **Sequences & Series:** Identifying patterns in numerical sequences (arithmetic, geometric) or generating sequences like Fibonacci are common. These test pattern recognition and iterative/recursive thinking.
- **Basic Algebra & Equations:** Setting up and solving equations to model problems like profit splits, interest calculations, or resource allocation.
- **Optimization & Efficiency:** Many problems have a mathematical core that, if understood, allows for an O(1) or O(log n) solution instead of a brute-force O(n) approach. Spotting the formula is key.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with Code Example

Focus on translating the word problem into a mathematical model first. Before coding, ask: "Can this be expressed with a formula?" Practice mental math and working with large numbers to avoid overflow. Always consider edge cases: division by zero, negative numbers, and integer limits.

A key pattern is using the **sum formula** to avoid unnecessary loops. For example, a problem asking for the sum of numbers from 1 to N should not use a for-loop if N can be huge.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def sum_to_n(n):
    # Use the mathematical formula for O(1) efficiency
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division

# Example
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
```

```javascript
function sumToN(n) {
  // Use the mathematical formula for O(1) efficiency
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Result is a number
}

// Example
console.log(sumToN(100)); // Output: 5050
```

```java
public int sumToN(int n) {
    // Use the mathematical formula for O(1) efficiency
    return n * (n + 1) / 2; // Integer arithmetic
}

// Example
// System.out.println(sumToN(100)); // Output: 5050
```

</div>

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Foundations:** Start with basic number theory (prime checking, GCD, LCM), digit manipulation, and arithmetic series formulas.
2.  **Probability Basics:** Review counting principles, expected value, and simple probability calculations.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Practice sequence problems (Fibonacci, look-and-say) and pattern identification in matrices or grids.
4.  **Optimization:** Seek out problems where a brute-force solution exists, but a mathematical insight (like the sum formula) provides a dramatic performance gain.
5.  **PayPal-Specific Practice:** Finally, work through all 9 math questions tagged for PayPal on TidyBit to acclimate to their style and difficulty.
