Barclays coding interviews test practical problem-solving skills with a strong emphasis on data manipulation and logical reasoning. The technical assessment, often a HackerRank test, focuses on algorithmic challenges that mirror real-world financial data processing. Success hinges on efficient, clean code rather than obscure computer science theory.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Barclays questions reveals a clear pattern: **14 questions. Easy: 5 (36%), Medium: 8 (57%), Hard: 1 (7%).**

This distribution is strategic. The handful of Easy questions are warm-ups, testing basic syntax and control flow. The majority are Medium-difficulty problems designed to separate candidates. These questions require applying standard algorithms to slightly novel scenarios, often involving arrays and strings. The single Hard question is a tie-breaker; you can still pass without fully solving it, but a strong attempt demonstrates superior problem-solving under pressure. Your primary goal is to consistently and correctly solve all Easy and Medium problems.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows where Barclays concentrates its questions. Master these areas.

- **Array (Top Topic):** Ubiquitous. Expect problems involving traversal, searching, sorting, and in-place modification. Think portfolio calculations or transaction analysis.
- **String:** Often combined with array logic. Focus on parsing, validation, and transformation tasks common in processing financial messages or identifiers.
- **Matrix:** Represents grids or tables of data (e.g., risk matrices, spreadsheets). Master traversal patterns—spiral, diagonal, layer-by-layer.
- **Math:** Financial logic. Be ready for problems involving modulo arithmetic, prime numbers, sequences, and basic numerical properties.
- **Simulation:** Directly models processes. You'll be given a set of rules (like trade matching or order book updates) and must code the step-by-step outcome.

The most critical pattern across Array and Matrix problems is **in-place manipulation**. This tests your ability to optimize space, a key concern in high-volume systems. A classic example is rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise without using extra space.

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    # Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    # Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()
    return matrix
```

```javascript
function rotate(matrix) {
  const n = matrix.length;
  // Transpose the matrix
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
      [matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]] = [matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]];
    }
  }
  // Reverse each row
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    matrix[i].reverse();
  }
  return matrix;
}
```

```java
public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
    int n = matrix.length;
    // Transpose the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            int temp = matrix[i][j];
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
            matrix[j][i] = temp;
        }
    }
    // Reverse each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = matrix[i][left];
            matrix[i][left] = matrix[i][right];
            matrix[i][right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill the top topics in order: Array, String, Matrix, Math, Simulation. For each, solve 15-20 problems on a platform like TidyBit, starting with Easy and moving to Medium. Focus on understanding patterns, not memorizing solutions. Implement every solution in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Move to mixed-topic problem sets. This is where you learn to identify which pattern applies to a new problem. Time yourself. Aim for 20-25 minutes per Medium problem. Begin reviewing core data structures (Hash Maps, Sets, Queues) as they are the tools used within the main topics.

**Weeks 5-6: Assessment Simulation.** Take full 60-90 minute mock tests with Barclays-specific questions if available. Practice on HackerRank's interface to build familiarity. Revisit your incorrect problems from previous weeks. In the final days, focus on weak spots and ensure you can verbally walk through your solution logic.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness First, Optimization Second.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one with bugs. Get a working solution, then discuss and implement improvements if time allows.
2.  **Communicate Your Process.** Think out loud. Explain your initial thoughts, the trade-offs you're considering, and why you're choosing a particular approach. This turns the interview into a collaboration.
3.  **Test Your Code Mentally.** Before declaring it done, walk through your logic with a small, non-trivial example. Check edge cases: empty input, single element, large values. State these checks to the interviewer.
4.  **Write Clean, Readable Code.** Use meaningful variable names (`row` and `col` instead of `i` and `j` where helpful). Add brief comments for complex logic. This demonstrates you write maintainable code.
5.  **Know Your Language's Standard Library.** Be fluent in the utility classes for your language (e.g., `Arrays` and `Collections` in Java, `list` and `dict` methods in Python, array methods in JavaScript). It saves time and shows proficiency.

Master these patterns, execute the plan, and approach the interview as a problem-solving demonstration.
