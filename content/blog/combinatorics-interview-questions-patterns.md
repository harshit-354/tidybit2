# Combinatorics Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Combinatorics questions test your ability to count, enumerate, and reason about discrete structures. While they represent only 1-2% of typical coding interview content, they appear disproportionately at top tech companies, especially in harder interviews. These problems assess logical reasoning, mathematical intuition, and the ability to translate abstract counting problems into efficient code. Mastering a few core patterns can turn seemingly impossible problems into manageable ones.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Dynamic Programming for Counting

Many combinatorial counting problems have overlapping subproblems—classic DP territory. The key is identifying the recurrence relation that expresses the count for size `n` in terms of smaller sizes.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def count_ways_to_climb(n):
    """Count ways to climb stairs taking 1 or 2 steps."""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function countWaysToClimb(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int countWaysToClimb(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

### 2. Backtracking for Enumeration

When you need to generate all combinations, permutations, or subsets, backtracking is the standard approach. The template involves making a choice, recursing, then undoing the choice.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def generate_subsets(nums):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        result.append(path[:])
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            path.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, path)
            path.pop()
    result = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result
```

```javascript
function generateSubsets(nums) {
  const result = [];
  function backtrack(start, path) {
    result.push([...path]);
    for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
      path.push(nums[i]);
      backtrack(i + 1, path);
      path.pop();
    }
  }
  backtrack(0, []);
  return result;
}
```

```java
public List<List<Integer>> generateSubsets(int[] nums) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    backtrack(nums, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
    return result;
}

private void backtrack(int[] nums, int start, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> result) {
    result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
    for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
        path.add(nums[i]);
        backtrack(nums, i + 1, path, result);
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

</div>

### 3. Mathematical Formulas

Some problems directly translate to known formulas: combinations (nCk), permutations (nPk), or Catalan numbers. Implementing these efficiently requires understanding modular arithmetic for large numbers.

### 4. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

For counting union of overlapping sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle systematically adds and subtracts intersections. This pattern appears in problems like counting numbers divisible by certain sets of primes.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our dataset of 43 combinatorics questions shows a steep difficulty curve:

- **Easy: 3 (7%)** – Basic counting or simple enumeration.
- **Medium: 13 (30%)** – Require recognizing standard patterns like DP for counting or backtracking for generation.
- **Hard: 27 (63%)** – Involve multiple combined concepts, optimization of enumeration, or deriving non-obvious recurrence relations.

This skew toward Hard problems means combinatorics questions often serve as differentiators in later interview rounds. If you encounter one, it’s likely testing advanced problem-solving.

## Which Companies Ask Combinatorics

Combinatorics questions cluster at companies known for rigorous algorithmic interviews:

- [Google](/company/google) – Frequently asks counting problems and combinatorial optimization.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) – Uses combinatorics in problems related to system design and probability.
- [Meta](/company/meta) – Favors enumeration problems and combinatorial backtracking.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) – Appears in problems involving string permutations and game states.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) – Asks combinatorics in financial modeling and data analysis contexts.

These companies use combinatorial problems to assess structured thinking and mathematical maturity beyond standard data structure manipulation.

## Study Tips

1. **Master the Backtracking Template** – Write it from memory. Most enumeration problems are variations of this pattern. Practice generating subsets, permutations, and combinations until the recursive structure is automatic.

2. **Recognize DP Counting Problems** – When a problem asks "how many ways" and has constraints like "steps" or "choices," immediately consider DP. Write out small cases to find the recurrence relation before coding.

3. **Learn Key Formulas** – Know how to compute nCk efficiently using Pascal’s triangle (DP) or multiplicative formulas with modular inverse for large numbers. Understand when Catalan numbers apply (parentheses expressions, tree structures).

4. **Practice Enumeration Optimization** – Hard problems often require pruning invalid states early or using bitmask DP to represent subsets. Work on problems that ask for "all possible" results to build intuition for state space management.

Combinatorics questions are rare but high-impact. Focus on pattern recognition and translating counting logic into clean code.
