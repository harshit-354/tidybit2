Zepto’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design, with a clear emphasis on practical, scalable solutions. Success requires targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 28 Zepto coding questions reveals a distinct profile: a massive 82% (23 questions) are of Medium difficulty, with 14% (4 questions) Hard and only 4% (1 question) Easy. This distribution is critical. It signals that Zepto’s primary filter is your mastery of core algorithmic concepts applied to non-trivial problems. You won't be weeded out by simple syntax checks, but you must consistently solve problems that require combining multiple ideas, careful edge-case handling, and optimal time/space complexity. The Hard questions often appear in later rounds, testing depth of knowledge and resilience.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time must be prioritized. The top five topics, based on frequency, are:

1.  **Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving subarrays, rotations, and in-place manipulations.
2.  **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A major focus. You must be comfortable with both 1D and 2D DP for problems related to optimization, counting, and string manipulation.
3.  **Sorting:** Rarely just `sort()`. Think about using sorting as a pre-processing step to enable other algorithms like two-pointer or greedy approaches.
4.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Essential for tree and graph traversal, pathfinding, and backtracking in problems like permutations or exploring grids.
5.  **Binary Search:** Applied beyond sorted arrays. Master the template for searching in rotated arrays or for finding the optimal solution in an answer space (e.g., capacity planning).

Given DP's prominence, mastering a core pattern like the **0/1 Knapsack** is non-negotiable. It forms the basis for many variations.

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]],
                    dp[i-1][w]
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(
                        values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]],
                        dp[i - 1][w]
                    );
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each, solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Understand the underlying pattern, then practice variations. For example, after learning DFS, solve problems on tree paths, island count, and permutation generation.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews.** Zepto's Medium problems often blend topics. Practice problems that combine, for instance, Sorting with Two-Pointers or Binary Search with Greedy. Begin timed practice sessions. Do at least 2-3 full mock interviews per week, simulating the actual pressure.

**Weeks 5-6: Gaps, Hard Problems, and Polish.** Systematically review your weak areas. Attempt the 1-2 Hard problems from each core topic. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly—practice explaining your approach before coding, discussing trade-offs, and walking through a test case.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize from the Start.** For Medium problems, a brute-force solution is rarely sufficient. When explaining your approach, immediately discuss the optimal time and space complexity target (e.g., O(n log n) and O(1)) and work towards it.
2.  **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases.** Before coding, always ask about input size, value ranges, and data characteristics. Verbally listing edge cases (empty input, single element, large values) demonstrates thoroughness.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with clear helper functions if needed. Write clean code you'd be willing to ship.
4.  **Test with Your Own Cases.** After coding, don't wait for the interviewer. Run through a small standard case, a edge case, and a larger case verbally to validate your logic.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the key to handling Zepto's Medium-heavy question bank.
