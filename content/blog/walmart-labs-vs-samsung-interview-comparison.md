When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Walmart Labs and Samsung, while both large corporations with significant engineering needs, have distinct interview profiles based on the data from their tagged questions. Walmart Labs presents a broader, more voluminous set of problems, whereas Samsung's list is more concentrated. This comparison breaks down the key differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Walmart Labs has a catalog of **152 questions**, more than double Samsung's **69 questions**. This suggests that preparing for Walmart Labs requires covering a wider surface area of potential problems.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **Walmart Labs (E22/M105/H25):** The profile is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty, which constitutes about 69% of its questions. This aligns with a typical software engineering interview that tests core problem-solving and implementation skills under moderate constraints.
- **Samsung (E15/M37/H17):** While also Medium-heavy (roughly 54%), the distribution is slightly more balanced relative to its total volume. The emphasis remains on Medium problems, but the lower absolute number of questions means your preparation can be more focused.

In practice, this means acing Medium-difficulty problems is non-negotiable for both companies, but you will encounter a greater variety of them at a Walmart Labs interview.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong focus on fundamental data structures and algorithms. **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)** are top-tier topics for both, and **Hash Table** is also highly prevalent.

- **Walmart Labs:** The top topics are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. The high count of String questions indicates a significant emphasis on string manipulation, parsing, and related algorithms.
- **Samsung:** The top topics are **Array, Dynamic Programming, Two Pointers, and Hash Table**. The notable inclusion of **Two Pointers** as a top-4 topic suggests Samsung frequently uses problems involving sorted data, palindromes, or sliding windows.

This overlap means a strong core foundation serves you well for both. However, you should tailor your deep dives:

- For **Walmart Labs**, ensure you are exceptionally comfortable with a wide range of String problems.
- For **Samsung**, dedicate extra practice to **Two Pointers** and sliding window techniques.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common at Samsung)
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

# Example: Hash Table (common at both)
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Samsung)
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example: Hash Table (common at both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Samsung)
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Example: Hash Table (common at both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the desire for efficient study.

**Prepare for Samsung first if:** You are interviewing with both or want to build fundamentals. The smaller, more concentrated question set for Samsung allows you to build core competency in Array, DP, and Two Pointers efficiently. Mastering these 69 questions, especially the Medium ones, creates a solid foundation that translates directly to a large portion of the Walmart Labs list.

**Prepare for Walmart Labs first if:** It is your primary target. Due to its larger volume, starting here will naturally cover most of the high-frequency topics you'd see at Samsung. The extra effort required for String problems and the broader question variety will mean that switching to Samsung preparation later will feel like a focused review, particularly on Two Pointers.

The most strategic path is to **master the shared core topics (Array, DP, Hash Table)**, then branch out: deep dive into **Two Pointers** for Samsung, and **String** manipulation for Walmart Labs. This approach ensures you are well-prepared for either company's technical screen.
