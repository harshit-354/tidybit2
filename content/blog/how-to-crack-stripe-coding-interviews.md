Stripe’s coding interviews are designed to assess your ability to build robust, scalable systems and solve practical, product-adjacent problems. The process typically involves 1-2 technical phone screens focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, followed by a virtual onsite with rounds covering system design, debugging, and more coding. The emphasis is less on obscure computer science trivia and more on clean, correct, and maintainable code that handles edge cases gracefully. Understanding their core engineering values—reliability, clarity, and user-centric thinking—is as important as mastering algorithms.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent Stripe interview questions, the difficulty distribution is revealing: 10% Easy, 80% Medium, and 10% Hard. This distribution tells a clear story. Stripe is primarily evaluating your core competency and consistency. The overwhelming focus on Medium-difficulty problems means they are testing for strong fundamentals, the ability to navigate common but non-trivial algorithmic patterns, and clean implementation under moderate time pressure. The single Hard problem likely appears in later rounds to differentiate top candidates, testing advanced problem-solving or optimization on a familiar concept. The near-absence of Easy questions signals there’s no warm-up; you are expected to be technically sharp from the start.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a practical toolkit for backend and API-centric engineering: **Array** (20%), **String** (20%), **Graph Theory** (20%), **Hash Table** (15%), and **Depth-First Search** (10%). This isn't about exotic data structures; it's about manipulating core data (arrays, strings), efficient lookups (hash tables), and modeling relationships (graphs).

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock of data representation. Expect problems involving parsing, transformation, sliding windows, or two-pointer techniques. Mastery here is non-negotiable.
- **Graph Theory:** Stripe's systems often model relationships between entities like users, payments, and events. Graph problems test your ability to reason about these connections, whether for traversal, cycle detection, or state transitions.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups and frequency counting. It's frequently the key to optimizing a brute-force array or string solution.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** As a subset of Graph Theory, DFS is essential for exploring all possibilities in a state space, traversing trees, or solving backtracking problems common in feature logic.

A quintessential Stripe pattern combines several of these: using a hash table to map relationships and then performing a DFS to explore or validate a structure. This is common in problems involving dependency resolution or hierarchical data validation.

    for task, prereq in prerequisites:
        graph[task].append(prereq)

    state = [0] * num_tasks  # 0=unvisited, 1=visiting, 2=visited

    def has_cycle(task):
        if state[task] == 1:
            return True  # Cycle detected

            if has_cycle(task):
                return False

```javascript
function canFinishTasks(numTasks, prerequisites) {
  // Build adjacency list
  const graph = new Array(numTasks).fill(0).map(() => []);
  for (const [task, prereq] of prerequisites) {
    graph[task].push(prereq);
  }

  const state = new Array(numTasks).fill(0); // 0=unvisited, 1=visiting, 2=visited

  function hasCycle(task) {
    if (state[task] === 1) return true;
    if (state[task] === 2) return false;

    state[task] = 1; // visiting
    for (const prereq of graph[task]) {
      if (hasCycle(prereq)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    state[task] = 2; // visited
    return false;
  }

  for (let task = 0; task < numTasks; task++) {
    if (state[task] === 0) {
      if (hasCycle(task)) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TaskScheduler {
    public boolean canFinish(int numTasks, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // Build graph
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            graph.get(pre[0]).add(pre[1]);
        }

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this time exclusively to the top five topics. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, focusing on Medium difficulty. For each problem, implement the solution in your primary language, then analyze time/space complexity. Practice verbally walking through your reasoning before coding.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews.** Start solving problems that blend topics (e.g., array + hash table, graph + DFS). Begin doing timed, full-session mock interviews (2-3 per week) covering 2-3 Medium problems back-to-back to simulate the Stripe onsite intensity. Use platforms that provide Stripe-tagged questions.

**Weeks 5-6: Refinement & System Design.** Polish your performance. Revisit previously solved problems to write cleaner, more production-ready code with thorough error handling. Dedicate 30% of your time in the final two weeks to basic system design principles, as Stripe often integrates these concepts into coding discussions (e.g., "how would you scale this?").

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity Over Cleverness.** Stripe values readable, maintainable code. Use descriptive variable names, write helper functions, and comment on non-obvious logic. A correct, clear solution is better than a bug-optimal one.
2.  **Talk Through Edge Cases Early and Often.** Before you start coding, verbally identify edge cases: empty inputs, large values, duplicate data, cycle conditions in graphs. Proactively addressing these demonstrates the thoroughness required for financial systems.
3.  **Connect the Problem to a Real-World Scenario.** When explaining your solution, briefly frame it in a Stripe context. For a graph problem, mention "modeling payment dependencies"; for a string parsing problem, discuss "handling webhook payloads." This shows product intuition.
4.  **Practice Writing Code on a Whiteboard or Simple Text Editor.** The interview environment often lacks IDE autocomplete. Be comfortable writing syntactically correct code in a plain text field, including proper brackets and semicolons.

Mastering these focused areas and adopting a systematic, clarity-first approach will position you strongly for Stripe's technical assessment. For targeted practice, browse our curated list of problems directly from their interview loop.
