When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study process. Yandex and EPAM Systems, while both prominent in the software industry, present distinct interview landscapes. Yandex, a Russian multinational known for its search engine and diverse tech products, conducts rigorous, algorithm-heavy interviews similar to other FAANG-tier companies. EPAM Systems, a global provider of digital platform engineering and software development services, tends to have a strong focus on practical coding skills and foundational data structures. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty, and topical emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of documented questions and their difficulty distribution.

**Yandex** has a larger question pool with approximately **134 questions**, categorized as Easy (52), Medium (72), and Hard (10). This larger volume suggests a broader range of potential problems and indicates that interviews may involve multiple rounds of in-depth algorithmic problem-solving. The distribution (E52/M72/H10) shows a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty questions, which are typical for assessing a candidate's core problem-solving and implementation skills under constraints.

**EPAM Systems** has a smaller, more focused set of around **51 questions**, with a breakdown of Easy (19), Medium (30), and Hard (2). The significantly lower number of Hard questions suggests that while technical proficiency is required, the interviews may not routinely delve into the most complex algorithmic territory. The focus is heavily weighted toward Medium problems, testing solid, practical application of data structures.

In short, preparing for Yandex requires readiness for a wider array of problems, including a non-trivial number of challenging ones. EPAM preparation can be more targeted, with deep mastery of Medium-level concepts being paramount.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test four fundamental areas: **Array, String, Two Pointers, and Hash Table**. This overlap means core preparation in these topics is efficient for interviews at either company.

- **Array and String** manipulation is universal. Expect questions on searching, sorting, and subsequence problems.
- **Hash Table** is critical for optimizing lookups and solving frequency-counting problems.
- **Two Pointers** is a essential technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists, often related to searching for pairs or palindromes.

The primary difference lies in the depth and context. Yandex, given its larger pool and Hard questions, is more likely to combine these topics in complex ways or integrate them with other advanced patterns (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graphs) not listed in the core four. EPAM's questions are more likely to apply these core topics in a direct, practical manner relevant to backend or application development.

For example, a classic "Two Pointers" problem might appear at both companies:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

At Yandex, this might be a warm-up; at EPAM, it could be a central question.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and timeline.

**Prepare for EPAM Systems first if:** You are newer to technical interviews or are on a tighter schedule. The smaller, more focused question bank allows you to achieve a high level of readiness for their specific pattern of questions more quickly. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Two Pointers) to a Medium level of proficiency will cover a substantial portion of their question bank.

**Prepare for Yandex first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech roles or have more preparation time. The extensive question pool and higher difficulty ceiling mean preparation is more demanding and time-consuming. However, the breadth and depth required for Yandex will inherently cover nearly all the ground needed for an EPAM interview. Succeeding in Yandex-level practice effectively supersedes preparation for the less intensive EPAM-style interview.

In essence, EPAM preparation is a strong, focused foundation. Yandex preparation is a comprehensive, high-ceiling training regimen. Choose based on your ultimate goal and the complexity of the role you are targeting.
