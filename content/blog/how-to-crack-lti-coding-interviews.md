Landing a role at Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI) requires clearing their technical interview, which is a focused assessment of your problem-solving and coding skills. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you'll be asked to solve algorithmic problems on a whiteboard or in a shared online editor. Success hinges on demonstrating clean, efficient code and logical thinking under pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, LTI's coding questions are distributed as follows:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (33%)
- **Medium:** 3 questions (50%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (17%)

This breakdown is strategic. The easy questions are warm-ups, testing basic syntax and logic. The medium questions form the core of the evaluation, assessing your grasp of standard algorithms and data structures. The single hard question is the differentiator, used to identify top candidates who can handle complex optimization. Your goal is to consistently ace the easy and medium problems. Solving the hard problem correctly will put you in the top tier, but a strong, optimal solution on the mediums is often sufficient to pass.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequently tested areas are predictable. Master these to cover the majority of question content.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect questions on traversal, manipulation, and subarray problems.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for more complex problems. Know the built-in sorts and when to use custom comparators.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, modular arithmetic, or basic computations. They test logical reasoning more than complex algorithms.
- **Two Pointers:** A crucial technique for optimizing array and string problems, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Dynamic Programming:** The key topic for medium and hard problems, especially for optimization questions like "find the minimum/maximum" or "count the number of ways."

The **Two Pointers** technique is particularly emblematic of LTI's focus on efficient array manipulation. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # 'write' pointer places the next unique element
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write  # New length
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a week-by-week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Focus exclusively on Easy and Medium problems from the core topics: Array, Sorting, Math, and Two Pointers. Solve 2-3 problems daily. Don't just code—practice explaining your approach aloud as you would in an interview.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Algorithms.** Dive into Dynamic Programming. Start with classic problems (Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence) to understand memoization and tabulation. Simultaneously, begin mixing in problems from other common categories like Strings and Hash Maps. Aim for 1-2 problems daily, ensuring deep understanding.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new patterns. Use this phase for revision and simulation. Solve complete problem sets that mimic LTI's distribution (2 Easy, 3 Medium, 1 Hard) within a 60-75 minute timer. Practice on a whiteboard or plain text editor without auto-complete. Analyze every mistake.

## Key Tips

1.  **Clarify First, Code Later.** Before writing a single line, ask clarifying questions. What are the input boundaries? What should be returned for edge cases? A clear example walkthrough demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Optimize Deliberately.** Start with a brute-force solution and state its complexity. Then, methodically improve it. This shows a progression in your thought process and is better than jumping to an imperfect "optimal" solution.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include consistent indentation, and write clean helper functions. Comment briefly on complex logic. This code is your primary deliverable.
4.  **Test with Your Own Cases.** After coding, don't wait for the interviewer. Walk through your code with a small normal case, a large case, and edge cases (empty input, single element, sorted/reversed order). Verbally state the expected output at each step.
5.  **Manage Your Time.** Allocate time based on difficulty. If stuck on a problem for more than 10 minutes, state your blocker and propose a simplified approach or ask if you can move on. Showing awareness is better than silent struggle.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the most reliable method to build the speed and accuracy needed to pass. Understand the patterns, internalize the code, and practice the performance.
