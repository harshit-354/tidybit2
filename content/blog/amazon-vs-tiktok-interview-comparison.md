When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns matter. Amazon and TikTok represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of scale and focus, which is directly reflected in their interview question libraries. Amazon's list is massive and well-established, while TikTok's is smaller and more concentrated. Understanding the differences in volume, difficulty, and topic focus will help you allocate your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a clear story. Amazon's list of **1,938 questions** dwarfs TikTok's **383**. This volume is a function of Amazon's longer history, larger number of interviews conducted, and vast array of teams and roles.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different profiles:

- **Amazon (E530/M1057/H351):** The difficulty is heavily weighted toward **Medium** questions, which make up over 54% of their list. This aligns with Amazon's well-known focus on practical, scalable problem-solving. The significant number of Hard questions (18%) often relates to system design principles or complex optimizations.
- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The distribution is even more skewed toward **Medium** difficulty, which constitutes nearly 68% of their list. The Hard questions are present but form a smaller proportion (21%). This suggests TikTok's technical screen heavily tests strong, applied coding skills on non-trivial problems, with a slightly narrower scope for extreme algorithmic complexity than Amazon's hardest questions.

In short, Amazon's challenge is breadth within a vast pool, while TikTok's is depth within a more focused, medium-difficulty set.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume difference, both companies concentrate on the same core data structures and algorithms. The top topics are identical: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**.

This overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both interviews. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays and strings, using hash maps for efficient lookups, and applying dynamic programming to optimization problems. The coding patterns you learn for one company will directly apply to the other.

The primary difference lies in the _context and application_. Amazon questions frequently incorporate concepts related to scalability, data processing, and real-world system behavior (e.g., designing a parking lot, merging log files). TikTok, given its social media and video focus, may lean slightly more toward problems involving feeds, sequences, graphs (for social networks), and string processing, but the underlying algorithmic patterns remain from the core four topics.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A Hash Table problem relevant to both companies
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# This pattern is fundamental for both Amazon and TikTok interviews.
```

```javascript
// Example: A Hash Table problem relevant to both companies
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A Hash Table problem relevant to both companies
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

You should **prepare for Amazon first**. Here’s why: mastering Amazon's extensive question list will inherently cover the core topics and difficulty level required for TikTok. The vast pool of Amazon Medium questions will solidify your problem-solving skills on the exact patterns (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) that TikTok emphasizes. If you can handle the breadth and occasional depth of Amazon's list, transitioning to TikTok's more concentrated set will feel like focusing on a key subset.

A strategic plan is:

1.  Build a foundation using the core topics common to both.
2.  Practice extensively from Amazon's Medium and common Hard questions. This builds stamina and pattern recognition.
3.  Closer to a TikTok interview, target their specific question list to familiarize yourself with their problem style and common question variations.

This approach maximizes efficiency, using the broader Amazon preparation as a comprehensive training ground that makes subsequent, more focused preparation easier.
