When preparing for technical interviews at major e-commerce platforms, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution of their coding questions is crucial for efficient study. Both Flipkart and eBay emphasize core data structures and algorithms, but their question banks on platforms like TidyBit reveal distinct profiles in volume, difficulty, and topical emphasis. This comparison analyzes their tagged interview questions to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Flipkart’s question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With **117 total questions** (117q), it nearly doubles eBay’s count. The difficulty distribution—**Easy: 13, Medium: 73, Hard: 31** (E13/M73/H31)—shows a heavy skew toward Medium and Hard problems. This indicates that Flipkart interviews are designed to rigorously test problem-solving depth, algorithmic optimization, and handling edge cases. Success here requires comfort with complex scenarios beyond foundational knowledge.

eBay’s question set is more compact at **60 total questions**, with a distribution of **Easy: 12, Medium: 38, Hard: 10** (E12/M38/H10). While still medium-dominant, the proportion of Hard questions is lower. This suggests eBay’s technical screen might prioritize strong foundational competency and clean implementation over solving the most complex algorithmic puzzles, though medium-level mastery remains essential.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies strongly focus on **Array** and **Hash Table** problems, which are fundamental for handling data retrieval, manipulation, and optimization—core to e-commerce systems like product catalogs, shopping carts, and user sessions. **Sorting** is also a shared key topic, often used in tandem with other structures.

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table + Array pattern (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table + Array pattern (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table + Array pattern (Two Sum)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

The main divergence is Flipkart’s explicit inclusion of **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest increasing subsequence) are classic hard-level challenges that test advanced optimization and state management. eBay’s list highlights **String** manipulation, which involves medium-difficulty problems around parsing, searching, and matching—common in processing user input, search queries, and item descriptions.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **eBay**. Its smaller, slightly less difficult question set allows you to solidify the absolute fundamentals—Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting—in a high-pressure, medium-difficulty context. Mastering these 60 questions builds a robust core competency that is directly transferable.

Then, transition to **Flipkart**. Use your strong foundation to tackle its larger volume of Medium problems and the significant set of Hard questions. The addition of Dynamic Programming requires dedicated study of new patterns (memoization, tabulation). Preparing for Flipkart after eBay effectively layers advanced concepts onto a solid base, whereas the reverse could be overwhelming.

In summary, eBay serves as an excellent training ground for core data structure fluency under interview conditions. Flipkart then demands that you scale that fluency to more complex, optimized solutions. Master the shared topics first, then branch into each company’s specialties: String practice for eBay, DP deep-dives for Flipkart.
