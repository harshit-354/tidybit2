# Heap (Priority Queue) Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

Heaps, or Priority Queues, are a critical data structure for coding interviews because they efficiently solve problems involving ordering, scheduling, and finding extremes. Unlike a standard queue (FIFO), a priority queue processes elements based on their priority, making it ideal for real-time systems, task scheduling, and algorithms like Dijkstra's. Interviewers love heaps because they test your ability to recognize when a brute-force O(n²) solution can be optimized to O(n log k) with the right data structure. Mastering a few core patterns will let you tackle the majority of problems.

## Common Patterns

Most heap questions fall into a few recognizable categories. Learn these patterns to quickly map a problem to a solution.

**Pattern 1: Top K Elements**
This is the most frequent pattern. Use a _Min-Heap_ to find the top K largest elements or a _Max-Heap_ for the top K smallest. The key is to maintain the heap size at K to achieve O(n log k) time.

<div class="code-group">

```python
import heapq

def top_k_largest(nums, k):
    min_heap = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # Remove smallest
    return min_heap  # Contains K largest
```

```javascript
function topKLargest(nums, k) {
  const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue(); // Using library
  for (let num of nums) {
    minHeap.enqueue(num);
    if (minHeap.size() > k) {
      minHeap.dequeue(); // Remove smallest
    }
  }
  return minHeap.toArray().map((item) => item.element);
}
```

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public List<Integer> topKLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        minHeap.offer(num);
        if (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.poll(); // Remove smallest
        }
    }
    return new ArrayList<>(minHeap);
}
```

</div>

**Pattern 2: K-way Merge**
Merge K sorted lists or arrays efficiently by using a Min-Heap to always track the smallest available element across all lists.

**Pattern 3: Two Heaps (Median Finder)**
Maintain two heaps: a Max-Heap for the lower half of numbers and a Min-Heap for the upper half. This allows O(1) access to the median and O(log n) insertion.

<div class="code-group">

```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lo = []  # max-heap (invert values)
        self.hi = []  # min-heap

    def addNum(self, num):
        heapq.heappush(self.lo, -num)
        heapq.heappush(self.hi, -heapq.heappop(self.lo))
        if len(self.hi) > len(self.lo):
            heapq.heappush(self.lo, -heapq.heappop(self.hi))

    def findMedian(self):
        if len(self.lo) > len(self.hi):
            return -self.lo[0]
        return (-self.lo[0] + self.hi[0]) / 2
```

```javascript
// Using two heaps with a library
class MedianFinder {
  constructor() {
    this.lo = new MaxPriorityQueue();
    this.hi = new MinPriorityQueue();
  }
  addNum(num) {
    this.lo.enqueue(num);
    this.hi.enqueue(this.lo.dequeue().element);
    if (this.lo.size() < this.hi.size()) {
      this.lo.enqueue(this.hi.dequeue().element);
    }
  }
  findMedian() {
    return this.lo.size() > this.hi.size()
      ? this.lo.front().element
      : (this.lo.front().element + this.hi.front().element) / 2;
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

class MedianFinder {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> lo; // max-heap
    PriorityQueue<Integer> hi; // min-heap

    public MedianFinder() {
        lo = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        hi = new PriorityQueue<>();
    }
    public void addNum(int num) {
        lo.offer(num);
        hi.offer(lo.poll());
        if (lo.size() < hi.size()) {
            lo.offer(hi.poll());
        }
    }
    public double findMedian() {
        return lo.size() > hi.size()
            ? lo.peek()
            : (lo.peek() + hi.peek()) / 2.0;
    }
}
```

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data set of 167 questions shows a clear distribution: Easy (15, 9%), Medium (94, 56%), Hard (58, 35%). This split is telling.

Medium problems dominate because they perfectly test the application of heap patterns to non-obvious scenarios, like scheduling or greedy algorithms. You need to recognize the heap's role within a larger solution. The significant portion of Hard problems (35%) indicates that heaps are often a component in complex system design or advanced graph algorithms (e.g., finding the shortest path with constraints). Don't skip the Hard problems; practice them to see how heaps integrate with other structures.

## Which Companies Ask Heap (Priority Queue)

Heaps are a staple at top tech companies, especially for roles involving systems, infrastructure, or data processing.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks heap questions for system design and optimization problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) uses them in questions related to order processing and resource scheduling.
- [Meta](/company/meta) tests heaps in contexts like task scheduling for servers or feed ranking.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) often include heap problems in their interviews for financial data streaming and real-time analytics.

## Study Tips

1.  **Internalize the Two Heap Types:** Know that a Min-Heap gives you the smallest element in O(1) time. In Python, `heapq` is a Min-Heap by default; for a Max-Heap, invert values. In Java, use `PriorityQueue` for Min-Heap and `Collections.reverseOrder()` for Max-Heap.
2.  **Pattern First, Implementation Second:** When you read a problem, ask: "Is this about top K elements? Merging lists? Finding a running median?" Match it to a pattern before writing code.
3.  **Practice Time Complexity Analysis:** Be ready to explain why your heap solution is O(n log k) instead of O(n log n). This shows deeper understanding.
4.  **Combine with Other Structures:** Hard problems often combine heaps with hash maps (for frequency) or graphs. Practice these hybrids.
