String manipulation is a core skill for PayPal engineers because financial transactions are fundamentally about processing and validating textual data. Payment gateways handle credit card numbers, CVV codes, expiration dates, billing addresses, and transaction descriptions—all as strings. Engineers must parse, sanitize, validate, and format this data with absolute precision to ensure security, prevent fraud, and comply with financial regulations. A single off-by-one error in a string operation could misroute a payment or expose sensitive information. With 27 out of 106 tagged questions on TidyBit focusing on strings, PayPal’s interview process consistently tests this foundational competency.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

PayPal’s string questions typically fall into three categories, often combining elements of each.

1.  **Validation & Parsing:** Directly mirroring real-world tasks, these problems ask you to verify the format of input. Common examples include validating email addresses, checking if a credit card number passes a Luhn check, or parsing a log file string to extract transaction IDs.
2.  **Encoding & Transformation:** These problems test your ability to systematically modify string data. You might be asked to encode a string using Run-Length Encoding (RLE), format a number as currency with commas, or implement a basic cipher.
3.  **Pattern Matching & Searching:** Often the most algorithmically complex, these involve finding substrings, anagrams, or palindromes within larger texts. A classic example is finding all occurrences of a pattern (like a specific error code) within a long transaction log. These questions assess your grasp of efficient searching algorithms.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on mastering a few key patterns rather than memorizing solutions. Practice using two-pointer techniques for in-place manipulation, sliding windows for substring problems, and hash maps for counting characters. Always clarify edge cases: empty strings, null inputs, case sensitivity, and alphanumeric characters.

A fundamental pattern is the **Two-Pointer Technique**, often used for checking palindromes—a common warm-up question. The idea is to use one pointer starting at the beginning and another at the end, moving them inward while comparing characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric chars (common variation)
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left, right = left + 1, right - 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Skip non-alphanumeric chars
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) left++;
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) right--;
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Skip non-alphanumeric chars
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Start with basic manipulation (reversal, anagrams) to build confidence. Move to validation problems (valid palindrome, valid number) to practice careful condition handling. Then tackle medium-difficulty pattern matching (longest substring without repeating characters, find all anagrams). Finally, attempt complex parsing simulations, like implementing a basic CSV parser or a simplified version of the Luhn algorithm. This progression builds from syntax fluency to algorithmic thinking.
