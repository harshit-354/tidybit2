When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are prioritized. Uber and Infosys, representing a top-tier product-based company and a major global IT services firm respectively, have distinct interview landscapes. Analyzing their question banks on TidyBit shows clear differences in volume, difficulty, and focus, which should directly inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a significant disparity in the number of documented questions. Uber's list contains **381 questions**, more than double Infosys's **158 questions**. This higher volume for Uber reflects its reputation for a rigorous, competitive interview process with a broader pool of potential problems.

The difficulty distribution is also telling:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103):** The majority of questions are Medium (224) or Hard (103). Only about 14% are categorized as Easy. This indicates Uber interviews heavily test complex problem-solving and optimization under pressure.
- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The distribution is more balanced, with a larger proportion of Easy questions (about 27%). While Medium questions still form the core, the presence of more foundational problems suggests the process may also assess core programming competency alongside advanced algorithms.

This contrast means preparing for Uber requires deep mastery and extensive practice on challenging problems, while Infosys preparation should cover a solid base with a strong focus on medium-tier challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array**, **String**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, confirming these as universal pillars of coding interviews.

- **Shared Focus:** Arrays and Strings are fundamental data structures for testing logic and edge-case handling. Dynamic Programming is a key paradigm for optimization problems. Success with both companies demands fluency here.
  <div class="code-group">
  ```python
  # Example: A common DP pattern (Fibonacci)
  def fib(n, memo={}):
      if n in memo: return memo[n]
      if n <= 2: return 1
      memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
      return memo[n]
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Example: A common DP pattern (Fibonacci)
  function fib(n, memo = {}) {
      if (n in memo) return memo[n];
      if (n <= 2) return 1;
      memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
      return memo[n];
  }
  ```
  ```java
  // Example: A common DP pattern (Fibonacci)
  public int fib(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
      if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
      if (n <= 2) return 1;
      int result = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
      memo.put(n, result);
      return result;
  }
  ```
  </div>

- **Key Differentiator:** Uber uniquely lists **Hash Table** as a top topic. This highlights their emphasis on efficient lookup, frequency counting, and solving problems involving mappings—often crucial for optimizing solutions to Hard problems. Infosys, conversely, highlights **Math**, pointing to a greater likelihood of numerical, combinatorial, or basic arithmetic problems testing logical reasoning.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target role and experience level.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting IT services roles. The relatively balanced difficulty and smaller question bank allow you to build confidence. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, DP, Math) to a medium level will create a strong foundation that is also transferable.

**Prepare for Uber first if:** You are aiming for competitive product-based or tech-first companies. The depth and breadth required will force you to raise your standard. Thorough preparation for Uber—drilling into Hash Table problems, mastering complex DP variations, and practicing under time constraints—will inherently cover the core of the Infosys curriculum. The reverse is not true; preparing only for Infosys will likely leave you under-prepared for Uber's harder problems.

In essence, use Infosys's pattern to solidify your fundamentals. Use Uber's pattern to stress-test and advance your algorithmic problem-solving to a high level. Tailor your final practice sessions to the specific company's highlighted topics.
