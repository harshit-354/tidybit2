When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study process. Salesforce and Snapchat, while both prominent in the tech landscape, present distinct interview profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics tested. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question patterns to help you prioritize and focus your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of tagged questions is the most immediate difference. On TidyBit, Salesforce has **189 questions**, nearly double Snapchat's **99 questions**. This larger pool suggests a broader range of potential problems you might encounter, requiring more extensive practice to cover the spread.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring emphases:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty (113 out of 189 questions, or ~60%). This indicates that a strong, consistent performance on medium-complexity problems involving core data structures and algorithms is the primary gate. Hard questions exist but are less frequent.
- **Snapchat (E6/M62/H31):** The distribution skews even more toward challenging problems. While Mediums are still the majority (62 out of 99, ~63%), the proportion of **Hard** questions is significantly higher (~31% vs. Salesforce's ~26%). The low number of Easy questions (only 6) signals that interviews are designed to test advanced problem-solving from the outset.

In short, Salesforce demands high-volume, consistent competency, while Snapchat's smaller batch is concentrated on higher-difficulty problem-solving.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are critical for interviews at either company. Mastering these is non-negotiable.

The key differentiator lies in the next layer of topics:

- **Salesforce** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with its enterprise software background, where optimizing complex, often recursive, processes (like resource allocation or workflow paths) is valuable. Expect problems involving memoization and tabulation.
- **Snapchat** emphasizes **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This is intuitive for a social media and messaging platform where features involve traversing networks (friend graphs, story views, shortest path in a network). You must be adept at applying BFS, often in matrix or graph problems.

```python
# Example DP pattern (common for Salesforce)
def climb_stairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

# Example BFS pattern (common for Snapchat)
from collections import deque
def bfs_grid(grid, start):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]

    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        # Process cell (r, c)
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
```

```javascript
// Example DP pattern (common for Salesforce)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Example BFS pattern (common for Snapchat)
function bfsGrid(grid, start) {
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set();
  visited.add(`${start[0]},${start[1]}`);
  const directions = [
    [1, 0],
    [-1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
  ];

  while (queue.length) {
    const [r, c] = queue.shift();
    // Process cell (r, c)
    for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
      const nr = r + dr,
        nc = c + dc;
      const key = `${nr},${nc}`;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.has(key)) {
        visited.add(key);
        queue.push([nr, nc]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```java
// Example DP pattern (common for Salesforce)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Example BFS pattern (common for Snapchat)
import java.util.*;
public void bfsGrid(int[][] grid, int[] start) {
    int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
    queue.offer(start);
    visited.add(start[0] + "," + start[1]);
    int[][] directions = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int[] cell = queue.poll();
        int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];
        // Process cell (r, c)
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
            String key = nr + "," + nc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && !visited.contains(key)) {
                visited.add(key);
                queue.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and your foundational strength.

**Prepare for Salesforce first if:** Your goal is to get a broad base of practice. The high volume of Medium-difficulty questions provides excellent general interview preparation. Solidifying your skills on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and especially **Dynamic Programming** will build a strong foundation that is transferable to many other companies, including Snapchat.

**Prepare for Snapchat first if:** You are specifically targeting Snapchat or similar product-based companies (Meta, TikTok). The concentrated focus on higher-difficulty problems means you need deep mastery of core topics and advanced graph traversal techniques like **Breadth-First Search**. Succeeding here often requires more sophisticated optimization and cleaner code under pressure.

A practical strategy is to **build a foundation with Salesforce's pattern (high-volume Mediums, focus on DP) and then intensify with Snapchat's pattern (higher proportion of Hards, focus on BFS)**. This approach ensures you are robust on fundamentals before tackling the most challenging problems.
