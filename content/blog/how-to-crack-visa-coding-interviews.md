Landing a software engineering role at Visa means passing a rigorous technical interview. The process typically involves multiple rounds focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design, with a strong emphasis on clean, efficient code under pressure. Your success hinges on targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers

An analysis of 124 reported Visa coding questions reveals a clear pattern. The difficulty distribution is 26% Easy, 58% Medium, and 16% Hard. This breakdown is crucial for your strategy.

The 58% majority of Medium problems is your primary battleground. Visa uses these questions to assess core competency—your ability to apply standard data structures to slightly twisted problems within a reasonable timeframe. The 16% Hard questions are the differentiators, often appearing in later rounds for senior candidates or for particularly competitive openings. Do not neglect Easy problems (26%); they are frequently used in initial screening calls to quickly filter for fundamental coding fluency. The takeaway: Master the Medium tier to advance, but be prepared for a Hard problem to secure the offer.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Visa's problem selection shows a strong preference for foundational topics. Prioritize these five.

- **Array:** This is the most frequent topic. Expect manipulations, subarray problems, and two-pointer techniques. Your code must handle edge cases cleanly.
- **String:** Often paired with Array in frequency. Focus on traversal, pattern matching, and anagram problems. Know how to efficiently build and compare strings.
- **Hash Table:** The indispensable tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Be ready to use it for frequency counting, complement finding (like two-sum), and deduplication. It's often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just about calling `.sort()`. Understand how sorting can be a pre-processing step to enable other algorithms (like two-pointer) and be fluent with custom comparators.
- **Dynamic Programming:** The most complex of the common topics. Visa's DP problems often relate to classic patterns (knapsack, longest common subsequence) or array-based optimizations. Start with the fundamentals before tackling company-specific variations.

### Deep Dive with Code Examples

Let's explore a classic problem for each of these top topics with practical, multi-language implementations. This will help you understand the patterns and the clean code style expected.

**1. Array - Two Sum (Using Hash Table)**
This problem perfectly combines the Array and Hash Table topics. The optimal solution uses a hash map to store seen numbers and their indices, allowing us to find the complement in O(1) time.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    Assumes exactly one solution exists.
    """
    num_map = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # Should never reach here per problem constraint

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map(); // value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // Should never reach here per problem constraint
}

// Example usage
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // value -> index
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { numMap.get(complement), i };
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        // Per problem constraints, we assume a solution exists
        return new int[] {};
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
        int target = 9;
        int[] result = sol.twoSum(nums, target);
        System.out.println("[" + result[0] + ", " + result[1] + "]"); // Output: [0, 1]
    }
}
```

</div>

**2. String - Valid Anagram**
A common string problem that tests your ability to compare character frequencies efficiently. The optimal solution uses a frequency array (or hash table) to count characters.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_anagram(s, t):
    """
    Returns True if t is an anagram of s.
    An Anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another.
    """
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    # Use a fixed-size array for 26 lowercase letters (adjust for full ASCII if needed)
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        char_count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        index = ord(char) - ord('a')
        char_count[index] -= 1
        if char_count[index] < 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
print(is_anagram("anagram", "nagaram"))  # Output: True
print(is_anagram("rat", "car"))          # Output: False
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

  const charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
  const baseCharCode = "a".charCodeAt(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    charCount[s.charCodeAt(i) - baseCharCode]++;
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
    const index = t.charCodeAt(i) - baseCharCode;
    charCount[index]--;
    if (charCount[index] < 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example usage
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car")); // false
```

```java
public class AnagramChecker {
    public static boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

        int[] charCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            charCount[index]--;
            if (charCount[index] < 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // true
        System.out.println(isAnagram("rat", "car"));         // false
    }
}
```

</div>

**3. Sorting - Meeting Rooms (Interval Problem)**
A classic problem that uses sorting as a pre-processing step. Sorting intervals by their start time allows for a single pass to check for overlaps.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def can_attend_meetings(intervals):
    """
    Returns True if a person can attend all meetings (no overlapping intervals).
    intervals is a list of [start, end] lists.
    """
    # Sort intervals by their start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        # If the current meeting starts before the previous one ends
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
meetings1 = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(can_attend_meetings(meetings1))  # Output: False (overlap between [0,30] and [5,10])

meetings2 = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
print(can_attend_meetings(meetings2))  # Output: True (no overlap after sorting)
```

```javascript
function canAttendMeetings(intervals) {
  // Sort intervals by start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    // If current meeting starts before previous ends
    if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

// Example usage
const meetings1 = [
  [0, 30],
  [5, 10],
  [15, 20],
];
console.log(canAttendMeetings(meetings1)); // false

const meetings2 = [
  [7, 10],
  [2, 4],
];
console.log(canAttendMeetings(meetings2)); // true
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class MeetingRooms {
    public static boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
        // Sort intervals by start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            // If current meeting starts before previous ends
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] meetings1 = {{0, 30}, {5, 10}, {15, 20}};
        System.out.println(canAttendMeetings(meetings1)); // false

        int[][] meetings2 = {{7, 10}, {2, 4}};
        System.out.println(canAttendMeetings(meetings2)); // true
    }
}
```

</div>

**4. Dynamic Programming - Climbing Stairs**
A foundational DP problem that introduces the concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It's essentially finding the nth Fibonacci number.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    """
    Returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of n stairs,
    where you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Uses constant space DP (Fibonacci-like).
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n

    # dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
    # We only need to keep track of the last two values
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2  # ways for n=1 and n=2

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current

    return prev1

# Example usage
print(climb_stairs(2))  # Output: 2 (1+1, 2)
print(climb_stairs(5))  # Output: 8
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;

  // dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
  // We only need to keep track of the last two values
  let prev2 = 1; // ways for n=1
  let prev1 = 2; // ways for n=2

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    const current = prev1 + prev2;
    prev2 = prev1;
    prev1 = current;
  }
  return prev1;
}

// Example usage
console.log(climbStairs(2)); // 2
console.log(climbStairs(5)); // 8
```

```java
public class ClimbingStairs {
    public static int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;

        // dp[i] represents ways to reach step i
        // We only need to keep track of the last two values
        int prev2 = 1; // ways for n=1
        int prev1 = 2; // ways for n=2

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return prev1;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(climbStairs(2)); // 2
        System.out.println(climbStairs(5)); // 8
    }
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy

A focused 4-6 week plan is more effective than months of unstructured study. Here is a targeted approach.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Frequency.** Ignore company tags initially. Use the first week to solidify the top five topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting, DP). Solve 3-5 core problems per topic from a curated list of high-frequency LeetCode problems. In week two, shift to solving exclusively **Medium** difficulty problems across these topics. The goal is speed and recognition of patterns.

**Weeks 3-4: Targeted Visa Practice.** Now, apply your skills to actual Visa-tagged questions on platforms like TidyBit. Start with Easy and Medium problems to understand the company's style. In the fourth week, deliberately attempt the reported Hard problems. Even if you don't solve them immediately, analyzing the solution teaches you the level of optimization expected.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Revisit any problem patterns you found challenging. Dedicate significant time to **mock interviews**. Simulate the 45-minute session: 5 minutes for clarification, 30 minutes for coding and explanation, 10 minutes for Q&A. Practice verbalizing your thought process. In the final days, review key problem solutions but prioritize rest.

### Sample Week 1 Problem Set

To kickstart your foundation weeks, here are 3 core problems per topic (total 15 problems) to build pattern recognition:

- **Array:** Two Sum, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, Product of Array Except Self
- **String:** Valid Anagram, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Valid Parentheses
- **Hash Table:** Two Sum (again, for practice), Group Anagrams, First Unique Character in a String
- **Sorting:** Merge Intervals, Meeting Rooms II, Kth Largest Element in an Array
- **Dynamic Programming:** Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize From the Start.** For Visa, a brute-force solution followed by an optimized one is acceptable, but starting with an optimal approach is better. When you hear the problem, immediately consider the time/space complexity goal. Mention your complexity analysis aloud. For example, when presented with an array problem, ask yourself: "Can sorting help? Would a hash map provide O(1) lookups? Is there a two-pointer or sliding window approach?"

2.  **Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases.** Before coding, always ask: What is the input size? What is the data range? Are there negative numbers? Can the array be empty? This demonstrates thoroughness and prevents major logic errors. Write these down as you discuss them with the interviewer. For instance, for a string problem, clarify: "Should we consider case sensitivity? Are we dealing only with alphanumeric characters? What should we return for an empty string input?"

3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include consistent indentation, and write short, clear functions. Comment briefly on complex logic. Visa evaluates your code as if it were going into their codebase. Here's an example of poor vs. better variable naming:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Poor
def f(a, b):
    x = {}
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] not in x:
            x[a[i]] = 0
        x[a[i]] += 1
    # ... hard to follow logic

# Better
def find_anagram_indices(s, p):
    result_indices = []
    pattern_count = {}
    # Build frequency map for the pattern
    for char in p:
        pattern_count[char] = pattern_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    # ... clear logic
```

```javascript
// Poor
function q(arr, t) {
  let m = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // ... cryptic
  }
}

// Better
function findTwoSumIndices(numbers, targetSum) {
  const seenNumbers = new Map();
  for (let currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < numbers.length; currentIndex++) {
    const complement = targetSum - numbers[currentIndex];
    // ... clear intent
  }
}
```

```java
// Poor
public int[] sol(int[] a, int t) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        // ... unclear
    }
}

// Better
public int[] findTwoSumIndices(int[] numbers, int targetSum) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> valueToIndex = new HashMap<>();
    for (int currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < numbers.length; currentIndex++) {
        int complement = targetSum - numbers[currentIndex];
        // ... self-documenting
    }
}
```

</div>

4.  **Practice Under Time Pressure.** Set a hard 25-minute limit for solving Medium problems during your practice. This builds the mental stamina and focus needed for the real interview, where you must also explain your reasoning. Use a timer for every practice session. Break down the 25 minutes: 5 minutes for understanding and planning, 15 minutes for coding, and 5 minutes for testing and edge case review.

Success in Visa's coding interviews is a function of focused practice on their preferred topics and difficulty level. Build a strong foundation with the core patterns and code examples shown here, apply it to their specific problems, and simulate the interview environment until you're confident. Remember, consistency and targeted practice trump sheer volume.
