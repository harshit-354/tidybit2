Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm that appears in over 240 coding interview questions. Its recursive, stack-based nature makes it the intuitive choice for exploring graphs, trees, and complex state spaces. Mastering DFS isn't just about memorizing traversal code; it's about recognizing the patterns where its "go deep first" philosophy provides the clearest solution path.

## Common Patterns

Interview questions using DFS typically fit into a few recognizable molds. Identifying which pattern you're dealing with is the first step to a clean implementation.

### 1. Tree/Graph Traversal

This is the classic use case: visiting every node. For trees, you often need to collect information (like node values) in a specific order (pre-order, in-order, post-order). For graphs, the critical addition is a visited set to avoid cycles.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def dfs_tree(node, result):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order: Process node first
    result.append(node.val)
    dfs_tree(node.left, result)
    dfs_tree(node.right, result)

def dfs_graph(node, visited):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs_graph(neighbor, visited)
```

```javascript
function dfsTree(node, result) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order traversal
  result.push(node.val);
  dfsTree(node.left, result);
  dfsTree(node.right, result);
}

function dfsGraph(node, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  for (const neighbor of node.neighbors) {
    dfsGraph(neighbor, visited);
  }
}
```

```java
public void dfsTree(TreeNode node, List<Integer> result) {
    if (node == null) return;
    result.add(node.val); // Pre-order
    dfsTree(node.left, result);
    dfsTree(node.right, result);
}

public void dfsGraph(Node node, Set<Node> visited) {
    if (visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
        dfsGraph(neighbor, visited);
    }
}
```

</div>

### 2. Pathfinding and Backtracking

When the problem asks for _all_ possible paths, configurations, or combinations (e.g., "generate all parentheses," "find all paths in a grid"), you're in backtracking territory. DFS explores one choice to its end, then backtracks to try the next one. The state is modified before the recursive call and reverted after.

### 3. Connected Components

Problems involving islands, friend circles, or region counting are about finding connected components in a grid or graph. You perform a DFS from a starting point to mark an entire connected region as visited. The number of times you initiate a new DFS equals the number of components.

### 4. Cycle Detection and Topological Sort

For directed graphs, a modified DFS with a recursion stack (or "visiting" state) can detect cycles. Topological sort, essential for scheduling problems, is essentially a post-order DFS traversal of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), with nodes added to an order list after their dependencies are processed.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Of the 242 DFS questions, the split is: **Easy: 36 (15%), Medium: 143 (59%), Hard: 63 (26%)**.

This distribution is telling. Only 15% are straightforward traversals. The vast majority (85%) are Medium or Hard, meaning the core DFS algorithm is just the engine; the real challenge is framing the problem. A Medium question might layer in backtracking or careful state management on a well-defined graph. A Hard question often involves combining DFS with another concept (like dynamic programming for memoization), navigating a complex implicit state space, or requiring deep optimization to avoid timeouts. This split emphasizes that your goal is to learn to _apply_ DFS, not just implement it.

## Which Companies Ask Depth-First Search

DFS is a universal tool, so it's favored by companies testing strong algorithmic fundamentals.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently uses DFS for backtracking and complex graph problems.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) often ask tree/graph traversal and component problems in their early-round interviews.
- [Meta](/company/meta) leans heavily on DFS for tree serialization and recursive design in their coding screens.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) poses many grid-based DFS problems for financial data modeling.

## Study Tips

1.  **Implement Iterative and Recursive Versions.** Know how to use an explicit stack for iterative DFS. This is crucial for avoiding stack overflow on deep recursion and is sometimes explicitly required.
2.  **Draw the State.** Before coding, draw the tree/graph and the recursion path. For backtracking, sketch the decision tree. This visual step prevents logic errors and clarifies the state you need to pass.
3.  **Memorize the Backtracking Template.** The pattern of "choose, explore, unchoose" is repetitive. Internalize it so you can focus on the problem-specific logic.
4.  **Practice Implicit Graph Problems.** Many problems don't give you a Node class. The graph is implicit, like a 2D grid where each cell is a node connected to its four neighbors. Practice converting these problems into a standard DFS traversal.

Success with DFS questions comes from pattern recognition and precise implementation. Start with basic traversal, then systematically practice each pattern to build the instinct for when and how to apply this versatile algorithm.
