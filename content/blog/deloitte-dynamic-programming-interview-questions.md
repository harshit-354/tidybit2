Dynamic Programming (DP) is a core algorithmic technique tested in Deloitte's technical interviews because it directly evaluates a candidate's ability to break down complex, real-world problems into optimal, efficient solutions. In consulting and analytics, where Deloitte operates, professionals constantly face problems involving optimization, cost minimization, and resource allocation—whether it's streamlining a supply chain, optimizing a financial model, or scheduling projects. DP's methodology of solving overlapping subproblems and storing their results mirrors the need to build on prior analysis to avoid redundant work, a critical skill for delivering efficient client solutions. Mastering DP demonstrates structured problem-solving and computational efficiency, key traits for roles in technology consulting, data engineering, and analytics at Deloitte.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Deloitte's DP questions typically focus on practical, medium-difficulty patterns rather than obscure theoretical puzzles. You can expect problems that test foundational DP concepts applicable to business scenarios. Common types include:

- **Knapsack Problems:** Modeling resource allocation with constraints, like selecting projects within a budget to maximize value.
- **String/Sequence Problems:** Involves operations like edit distance (relevant for data cleansing) or longest common subsequence (for comparing datasets).
- **Grid/Path Problems:** Finding minimum or maximum cost paths in a matrix, analogous to optimizing routes or workflows.
- **1D/2D DP on Arrays:** Problems like house robber (maximum sum with constraints) or coin change (minimum coins for an amount), which model financial or combinatorial optimization.

The problems are designed to assess your ability to identify the DP state, recurrence relation, and implement an efficient solution, often with a focus on time and space complexity.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by solidifying the core principle: DP is used for problems with **optimal substructure** (an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems) and **overlapping subproblems**. Memorizing solutions is ineffective; instead, practice deriving the recurrence relation. Follow this process: 1) Define what `dp[i]` represents, 2) Establish the base case(s), 3) Write the recurrence relation that builds `dp[i]` from previous states, 4) Determine the iteration order, and 5) Extract the final answer.

A fundamental pattern is the **Fibonacci sequence**, which is the simplest example of overlapping subproblems. The naive recursive solution has exponential time complexity, but DP reduces it to linear time by storing results.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]  # Recurrence relation
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Recurrence relation
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]; // Recurrence relation
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Build your skills progressively. Do not jump to hard problems immediately.

1.  **Foundation:** Start with classic 1D DP: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber.
2.  **Key Patterns:** Move to 0/1 Knapsack and Unbounded Knapsack (Coin Change). These are highly relevant.
3.  **2D DP:** Practice Longest Common Subsequence and Minimum Path Sum in a grid.
4.  **Deloitte-Specific:** Finally, focus on problems tagged for Deloitte on platforms like TidyBit, which will reflect their exact question style and difficulty.

Consistent, conceptual practice is more valuable than cramming. Aim to solve 1-2 DP problems daily in the weeks leading to your interview.
