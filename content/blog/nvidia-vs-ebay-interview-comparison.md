When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. Both NVIDIA and eBay conduct rigorous coding interviews, but their approaches differ significantly in volume and emphasis. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you strategize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

NVIDIA's interview process is notably more intensive, with a catalog of 137 documented questions compared to eBay's 60. This larger volume suggests a broader potential question pool and a more demanding interview loop.

The difficulty distribution reveals their screening priorities:

- **NVIDIA (E34/M89/H14)**: Places heavy emphasis on **Medium** difficulty questions, which comprise nearly 65% of their question bank. This indicates they prioritize strong, consistent problem-solving on standard algorithmic challenges over either trivial exercises or extreme optimization puzzles. The substantial number of Easy questions (34) suggests they may use simpler problems for initial screening or phone interviews.
- **eBay (E12/M38/H10)**: Also focuses on Medium problems, which make up about 63% of their questions. However, their overall lower volume across all difficulties, especially Easy (12 vs. NVIDIA's 34), implies a slightly more streamlined or focused interview process.

Both companies have a similar proportion of Hard questions (roughly 10-11% of their total), meaning you cannot neglect advanced problems for either.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies concentrate on the same four core data structure and algorithm topics: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting**. This strong overlap means a unified study plan for these areas can efficiently serve interviews at both firms.

**Array and String** problems often involve two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, or matrix traversal. **Hash Table** is frequently the key to achieving optimal time complexity for lookups and counting. **Sorting** is both a direct topic and a common preprocessing step.

Given the shared focus, mastering these topics is non-negotiable. You can expect problems like:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The main difference lies in NVIDIA's larger question bank, which likely contains more variations and deeper explorations within these shared topics. You might encounter more complex array manipulations or intricate string matching problems at NVIDIA simply due to the greater number of questions they pull from.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **eBay first**. Its smaller, more focused question bank (60 questions) allows you to build a solid foundation in the core shared topics efficiently. Achieving coverage and proficiency here is a faster milestone.

Once comfortable with eBay's pattern, transition to **NVIDIA** preparation. This becomes an exercise in scaling up: you are reinforcing the same four core topics but must practice a wider variety of problems and edge cases due to the larger pool. The jump from 60 to 137 questions is significant, but the underlying skills are identical. NVIDIA's higher number of Easy questions also suggests you should ensure flawless execution on fundamental problems—a skill that transfers perfectly.

In short, use eBay's profile to build core competency efficiently, then use NVIDIA's to stress-test and expand your depth within the same algorithmic areas.
