IMC’s coding interviews are known for being intensely practical. They focus on algorithmic problem-solving under time pressure, often with a strong emphasis on optimization, clean implementation, and sometimes low-level systems thinking. The process typically involves one or more technical rounds where you’ll be asked to solve 1-2 problems on a shared editor, followed by discussions on approach, trade-offs, and edge cases.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, the difficulty distribution of IMC’s coding questions is revealing: **0% Easy, 71% Medium, 29% Hard**. This breakdown tells you exactly what to expect: no warm-up questions. You are expected to be fully prepared from the first minute.

The high concentration of Medium problems means you must have core data structures and algorithms at your fingertips—you can’t afford to hesitate on fundamentals. The significant Hard portion (nearly 1 in 3 questions) indicates they are testing for depth. These problems often involve combining multiple concepts (e.g., binary search on a matrix) or require an optimized solution beyond the first brute-force idea. The takeaway is clear: your preparation must be thorough enough to handle Medium problems with high speed and accuracy, while also being prepared to tackle complex, multi-step Hard problems under interview conditions.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are your blueprint for study. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, prefix sums, or two-pointer techniques. You must write bug-free, efficient array code.
- **Stack:** Critical for problems involving matching pairs, next greater/smaller elements, and parsing. The pattern of using a stack to maintain a monotonic sequence is key.
- **Binary Search:** Not just for simple sorted arrays. IMC often uses it in advanced contexts like searching in a sorted matrix, finding the optimal value in a solution space (min-max problems), or with custom predicate functions.
- **Matrix:** Problems involve traversal (spiral, diagonal), search (sorted matrix), or dynamic programming on grids. Fluency in navigating 2D indices is essential.
- **Design:** This can range from designing a class with specific methods (like a data structure) to broader system design concepts. Focus on clear APIs, state management, and time/space trade-offs.

The most important pattern to master is **Binary Search on a Sorted Matrix**. It combines two of IMC's top topics into a classic Hard problem pattern.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def search_matrix(matrix, target):
    """
    Searches a 2D matrix where each row is sorted left-to-right
    and each column is sorted top-to-bottom.
    """
    if not matrix:
        return False

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    # Start from the top-right corner
    row, col = 0, cols - 1

    while row < rows and col >= 0:
        current = matrix[row][col]
        if current == target:
            return True
        elif current > target:
            # Target is smaller, move left
            col -= 1
        else:
            # Target is larger, move down
            row += 1
    return False
```

```javascript
function searchMatrix(matrix, target) {
  /**
   * Searches a 2D matrix where each row is sorted left-to-right
   * and each column is sorted top-to-bottom.
   */
  if (!matrix || matrix.length === 0) return false;

  const rows = matrix.length;
  const cols = matrix[0].length;
  // Start from the top-right corner
  let row = 0;
  let col = cols - 1;

  while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
    const current = matrix[row][col];
    if (current === target) {
      return true;
    } else if (current > target) {
      // Target is smaller, move left
      col--;
    } else {
      // Target is larger, move down
      row++;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

```java
public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
    /**
     * Searches a 2D matrix where each row is sorted left-to-right
     * and each column is sorted top-to-bottom.
     */
    if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0) return false;

    int rows = matrix.length;
    int cols = matrix[0].length;
    // Start from the top-right corner
    int row = 0;
    int col = cols - 1;

    while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
        int current = matrix[row][col];
        if (current == target) {
            return true;
        } else if (current > target) {
            // Target is smaller, move left
            col--;
        } else {
            // Target is larger, move down
            row++;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is critical given the difficulty level.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Foundation**

- Focus intensely on the top five topics: Array, Stack, Binary Search, Matrix, Design.
- For each topic, solve 15-20 curated Medium problems. Prioritize problems that teach the core pattern (e.g., monotonic stack for Stack, search space reduction for Binary Search).
- Goal: Achieve the ability to identify the pattern and implement a working solution for any Medium problem in these topics within 25 minutes.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Speed**

- Move to Hard problems within the top topics, especially those combining them (e.g., "Binary Search in a Sorted Matrix").
- Practice under timed conditions. Use a timer for every problem.
- Begin doing mock interviews focusing on 2 problems in 45-50 minutes to simulate IMC's pace.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Simulation**

- Solve complete sets of 2-3 problems back-to-back without breaks.
- Focus on clean, production-quality code from the start. Comment on time/space complexity verbally or in writing.
- Review all mistakes meticulously. For every error, identify the root cause (misunderstood pattern, off-by-one error, missed edge case) and drill that weakness.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize From the Start:** IMC values efficient solutions. Always state the brute-force approach, but immediately follow up with the optimized plan. Think about time and space complexity aloud.
2.  **Handle Edge Cases Proactively:** Before you start coding, verbally confirm edge cases with your interviewer (empty input, single element, large values). Write these down and ensure your code handles them.
3.  **Practice Verbalizing Your Thought Process:** Don't code in silence. Explain your reasoning, why you chose a data structure, and what trade-offs you're making. This is as important as the code itself.
4.  **Write Clean, Compilable Code First:** Aim to write code that would run on the first try. Use clear variable names, avoid overly clever one-liners, and structure your code logically. This demonstrates professionalism and reduces debugging time.
5.  **Know Your Fundamentals Cold:** Be prepared to discuss the "constant factors" or lower-level implications of your solution, especially for array and matrix problems (cache locality, memory access patterns).

Success in an IMC interview comes from precise, efficient, and well-communicated problem-solving. Structure your preparation around their proven patterns, and practice until both speed and accuracy are automatic.
