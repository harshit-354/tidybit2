When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Snapchat (Snap) and JPMorgan Chase represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a pure-play social media tech giant, and the other is a financial institution with a heavy technology focus. Their publicly available question breakdowns reveal clear differences in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis, which should guide your study strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell a significant story. Snapchat's list comprises **99 questions**, categorized as 99 Easy, 62 Medium, and 31 Hard. This indicates a substantial emphasis on medium and hard problems, with Hard questions making up nearly a third of the total. The high volume and difficulty skew suggest Snapchat's process is designed to rigorously assess algorithmic problem-solving under pressure, typical of top-tier tech companies.

In contrast, JPMorgan's list has **78 questions**, with a very different distribution: 25 Easy, 45 Medium, and only 8 Hard. The difficulty curve is far more moderate, with a strong focus on Medium problems and a minimal number of Hard ones. This reflects an interview process that still tests core programming competency but may place greater relative weight on system design, financial knowledge, behavioral fit, or domain-specific problems compared to relentless algorithmic grinding.

```python
# Example of a classic "Medium" difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
# Relevant to both companies' top topics.
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        key = ''.join(sorted(s))
        anagram_map[key].append(s)
    return list(anagram_map.values())
```

```javascript
// Example of a classic "Medium" difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const s of strs) {
    const key = s.split("").sort().join("");
    if (!map.has(key)) map.set(key, []);
    map.get(key).push(s);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

```java
// Example of a classic "Medium" difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            String key = new String(chars);
            map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(key).add(s);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong focus on fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** are top topics for both, forming a crucial common core. These are the building blocks for most interview questions.

The key differentiator lies in the next layer of topics. Snapchat explicitly lists **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, which is often critical for graph and tree traversal problems common in Hard questions (e.g., shortest path in a grid, level-order traversal). This aligns with their higher proportion of difficult problems.

JPMorgan lists **Sorting** as a primary topic. While sorting is a fundamental concept, its explicit prominence suggests a possible emphasis on problems involving data organization, merging intervals, or optimizing operations on datasets—skills highly relevant in financial data processing. The absence of advanced graph algorithms like BFS from their top list correlates with their fewer Hard questions.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and timeline.

**Start with JPMorgan if:** You are new to technical interviews or are applying for roles where strong algorithmic skills are one of several important criteria. The focus on Medium-difficulty problems on core data structures (Array, String, Hash Table) provides an excellent and manageable foundation. Mastering these will build your confidence and cover a significant portion of what's tested. You can then tackle their limited set of Hard questions.

**Start with Snapchat if:** You are aiming for a software engineering role at a top tech firm and need to ramp up intensity. The broad set of 99 questions, with its heavy weighting towards Medium and Hard, will force you to grapple with more complex problem-solving and algorithms like BFS early on. Successfully preparing for Snapchat's list will inherently cover virtually all of JPMorgan's technical scope, making it efficient if you have the time and foundational skill.

A pragmatic hybrid approach is to first solidify the **common core** (Array, String, Hash Table problems at Easy/Medium level), then branch based on your target. This ensures you are prepared for the overlapping majority of questions from both companies.
