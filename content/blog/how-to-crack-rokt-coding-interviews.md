Rokt’s technical interviews are designed to assess strong foundational coding skills and the ability to think through complex, scalable problems. The process typically involves one or two coding rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted in a collaborative IDE. Success hinges on a clear, efficient approach and clean code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, the question difficulty distribution is a balanced split: 33% Easy, 33% Medium, and 33% Hard. This breakdown is critical for strategy. The presence of Hard problems means you cannot rely solely on mastering basics; you must be prepared for multi-step optimization and advanced data structure manipulation. However, the equal weighting of Easy and Medium questions indicates that securing these points is non-negotiable. A candidate who flawlessly solves the two Easy and two Medium problems but makes solid progress on one Hard problem is in a very strong position. This distribution rewards consistent, error-free execution across fundamental topics before challenging depth.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are String, Stack, Math, Recursion, and Array. Mastery here covers the vast majority of problems you'll see.

- **String:** Often combined with two-pointer or sliding window techniques for palindrome, substring, or anagram problems. A key pattern is the **two-pointer for in-place manipulation**.
- **Stack:** Essential for parsing, validation (parentheses), and monotonic stack problems for next-greater-element patterns. The classic pattern is **using a stack to track open brackets or maintain monotonic order**.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation. A common pattern is **using modulo and division to reverse integers or extract digits**.
- **Recursion:** Frequently appears in tree/graph traversal, backtracking (permutations), and divide-and-conquer. The core pattern is **defining a base case and a recurrence relation**.
- **Array:** The foundation for most algorithms. Crucial patterns include **prefix sum, two-pointer, and binary search on transformed arrays**.

The most critical cross-topic pattern is the **Stack for validation and reversal**, as it's fundamental to both String and parsing problems. Here is a classic example: Valid Parentheses.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:  # Closing bracket
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:  # Opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const mapping = { ")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "[" };

  for (let char of s) {
    if (mapping[char]) {
      // Closing bracket
      const top = stack.length ? stack.pop() : "#";
      if (mapping[char] !== top) {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      // Opening bracket
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Character, Character> mapping = Map.of(')', '(', '}', '{', ']', '[');

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (mapping.containsKey(c)) { // Closing bracket
            char top = stack.isEmpty() ? '#' : stack.pop();
            if (mapping.get(c) != top) {
                return false;
            }
        } else { // Opening bracket
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is essential to cover the breadth and depth required.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate blocks of 2-3 days to each of the top five topics (String, Array, Stack, Recursion, Math). For each, solve 10-15 problems spanning Easy to Medium difficulty. Focus on internalizing the key patterns mentioned above. Use a platform that tracks your progress.
- **Week 3: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery.** Start mixing topics. Focus exclusively on Medium-difficulty problems that combine patterns, like a String problem using a Stack or Recursion on Arrays. Aim for 2-3 problems per day with deep analysis of time/space complexity.
- **Week 4: Hard Problems & Mock Interviews.** Allocate time to tackle Hard problems, especially in String and Array manipulation. Don't aim to solve every one perfectly; focus on developing a step-by-step approach (brute force -> optimization). Conduct 2-3 timed mock interviews simulating the Rokt format.
- **Weeks 5-6 (if available): Review & Weakness Attack.** Revisit all previously solved problems, especially those you struggled with. Redo them without looking at the solution. Perform more mocks to build stamina and communication skills under pressure.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process First.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, including a brute-force solution and potential optimizations. This demonstrates structured thinking even if you don't reach the optimal code immediately.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** For Easy and Medium problems, a clear, correct, and reasonably efficient solution is better than a buggy, optimal one. Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Explicitly run through examples, including empty inputs, single elements, large values, and sorted/reversed data. State these cases aloud as you test your logic.
4.  **Know Your Time Complexities.** Be prepared to state and justify the Big O of your solution for both time and space. This is a fundamental part of the evaluation.
5.  **Practice in the Company's Preferred Environment.** If possible, find out which IDE or platform Rokt uses (e.g., CoderPad, HackerRank) and practice in a similar environment to avoid day-of friction.

Mastering these topics and executing this strategy will systematically prepare you for the balanced challenge of a Rokt interview.
