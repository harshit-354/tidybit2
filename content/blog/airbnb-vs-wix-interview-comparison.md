When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. Airbnb and Wix, while both being prominent tech companies, show distinct differences in their question banks on TidyBit. Understanding these differences can help you allocate your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Airbnb's question bank consists of **64 questions**, categorized as Easy (11), Medium (34), and Hard (19). This distribution indicates a significant emphasis on Medium and Hard problems, suggesting their interviews are designed to test robust problem-solving skills and algorithmic depth. The high proportion of Hard questions (nearly 30%) is notable and implies you should be comfortable with complex scenarios and optimized solutions.

Wix's question bank is slightly smaller at **56 questions**, with a breakdown of Easy (16), Medium (31), and Hard (9). The difficulty distribution here is more skewed towards Medium problems, with a smaller tail of Hard questions. This suggests Wix's interviews may focus more on core competency and reliable implementation under standard constraints, though advanced topics are still assessed.

**Key Takeaway:** Airbnb's interview appears more demanding in terms of algorithmic rigor, while Wix's seems to prioritize a strong grasp of fundamentals with some advanced topics.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** operations. These are foundational data structures for handling and manipulating data, a common requirement in web development and platform engineering.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Using Hash Table for a frequency count (common to both)
def count_elements(arr):
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    return freq
```

```javascript
// Example: Using Hash Table for a frequency count (common to both)
function countElements(arr) {
  const freq = {};
  for (const num of arr) {
    freq[num] = (freq[num] || 0) + 1;
  }
  return freq;
}
```

```java
// Example: Using Hash Table for a frequency count (common to both)
import java.util.HashMap;

public Map<Integer, Integer> countElements(int[] arr) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : arr) {
        freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freq;
}
```

</div>

The primary divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Airbnb lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with their higher number of Hard questions, as DP problems often require advanced pattern recognition and state optimization.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP pattern (Airbnb-relevant): Fibonacci
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP pattern (Airbnb-relevant): Fibonacci
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP pattern (Airbnb-relevant): Fibonacci
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public int fib(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
    if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
    if (n <= 2) return 1;
    int result = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    memo.put(n, result);
    return result;
}
```

</div>

Wix lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This indicates a focus on graph and tree traversal problems, which are common in scenarios involving hierarchical data, UI component trees, or navigation systems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DFS on a graph (Wix-relevant)
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS on a graph (Wix-relevant)
function dfs(graph, node, visited = new Set()) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
  }
}
```

```java
// Example DFS on a graph (Wix-relevant)
import java.util.*;

public void dfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int node, Set<Integer> visited) {
    if (visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
    }
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target company and timeline.

If you are interviewing with **Airbnb**, you must prioritize **Dynamic Programming**. Practice common DP patterns (0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.) and ensure you can handle their high frequency of Medium and Hard problems. Solidify your core skills with Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings first, then dedicate significant time to DP.

If **Wix** is your target, ensure you are proficient in **graph and tree traversals** using DFS and BFS. While their question set has fewer Hard problems, mastery of DFS is crucial. Strengthen your foundational skills with the three overlapping topics (Array, String, Hash Table) as they form the bulk of the questions.

For a generalist preparing for both or similar companies, **start with the shared foundation**. Achieve fluency in manipulating arrays, strings, and hash maps. Once that is solid, branch out based on your interview schedule: study DP for Airbnb-like interviews and DFS for Wix-like interviews. The overlapping core will serve you for either company.
