Wix’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and clean code. The process typically involves 1-2 technical rounds focusing on problem-solving, often with a mix of algorithmic challenges and system design or practical web development scenarios. Success hinges on methodical preparation targeting their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 56 Wix coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 16 Easy (29%), 31 Medium (55%), and 9 Hard (16%). This breakdown is critical for your strategy. The overwhelming majority (84%) of questions are at the Easy or Medium level. This indicates Wix prioritizes consistent, robust solutions over esoteric optimization. Your goal is not to solve the hardest problems flawlessly, but to demonstrate flawless execution on the core Medium-level questions that form the backbone of their interview. The Hard questions often appear in later rounds or for senior roles, testing depth on complex graph or dynamic programming concepts.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows five dominant topics. Master these to cover a significant portion of the question pool.

- **Array (Frequency: High):** The most common structure. Expect questions on in-place manipulation, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
- **String (Frequency: High):** Often tested alongside Arrays. Focus on palindrome checks, anagram comparisons, and substring searches.
- **Hash Table (Frequency: High):** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, pair matching, or duplicate detection.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) (Frequency: Medium):** A key graph/tree traversal method. Crucial for problems involving paths, connected components, or tree property validation.
- **Math (Frequency: Medium):** Tests logical reasoning. Problems often involve number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation.

For the top topic, **Array**, the **Sliding Window** pattern is fundamental for subarray/substring problems. Here is a template for finding the longest substring with at most K distinct characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Follow this plan, adjusting for your starting level.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Drill **Array** and **String** problems. Implement all major patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sum.
- Days 8-14: Master **Hash Table** applications and basic **Math** problems. Solve 3-5 problems daily, focusing on understanding, not just solving.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Practice**

- Days 15-21: Tackle **Depth-First Search (DFS)** on trees and graphs. Practice recursion and iterative implementations.
- Days 22-28: Introduce **Dynamic Programming** and revisit **Hard** array/string problems. Start doing timed 60-minute sessions.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gap Analysis**

- Schedule at least 5-7 mock interviews simulating the Wix format. Use platforms or a study partner.
- Identify weak topics from your practice log and dedicate full days to review them. In the final 3 days, solve only Medium problems to build confidence and speed.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code:** Verbally outline your approach, discuss trade-offs (time vs. space complexity), and mention edge cases. This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use clear variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases (empty input, large values) explicitly. Wix values clean, maintainable code.
3.  **Optimize Iteratively:** First, present a brute-force solution. Then, logically optimize it. This shows your problem-solving process, even if you don't recall the optimal pattern immediately.
4.  **Test Your Own Code:** After writing, walk through a small test case with your code. Verbally check for off-by-one errors and logic flaws. This proves you can self-correct.

Target the Medium-difficulty core of Array, String, and Hash Table problems with disciplined practice. Consistent, clear communication paired with robust code will get you through.
