Zalando’s technical interview process for software engineering roles is a structured assessment of your problem-solving and coding skills. Typically, you’ll face one or two rounds of live coding interviews, conducted via platforms like Codility or HackerRank, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving. The goal is to evaluate not just if you get the correct answer, but how you think, communicate, and write clean, efficient code under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Zalando’s coding questions are distributed as follows: 25% Easy, 75% Medium, and 0% Hard. This breakdown is crucial for your preparation strategy.

The absence of Hard problems means you can focus your energy on mastering fundamentals and common patterns rather than esoteric, complex algorithms. However, the 75% Medium weighting is significant. A Medium problem at Zalando often involves combining two or three core concepts (like iterating through an array while using a hash map for lookups) or applying a standard algorithm (like Greedy or Sorting) to a slightly novel scenario. Success hinges on reliably solving these Medium problems within the interview timeframe with optimal or near-optimal solutions. The single Easy question is typically a warm-up but must be solved flawlessly and efficiently to build confidence.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Greedy, Array, String, and Sorting. You should prioritize these.

- **Greedy:** Problems where a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution. Common in scheduling, partitioning, or "minimum/maximum" problems.
- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Questions test manipulation, traversal, and applying algorithms like two-pointer or prefix sum.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems, focusing on parsing, comparison, and transformation, sometimes using character frequency maps.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just "sort this." It's usually a prerequisite step that enables a simpler, efficient main algorithm (like two-pointer or Greedy) to work.

The most important pattern to master is the **Greedy approach applied to sorted data**. This combination appears frequently. The pattern is: 1) Sort the input array based on a specific criterion (start time, end time, value, etc.). 2) Iterate through the sorted data, making a greedy decision at each step, often using a simple variable to track the "current best" state.

```python
def find_minimum_meeting_rooms(intervals):
    """
    A classic Greedy + Sorting problem.
    Returns the minimum number of meeting rooms required.
    """
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    # Separate sorted start and end times
    start_times = sorted(i[0] for i in intervals)
    end_times = sorted(i[1] for i in intervals)

    start_ptr = end_ptr = 0
    used_rooms = 0

    # Greedy traversal: allocate a new room only if a meeting starts before the earliest ending meeting ends.
    while start_ptr < len(intervals):
        if start_times[start_ptr] >= end_times[end_ptr]:
            # A room is freed up
            used_rooms -= 1
            end_ptr += 1
        # A new meeting starts, need a room
        used_rooms += 1
        start_ptr += 1

    return used_rooms

# Example
intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(find_minimum_meeting_rooms(intervals))  # Output: 2
```

```javascript
function findMinimumMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return 0;

  const startTimes = intervals.map((i) => i[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const endTimes = intervals.map((i) => i[1]).sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let startPtr = 0,
    endPtr = 0;
  let usedRooms = 0;

  while (startPtr < intervals.length) {
    if (startTimes[startPtr] >= endTimes[endPtr]) {
      usedRooms--;
      endPtr++;
    }
    usedRooms++;
    startPtr++;
  }
  return usedRooms;
}

// Example
const intervals = [
  [0, 30],
  [5, 10],
  [15, 20],
];
console.log(findMinimumMeetingRooms(intervals)); // Output: 2
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int findMinimumMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;

        int[] startTimes = new int[intervals.length];
        int[] endTimes = new int[intervals.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            startTimes[i] = intervals[i][0];
            endTimes[i] = intervals[i][1];
        }
        Arrays.sort(startTimes);
        Arrays.sort(endTimes);

        int startPtr = 0, endPtr = 0;
        int usedRooms = 0;

        while (startPtr < intervals.length) {
            if (startTimes[startPtr] >= endTimes[endPtr]) {
                usedRooms--;
                endPtr++;
            }
            usedRooms++;
            startPtr++;
        }
        return usedRooms;
    }

    // Example usage
    // public static void main(String[] args) {
    //     int[][] intervals = {{0, 30}, {5, 10}, {15, 20}};
    //     System.out.println(new Solution().findMinimumMeetingRooms(intervals)); // Output: 2
    // }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this time to the top four topics. For each topic (Greedy, Array, String, Sorting), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern. Use a platform that categorizes problems by topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed.** Stop solving by topic. Start doing mixed problem sets of Medium difficulty, simulating a 45-minute interview session. This trains you to identify which pattern to apply from an unsorted list. Practice explaining your thought process out loud as you solve.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Company-Specific Practice.** In the final stretch, conduct at least 3-5 full mock interviews with a peer or mentor. Spend significant time solving problems specifically tagged for Zalando. This acclimates you to their problem style and difficulty level. Revisit and re-solve any problems you struggled with in the first four weeks.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write a single line of code, restate the problem in your own words, ask clarifying questions, and verbally outline your approach, including time/space complexity. Interviewers assess your collaboration skills.
2.  **Prioritize a Working Solution.** Your first goal is always a correct, brute-force solution. Once you have it, and only then, analyze its bottlenecks and optimize. A partial optimal solution is worse than a complete brute-force one.
3.  **Test Your Code.** After writing your solution, don't just say "I'm done." Walk through a small test case with edge inputs (empty array, single element, large values) using your code. This catches logical errors and demonstrates thoroughness.
4.  **Know Your Language's Standard Library.** Be fluent in the essential utilities for your chosen language: sorting, heap/priority queue, hash map initialization and methods. Wasting time looking up syntax creates a poor impression.

Mastering Medium problems on Greedy, Array, String, and Sorting through consistent, timed practice is the most direct path to success in a Zalando coding interview.
