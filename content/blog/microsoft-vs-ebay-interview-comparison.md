When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question banks provide targeted practice but vary dramatically in scale and focus. Microsoft and eBay represent two ends of this spectrum—one with a massive, well-documented history of problems, and the other with a smaller, more concentrated set. Understanding the differences in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is sheer volume. Microsoft's listed **1,352 questions** dwarf eBay's **60**. This reflects Microsoft's longer history of large-scale technical recruiting, its vast number of engineering roles, and its deeply ingrained culture of algorithmic interviewing, particularly for its core product and platform teams.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium (M762), with a significant number of Easy and a substantial pool of Hard problems. This spread indicates a comprehensive interview process that tests fundamental coding fluency, problem-solving, and advanced algorithmic mastery, often within a single interview loop.
- **eBay (E12/M38/H10):** The distribution is proportionally similar but on a much smaller scale. Medium-difficulty questions also form the core (38 out of 60), with fewer Easy and Hard problems. This suggests eBay's technical interviews are focused on strong, practical problem-solving skills, with less emphasis on extreme algorithmic optimization compared to top-tier tech giants.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational computer science concepts. The core topics—**Array, String, Hash Table**—are identical and top-ranked for both. This is universal; mastery of these data structures is non-negotiable for any software engineering interview.

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

The key divergence is in secondary topics. Microsoft's list includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a major category, a classic indicator of interviews that probe deep algorithmic thinking for roles in core systems, cloud, or backend services. eBay's list highlights **Sorting**, which often relates to practical data manipulation problems common in e-commerce contexts (e.g., sorting products, transactions, or search results). While DP may appear at eBay and sorting at Microsoft, their prominence in the listed topics signals a subtle difference in focus.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and timeline.

**Prepare for eBay first if:** You are interviewing soon or are earlier in your coding interview journey. The smaller, focused question bank is less overwhelming. Achieving deep mastery of the ~60 questions, especially the Medium ones, and the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) can provide a solid foundation for the interview. This focused practice is highly efficient.

**Prepare for Microsoft first if:** Microsoft is your primary target, or you are building a broad, foundational skill set for the FAANG-tier interview circuit. The vast question bank is a double-edged sword: it's an unparalleled resource for pattern recognition but can be paralyzing if approached aimlessly. Use it strategically by focusing on the highest-frequency questions within each core topic and difficulty band. The practice you gain here will inherently cover the core concepts needed for eBay and many other companies.

Ultimately, a strong candidate will be well-prepared for both. The core skills are transferable. Start with the company that aligns with your immediate goal or offers the most efficient path to building those universal skills.
