Deloitte’s coding interviews assess foundational problem-solving skills and clean code implementation. While not as algorithmically intense as some FAANG companies, they require consistent accuracy and clarity. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often with a business context. Success hinges on methodical preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing a dataset of 38 Deloitte coding questions reveals a clear focus on core competencies:

- **Easy: 15 (39%)**
- **Medium: 20 (53%)**
- **Hard: 3 (8%)**

This distribution is strategic. The majority (92%) of problems are Easy or Medium, signaling that interviewers prioritize **reliable, bug-free solutions over esoteric optimization**. The high Medium percentage indicates you must be comfortable with common patterns and combining 2-3 concepts (e.g., using a hash table to optimize an array traversal). The few Hard problems test depth under pressure, but a solid performance on fundamentals is the primary gate.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should be highly targeted. The top five topics, which will cover the vast majority of problems, are:

1.  **Array:** Master traversal, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums. Essential for any data manipulation task.
2.  **String:** Focus on palindrome checks, anagram comparisons, and substring searches. Often combined with hash tables.
3.  **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). Use it for frequency counting and duplicate detection.
4.  **Dynamic Programming:** Crucial for optimization problems (e.g., "maximum sum," "minimum path"). Start with the Fibonacci pattern and 0/1 knapsack.
5.  **Sorting:** Understand built-in sorts and when to apply custom comparators. Sorting is frequently a pre-processing step to enable other algorithms.

The most critical pattern across these topics is using a **Hash Table (or Dictionary) to track element frequencies**, which solves a huge class of Array and String problems. Here is a classic example: finding two numbers in an array that sum to a specific target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // No solution found
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Follow this weekly plan.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one core data structure: Array, String, Linked List, Tree, Graph, Hash Table, Heap, Stack/Queue. For each, learn the core operations and solve 3-5 Easy problems.
- **Week 3: Core Algorithms.** Focus on key algorithms: Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and basic Recursion/Backtracking. Solve 2-3 Medium problems for each pattern.
- **Week 4: Advanced Patterns.** Tackle Dynamic Programming and advanced Tree/Graph traversal (BFS/DFS). Start with canonical DP problems like climbing stairs and coin change. Solve 1-2 Hard problems to stretch your thinking.
- **Week 5: Company-Specific Practice.** Solve all available Deloitte-tagged problems. Time yourself to simulate interview conditions. Focus on articulating your thought process aloud.
- **Week 6: Mock Interviews & Review.** Conduct at least 3-4 mock interviews with a peer or mentor. Revisit all problems you got wrong. Solidify your understanding of time/space complexity analysis.

## Key Tips

1.  **Clarify Before Coding.** Deloitte problems may have business constraints. Ask clarifying questions about input boundaries, edge cases, and output format before writing a single line of code.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one with bugs. State the brute-force approach, then optimize. Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Explicitly walk through your code with a small example, then test with empty input, single-element input, large values, and negative numbers. This demonstrates thoroughness.
4.  **Communicate Continuously.** Explain your thought process, why you chose a data structure, and the trade-offs of your approach. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving journey, not just the final answer.
5.  **Know Your Basics.** Be prepared to explain the real-world time/space complexity of your solution and how you might scale it. Understand the fundamentals of your chosen programming language.

Mastering these patterns and executing this disciplined strategy will build the muscle memory needed to succeed. Consistency is your greatest ally.
