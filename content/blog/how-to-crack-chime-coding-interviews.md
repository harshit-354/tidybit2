Chime’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills relevant to building their financial platform. Candidates typically face a series of live coding interviews focusing on algorithmic challenges, often conducted via platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication, reflecting the need for engineers who can build reliable, scalable systems for banking services.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear pattern: Chime’s coding interviews are dominated by **Medium** difficulty problems (100% in our sample). There are no Easy or Hard problems represented. This tells you exactly what to expect: you will not be wasting time on trivial array manipulations, nor will you be expected to solve esoteric, research-level graph algorithms under pressure. The interview is a test of core competency—can you reliably and efficiently solve the kind of problems that form the daily bread-and-butter of backend and platform engineering? You need to be consistently solid on fundamental data structures and algorithms applied in practical contexts.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are **Array, Math, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Graph Theory**. These often intersect; for example, a grid (2D array) problem frequently requires DFS/BFS for traversal.

- **Array:** Master in-place operations, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques. These are foundational for efficient data processing.
- **Math:** Focus on modular arithmetic, number properties, and geometric calculations that can appear in financial or coordinate-based contexts.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) & Breadth-First Search (BFS):** These are your primary tools for traversing graphs, trees, and grids. Know recursive and iterative implementations, and when to use stack (DFS) vs. queue (BFS) logic.
- **Graph Theory:** Understand adjacency list representations, cycle detection, and shortest path algorithms (like BFS for unweighted graphs). Many real-world system relationships are modeled as graphs.

A critical pattern that combines **Array, Graph Theory, and BFS/DFS** is **grid traversal**. A common Medium problem is counting islands or finding the shortest path in a 2D matrix, which is a direct application of these concepts.

```python
from collections import deque

def num_islands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0

    def bfs(r, c):
        queue = deque([(r, c)])
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark as visited
        directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]

        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == '1':
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
                    grid[nr][nc] = '0'

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                bfs(r, c)
                count += 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function numIslands(grid) {
  if (!grid || grid.length === 0) return 0;

  const rows = grid.length;
  const cols = grid[0].length;
  let count = 0;
  const directions = [
    [1, 0],
    [-1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
  ];

  const bfs = (r, c) => {
    const queue = [[r, c]];
    grid[r][c] = "0";

    while (queue.length > 0) {
      const [row, col] = queue.shift();
      for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
        const nr = row + dr;
        const nc = col + dc;
        if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && grid[nr][nc] === "1") {
          queue.push([nr, nc]);
          grid[nr][nc] = "0";
        }
      }
    }
  };

  for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
      if (grid[r][c] === "1") {
        bfs(r, c);
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;

```

```java

public class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;

        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        int[][] directions = {{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    bfs(grid, r, c, rows, cols, directions);
                    count++;

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Systematically review core data structures: Arrays, Hash Maps, Stacks, Queues, Graphs (adjacency list), and Trees. Practice implementing BFS and DFS from scratch on LeetCode Easy/Medium problems tagged with these topics.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Deep Dive.** Dedicate blocks of 2-3 days to each of Chime's top topics: Array/Matrix, Graph Theory (traversal, shortest path), and Math. For each topic, solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on pattern recognition—identify when a problem is a variation of grid BFS or a two-pointer array scan.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Integration.** Stop solving problems in isolation. Start doing timed, 45-minute practice sessions with 2-3 Medium problems back-to-back. Use the Chime tag on TidyBit or LeetCode. Prioritize problems that combine topics (e.g., a Math problem that uses an array). In the final week, conduct at least 3 full mock interviews with a peer or using a platform that simulates the live coding environment.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process, Not Just Your Code.** From the moment you see the problem, talk. Explain your initial thoughts, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and verbalize your reasoning as you write. This is non-negotiable.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity First.** Your first goal is a working, brute-force solution. Then, and only then, discuss optimization. A correct, well-explained O(n²) solution is far better than a buggy, silent O(n) attempt.
3.  **Test Your Code Proactively.** Don't wait for the interviewer to ask. After writing your function, walk through a small but edge-case-heavy test case verbally. Mention what you're testing for (empty input, single element, large values).
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before you code, confirm assumptions about input size, format, and expected output. A question like "Can the graph contain cycles?" or "Should we handle negative numbers?" demonstrates thoroughness.

Mastering these Medium-level patterns in core topics is the most direct path to success in a Chime coding interview.
