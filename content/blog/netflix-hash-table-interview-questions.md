Hash Table questions appear in over one-third of Netflix’s technical interviews. With 11 out of 30 total questions tagged to this structure, it’s a core area you must master. Netflix’s systems rely on hash tables for high-speed data lookups—from user session management and content recommendation caching to distributed system routing. Understanding how to implement and apply hash tables demonstrates you can design efficient, scalable solutions, which is critical for handling their global traffic.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Netflix’s hash table problems typically focus on real-world applications rather than abstract theory. You can expect two main categories:

1.  **Direct Application Problems:** These questions involve using a hash table (dictionary, map, or set) as the primary tool to achieve O(1) average-time lookups. Classic examples include finding duplicates, checking anagrams, or implementing a cache (like an LRU cache). The goal is to recognize when a problem’s bottleneck is repeated lookups and to apply the hash table to remove it.
2.  **Hash Table as a Component:** Here, the hash table is part of a more complex algorithm or data structure. You might need to combine it with other patterns, such as two-pointer traversal, prefix sums, or graph traversal (BFS/DFS). For instance, you could use a hash table to store graph node states or to map prefixes to values for efficient substring searches.

The problems often test your ability to handle edge cases, such as collisions in design questions, and to discuss trade-offs between time and space complexity.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by solidifying the fundamentals: understand how hash functions, collision resolution (chaining vs. open addressing), and load factor work. Then, practice pattern recognition. Many problems are variations of a few core patterns: frequency counting, mapping for O(1) access, and caching.

A key pattern is **using a hash map to store a needed piece of information (like an index or count) to avoid a nested loop**. The classic "Two Sum" problem is a perfect example. The brute-force solution is O(n²). The optimal solution uses a hash map to store numbers we've seen, allowing us to check for the complement in O(1) time.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Recommended Practice Order

Tackle problems in this order to build competence progressively:

1.  **Fundamentals:** Implement a hash table from scratch. Solve basic frequency count problems (e.g., "First Unique Character in a String").
2.  **Core Patterns:** Practice the key application patterns: Two Sum variants, grouping problems (like "Group Anagrams"), and substring problems using sliding window with a hash map.
3.  **Advanced Data Structures:** Study how hash tables enable other structures. Implement an **LRU Cache**, which combines a hash map with a doubly-linked list. This is a frequent Netflix question.
4.  **Netflix-Specific List:** Finally, work through all 11 hash table questions on TidyBit's Netflix list. Simulate interview conditions by stating your reasoning aloud and discussing trade-offs.
