When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and scope of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Apple and Visa represent two distinct tiers of interview preparation intensity, with Apple requiring deeper algorithmic mastery and Visa emphasizing more practical, data manipulation problems. Here’s how their technical interview questions compare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Apple’s question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With 356 total questions (100 Easy, 206 Medium, 50 Hard), the sheer volume indicates a broader and deeper expected knowledge base. The high proportion of Medium and Hard problems suggests Apple interviews frequently test complex problem-solving, optimization, and advanced algorithm design. You must be comfortable not just with solutions, but with the most efficient approaches under constraints.

Visa’s question set is more manageable at 124 questions (32 Easy, 72 Medium, 20 Hard). The difficulty distribution still leans toward Medium, but the lower total count and fewer Hard problems imply a focus on core competency and reliable implementation rather than solving novel, highly complex algorithmic puzzles. The expectation is likely strong fundamentals and clean code.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. This is the core of data structure manipulation.

- **Apple** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a key topic. This signals an expectation to handle problems involving optimization, combinatorial counting, or complex state transitions, which are common in systems and low-level software design.
- **Visa** adds **Sorting** as a key topic. This emphasizes the importance of organizing data efficiently as a fundamental step in problem-solving, aligning with business logic and data processing tasks common in financial technology.

**Example Problem: Two Sum** (Leverages Hash Table)
A classic problem testing the use of a hash map for efficient lookups.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

**Example Problem: Apple's DP Focus**  
A problem like **"Longest Increasing Subsequence"** tests DP understanding, common at Apple.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_lis(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return Math.max(...dp);
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
    int maxAns = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxAns;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Visa first** if you are early in your interview preparation journey or prioritizing fintech. Its smaller, more foundational question set allows you to solidify core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) that are essential for any interview. Mastering these will build confidence and a strong base.

Prepare for **Apple first** only if you are already strong in core data structures and are specifically targeting top-tier product companies or roles demanding high algorithmic rigor. The extensive question bank and DP focus require a more significant time investment. Success with Apple's questions will inherently cover the core topics needed for Visa, making subsequent Visa preparation faster.

Ultimately, your choice should align with your target role and current skill level. Solidify fundamentals with Visa's scope, then deepen your algorithmic thinking with Apple's challenges.
