HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) coding interviews typically follow a standard technical screening process: one or two rounds of algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via video call with a shared code editor. The focus is on practical coding ability, clean implementation, and logical reasoning under time constraints. While the problems are generally aligned with common data structures and algorithms, understanding HPE’s specific tendencies can give you a decisive edge.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, HPE’s coding questions are distributed as follows: **Easy (67%), Medium (33%), Hard (0%)**. This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy. It means HPE prioritizes **fundamental proficiency and bug-free execution** over solving esoteric, complex puzzles. You are far more likely to encounter a well-known problem variant on a core topic than a never-before-seen challenge. The absence of Hard problems suggests the interview is designed to assess your baseline competency, coding speed, and communication skills. Your goal isn't to dazzle with advanced algorithms but to demonstrate consistent, reliable, and clean problem-solving.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics in HPE interviews are **Linked List, Recursion, Array, Backtracking, and Math**. Mastering these will cover the vast majority of questions you’ll face.

- **Linked List:** A staple for testing pointer/reference manipulation and edge-case handling (e.g., null head, single node). The most important pattern is the **two-pointer technique** for finding cycles or midpoints.
- **Recursion:** Used for problems involving trees, divide-and-conquer, or backtracking. Focus on writing clean base cases and understanding the call stack.
- **Array:** The most common data structure. Essential patterns include sliding window, two-pointer, and prefix sum for optimizing subarray problems.
- **Backtracking:** Frequently appears in medium-difficulty problems to generate permutations, subsets, or solve constraint-satisfaction puzzles like N-Queens.
- **Math:** Often involves number theory (prime checks, GCD) or clever arithmetic to avoid brute-force solutions. Efficiency is key.

Here is a crucial pattern for the top topic, Linked List: detecting a cycle using Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm (two-pointer technique).

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def hasCycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

```java
public class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is optimal given HPE’s question profile.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the five core topics. For each topic, learn the fundamental data structure or concept, then practice 3-5 easy problems to build fluency. Use resources like TidyBit’s HPE question list to find relevant problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Medium Problems.** Shift to solving medium problems that combine concepts (e.g., backtracking on arrays, recursion on linked lists). This week is about recognizing which pattern to apply. Time yourself to mimic interview conditions.

**Week 5: Mock Interviews and Review.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews, focusing on problems in the Easy-Medium range. Practice verbalizing your thought process from problem analysis to edge-case consideration. Record yourself to improve communication clarity.

**Week 6: Final Polish and Company-Specific Prep.** Revisit all previously solved problems to ensure you can code them quickly from scratch. Solve every HPE-tagged problem on TidyBit. Focus on writing production-ready code: meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and clear comments.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** Given the high percentage of Easy problems, a brute-force solution that works is often better than an optimal one you can't implement correctly under pressure. Start with a working solution, then optimize if time allows.
2.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Narrate your thought process before writing code. Explain the trade-offs of your approach (time vs. space complexity). This turns the interview into a collaborative session and demonstrates your reasoning skills.
3.  **Master Edge Cases.** For Linked Lists and Arrays, immediately test your logic against empty input, single-element input, and the first/last elements. Stating these upfront shows thoroughness.
4.  **Write Code as You Would on the Job.** Use proper indentation, name your variables clearly (`slow`, `fast` instead of `s`, `f`), and add brief inline comments for complex logic. This signals you understand maintainable code.
5.  **Practice with the HPE Stack.** While not always required, familiarity with common languages in HPE’s ecosystem (like Java or Python) can help you write idiomatic code and avoid language-specific pitfalls during the interview.

Success in an HPE coding interview hinges on solid fundamentals, consistent execution, and clear communication. Target the high-frequency topics, practice under timed conditions, and approach each problem methodically.
