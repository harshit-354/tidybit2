When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes. Visa and Coupang, while both testing core computer science fundamentals, present distinct profiles in volume, difficulty, and focus. Visa's dataset is larger and more balanced, whereas Coupang's is smaller but heavily weighted toward medium and hard problems, with a notable emphasis on Dynamic Programming.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Visa's repository of **124 questions** is significantly larger than Coupang's **53 questions**. This volume suggests a broader pool of potential problems, making pattern recognition crucial.

The difficulty distribution is also telling:

- **Visa (E32/M72/H20):** The spread is relatively balanced, leaning toward medium difficulty. The high number of easy questions (32) indicates a strong focus on assessing fundamental coding fluency and accuracy, likely in early screening rounds.
- **Coupang (E3/M36/H14):** The distribution is top-heavy. With only 3 easy questions, the focus shifts almost immediately to medium (36) and hard (14) challenges. This suggests their process is designed to quickly filter for candidates capable of solving complex algorithmic problems.

In practice, preparing for Visa may involve drilling a wider variety of fundamental problems, while preparing for Coupang requires deep, focused practice on challenging scenarios.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** manipulations. These form the essential toolkit for problem-solving. You must be proficient in two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and frequency mapping.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common to both)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common to both)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common to both)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

The critical divergence is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. It's a listed focus for Coupang but not for Visa. This means for Coupang, you must systematically prepare for DP patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and state machine problems. Visa's listed topics are more general, though DP could still appear.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Classic DP (Critical for Coupang)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Classic DP (Critical for Coupang)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Classic DP (Critical for Coupang)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Visa**. Its broader question set and stronger emphasis on easy-to-medium fundamentals provide a more comprehensive baseline. Mastering Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting for Visa will solidify the core skills required for about 80% of Coupang's listed topics. This approach builds a solid foundation efficiently.

Once comfortable with these fundamentals, pivot to **Coupang-specific preparation**. This phase should involve intense practice on medium and hard problems, with dedicated study sessions on Dynamic Programming patterns. The smaller question volume for Coupang allows for targeted, deep dives into their most frequent and challenging problem types.

In summary, use Visa's profile to build your generalist skills, then use Coupang's profile to sharpen your specialist skills in advanced problem-solving.
