When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each can dramatically improve your efficiency. Salesforce and Airbnb, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in their question banks. Salesforce's larger volume suggests a broader, more systematic assessment, while Airbnb's curated list indicates a focus on depth and practical problem-solving within their domain.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of questions associated with each company is the most immediate difference. Salesforce's list of **189 questions** is nearly three times the size of Airbnb's **64 questions**. This volume alone signals a key strategic point: for Salesforce, you are more likely to encounter a question you have seen before if you practice comprehensively. Their distribution—27 Easy, 113 Medium, 49 Hard—shows a heavy emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which form the core of their technical screen and on-site interviews.

In contrast, Airbnb's smaller bank of **64 questions** (11 Easy, 34 Medium, 19 Hard) suggests a more curated and potentially deeper exploration of each problem during the interview. The higher proportion of Hard questions (nearly 30% vs. Salesforce's 26%) hints that Airbnb may probe advanced problem-solving and optimization more frequently in later rounds. For candidates, this means Salesforce preparation is a marathon of breadth, while Airbnb preparation is a sprint of depth on high-quality problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the fundamental building blocks of software engineering. The top four topics are identical, just in a slightly different order:

- **Salesforce:** Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
- **Airbnb:** Array, Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming

This significant overlap means a strong foundation in these areas serves you for both. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays and strings, using hash maps for efficient lookups and state management, and applying dynamic programming for optimization problems.

The subtle difference in priority is telling. Salesforce leads with **Array and String** manipulation, emphasizing core data structure agility. Airbnb leads with **Array and Hash Table**, which often points to problems involving relationships, mapping, and system design aspects (e.g., designing a booking system, matching users). Expect Airbnb questions to more frequently involve real-world scenarios that map to their business, requiring you to model a problem using these structures.

```python
# Example: A common pattern using Hash Table (Python)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common pattern using Hash Table (JavaScript)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common pattern using Hash Table (Java)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your interview timeline and the nature of the companies.

**Prepare for Salesforce first if:** You have more time or are interviewing there first. Tackling its large question bank will force you to build wide-ranging competency across the fundamental topics. The skills you develop—especially speed and familiarity with a vast array of Medium-level problems—are highly transferable and will make Airbnb's smaller set feel manageable. It's a "breadth-first" approach.

**Prepare for Airbnb first if:** Your interview is imminent or you prefer deep, contextual practice. Mastering Airbnb's list requires understanding nuances and often translating a wordy, real-world prompt into a clean algorithmic solution. This depth of analysis is excellent practice for any system design or behavioral discussion that follows the coding round. You can then supplement with high-frequency Salesforce questions to fill any gaps in your knowledge.

Ultimately, start with the company whose interview comes first. If timing is equal, beginning with **Salesforce** provides a more comprehensive algorithmic workout that forms a stronger overall foundation.
