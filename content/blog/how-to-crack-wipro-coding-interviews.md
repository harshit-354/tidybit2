Wipro’s coding interviews are a critical gateway for landing a technical role at this global IT services leader. The process typically involves one or more technical rounds focusing on problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms. While the questions are not known for extreme complexity, they demand consistent accuracy, clean code, and logical clarity under time constraints. Understanding the specific patterns Wipro favors is the most efficient way to prepare.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Wipro coding questions reveals a clear pattern: **58% Easy** and **42% Medium** problems, with **0% Hard**. This distribution is your strategic guide. It means the interview is designed to assess foundational competency and reliable execution, not advanced algorithmic mastery. You will not face dynamic programming on obscure graphs or complex segment trees. Instead, you must demonstrate flawless command over core data structures. The expectation is to solve Easy problems quickly and correctly, and to systematically break down Medium problems without getting stuck. The absence of Hard questions shifts the success criteria from "solving the hardest puzzle" to "making zero mistakes on the fundamentals."

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Allocate 80% of your practice time to these areas.

- **Array:** The most frequent topic. Expect problems involving traversal, searching, and in-place manipulation (like moving zeros or rearranging elements). Mastering two-pointer and sliding window techniques is essential.
- **String:** Nearly as common as arrays. Focus on anagram checks, palindrome validation, and string transformation. Understanding how to efficiently compare and manipulate strings using character counting arrays or hash maps is key.
- **Math:** Problems often involve number properties, digit manipulation, or basic arithmetic sequences. Practice converting numbers to digits and back, and recognizing patterns like prime checks or GCD/LCM.
- **Sorting:** While sometimes the main problem, sorting is more often a crucial preprocessing step. Know how to use built-in sorts effectively and understand when sorting can simplify a problem (e.g., finding pairs or duplicates).
- **Hash Table:** The primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions. It's indispensable for frequency counting (in strings/arrays) and for solving problems like two-sum or finding duplicates.

The most important pattern across these topics is the **Two-Pointer technique**, especially for array and string problems. It allows for efficient in-place operations with O(n) time and O(1) space.

```python
# Example: Move all zeros in an array to the end, maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
def move_zeros(nums):
    # First pointer `insert_pos` tracks where the next non-zero should go.
    insert_pos = 0
    # Second pointer `i` traverses the array.
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            nums[insert_pos], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[insert_pos]
            insert_pos += 1
    return nums

# Example run: move_zeros([0,1,0,3,12]) -> [1,3,12,0,0]
```

```javascript
// Example: Move all zeros in an array to the end, maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
function moveZeros(nums) {
  // First pointer `insertPos` tracks where the next non-zero should go.
  let insertPos = 0;
  // Second pointer `i` traverses the array.
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== 0) {
      // Swap non-zero element into the correct position.
      [nums[insertPos], nums[i]] = [nums[i], nums[insertPos]];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return nums;
}

// Example run: moveZeros([0,1,0,3,12]) -> [1,3,12,0,0]
```

```java
// Example: Move all zeros in an array to the end, maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
    // First pointer `insertPos` tracks where the next non-zero should go.
    int insertPos = 0;
    // Second pointer `i` traverses the array.
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != 0) {
            // Swap non-zero element into the correct position.
            int temp = nums[insertPos];
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            nums[i] = temp;
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
}

// Example run: moveZeroes(new int[]{0,1,0,3,12}) -> array becomes [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured, topic-focused approach beats random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one core topic (Array, String, Math). Solve 10-15 Easy problems on each. Focus on writing syntactically perfect code and handling all edge cases (empty input, single element, large values).
- **Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Shift to Medium problems. Practice combining topics, like using a Hash Table to solve an Array problem (e.g., Two-Sum) or applying Sorting as a first step. Complete 1-2 Medium problems daily, focusing on deriving the logic before coding.
- **Week 5: Mock Interviews & Revision.** Simulate the actual interview. Set a 45-minute timer for 2 problems (one Easy, one Medium). Practice verbalizing your thought process aloud. Revisit and re-solve problems you initially found difficult.
- **Week 6: Final Polish & Company-Specific Practice.** In the final days, solve problems specifically tagged for Wipro. This gets you accustomed to their question style and difficulty level. Ensure you can run through your solutions mentally without an IDE.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one with bugs. State the brute-force approach first, then optimize. Interviewers want to see logical progression.
2.  **Communicate Continuously.** Never go silent. Narrate your analysis of the problem, possible approaches, trade-offs, and why you're choosing a particular data structure. This turns the interview into a collaboration.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through tests: empty input, single element, sorted/reversed input, large numbers, duplicate values. This demonstrates professional thoroughness.
4.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and maintain consistent indentation. Write modular functions instead of monolithic blocks.
5.  **Manage Your Time.** If stuck on a Medium problem for more than 10-15 minutes, ask for a hint. It shows pragmatism. Allocate time to ensure your Easy solution is fully tested and explained.

Success in Wipro's coding interview is a test of disciplined fundamentals. By focusing on high-frequency topics, mastering core patterns like two-pointer, and emphasizing clear communication, you can demonstrate the reliable problem-solving skills they value.
