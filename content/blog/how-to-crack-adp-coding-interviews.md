ADP’s technical interviews for software engineering roles are designed to assess problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. The process typically involves one or two rounds of live coding, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or CoderPad, focusing on algorithmic challenges. While ADP’s business domain revolves around HR and payroll software, the coding interviews test fundamental computer science concepts. Success hinges on systematic preparation around a predictable set of topics and difficulty levels.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, ADP’s coding interview question distribution is typically: **2 Easy (50%), 1 Medium (25%), and 1 Hard (25%)**. This breakdown is crucial for strategy. The presence of a Hard problem means you cannot rely solely on mastering basics; you must be prepared for complex optimization. However, the two Easy questions are non-negotiable—you must solve them flawlessly and quickly to build confidence and save time for the tougher challenges. The Medium problem is often the differentiator, testing your ability to apply standard algorithms to slightly novel situations. Your goal should be to ace the Easy and Medium problems completely, and make significant, well-reasoned progress on the Hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics in ADP interviews are **Array, Math, String, Combinatorics, and Number Theory**. Here’s what to know for each:

- **Array:** The cornerstone. Expect problems involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and prefix sums. Master in-place operations and efficient searching/sorting.
- **Math & Number Theory:** Problems often involve properties of numbers, modular arithmetic, prime checking, or GCD/LCM. These can appear in isolation or as part of a larger combinatorial problem.
- **String:** Closely tied to array techniques. Focus on palindrome checks, anagram comparisons, substring searches, and string manipulation using character arrays or builders for efficiency.
- **Combinatorics:** This is where problems can become Hard. You’ll need to recognize scenarios involving counting, permutations, or combinations, often requiring dynamic programming or clever mathematical formulas to avoid brute force.

The most critical pattern across these topics, especially for Array and String problems, is the **Two-Pointer Technique**. It’s essential for solving problems in O(n) time with O(1) extra space, such as finding pairs, removing duplicates, or checking palindromes.

```python
# Two-pointer: Check if a string is a palindrome.
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric chars (if required)
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Two-pointer: Check if a string is a palindrome.
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Skip non-alphanumeric chars
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[left])) left++;
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[right])) right--;
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Two-pointer: Check if a string is a palindrome.
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Skip non-alphanumeric chars
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this period to **Arrays and Strings**. Solve 15-20 problems from each topic, covering all major patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, hash maps for lookups, and basic sorting applications. Ensure you can implement these patterns in your primary language without hesitation.
- **Week 3: Core Math.** Dive into **Math, Number Theory, and basic Combinatorics**. Practice prime number algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes), GCD (Euclidean algorithm), modular operations, and simple counting problems. Understand how to use loops and recursion for these calculations.
- **Week 4: Advanced Patterns & Combinatorics.** Tackle **dynamic programming (DP)**, as it’s frequently the key to harder Combinatorics problems (e.g., "count ways to..." problems). Start with classic DP problems (Fibonacci, coin change) before moving to combinatorial DP. This is also the week to attempt Medium-Hard problems from previous topics.
- **Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Integration.** Stop learning new topics. Use this phase for timed practice. Simulate the actual interview format: solve 1 Easy, 1 Medium, and 1 Hard problem in a 60-75 minute session. Use platforms like TidyBit to find company-tagged problems. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly while coding.

## Key Tips

1.  **Clarify Before Coding.** ADP problems can have edge cases related to business logic (e.g., date ranges, integer bounds). Always ask clarifying questions about input size, valid ranges, and output format before writing the first line of code.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** For the Hard problem, start with a brute-force solution and verbally state its complexity. Then, systematically optimize it. This demonstrates structured problem-solving even if you don’t reach the optimal solution.
3.  **Practice Verbalizing.** Explain your reasoning out loud while practicing. In the interview, narrate your thought process—why you chose a data structure, what trade-offs you’re considering. This turns a silent coding session into a collaborative discussion.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** After writing your code, don’t just run the given example. Manually walk through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, negative numbers, or already-sorted data. State these tests to the interviewer.

Mastering these patterns and executing a disciplined study plan will position you strongly for the ADP coding interview. The key is to transform your problem-solving approach into a repeatable, communicable process.
