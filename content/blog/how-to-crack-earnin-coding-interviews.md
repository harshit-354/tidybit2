Earnin’s technical interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills and coding fluency. Candidates typically face a series of live coding rounds focusing on algorithmic challenges, with an emphasis on clean, efficient, and well-explained solutions. The goal is to see how you think through real-world problems, not just academic puzzles. Understanding the specific patterns they favor is the fastest path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear and actionable pattern: **83% of questions are Medium difficulty, with the remaining 17% being Easy. There are no Hard problems.** This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy.

It means Earnin is primarily evaluating your core competency—your ability to reliably and efficiently solve the standard problems that form the backbone of day-to-day software engineering. They are testing for a strong foundation, not obscure algorithmic knowledge. The absence of Hard problems suggests that extreme optimization or complex data structure combinations are less important than demonstrating mastery over fundamental topics with clear, bug-free code under interview pressure. Your goal is to become exceptionally consistent and fast with Medium-level challenges.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Based on the data, you should prioritize these five areas. Mastery here will cover the vast majority of what you'll encounter.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, subarray calculations, and sorting logic.
- **Matrix:** A 2D extension of array problems. Focus on traversal patterns (spiral, diagonal), and in-place rotations or modifications.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Essential for problems involving frequency counting, duplicate detection, and complement searching (like Two Sum).
- **Two Pointers:** A versatile technique for optimizing solutions on sorted arrays or strings. Crucial for problems involving pair searching, palindrome validation, or removing duplicates.
- **String:** Often combined with other topics. Practice common operations like reversal, anagram checks, and parsing.

The most important pattern to internalize is **Hash Table for complement searching**, as it's the core of the classic Two Sum problem and its many variants. Here’s how it looks across languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # Problem guarantees one solution
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // Problem guarantees one solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // Problem guarantees one solution
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building**
Dedicate each day to one of the five core topics. For each topic, study the key patterns (e.g., for Two Pointers, learn the opposite-ends and fast-slow pointer patterns). Solve 5-8 curated Medium problems per topic, ensuring you understand both the brute-force and optimal approaches.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed**
Start solving mixed Medium problem sets without knowing the topic in advance. This simulates the interview environment. Focus on identifying the correct pattern within the first few minutes of reading the problem. Time your sessions. Begin mock interviews to practice verbalizing your thought process.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Drill and Refinement**
In the final stretch, exclusively practice problems tagged with Earnin or from similar companies. Re-solve any problems you struggled with in the first phase. Polish your communication: practice explaining your approach before coding, discussing time/space complexity, and walking through a test case.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** With no Hard problems, a complete, correct, and readable Medium solution is better than an optimal but buggy or overly complex one. Get a working solution first, then optimize if time allows.
2.  **Communicate Your Process Relentlessly.** Narrate your thoughts from the moment you read the problem. Explain your consideration of brute force, why you're choosing a hash table or two pointers, and walk through a small example with your code. This turns your interview into a collaborative session.
3.  **Validate Input and Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before coding, check for edge cases (empty array, negative numbers, single element). Ask questions like, "Is the array sorted?" or "Can I assume the input is valid?" This shows professional diligence.
4.  **Write Neat, Modular Code.** Use descriptive variable names (`seen` instead of `map`). Extract logical blocks into well-named helper functions if it improves clarity. Sloppy code creates bugs and gives a poor impression, even if the algorithm is correct.

Mastering these core topics and strategies will make you exceptionally well-prepared for Earnin's technical screen. Consistency on Medium problems is your key metric for readiness.
