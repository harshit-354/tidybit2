When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Meta and TikTok, while both leaders in social technology, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. A targeted approach, informed by their question statistics, is crucial for effective preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of Meta's question bank is its most defining feature. With **1,387** cataloged questions, it dwarfs TikTok's **383**. This volume reflects Meta's longer history of standardized technical interviews and its vast engineering organization.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **Meta (E414/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty (55%), with a significant number of Easy (30%) and a solid block of Hard (15%). This suggests a well-rounded interview that tests fundamentals thoroughly before escalating to complex problem-solving.
- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty (68%), with fewer Easy (11%) and Hard (21%) questions. This indicates a laser focus on core algorithmic competency and the ability to handle non-trivial problems under pressure. The higher _proportion_ of Hard questions, despite the smaller total, can make the interview feel intensely challenging.

In short, Meta tests breadth and depth across a wide spectrum, while TikTok concentrates its evaluation on a narrower, more intense band of medium-to-hard problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily prioritize foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the essential core for both. Mastering these is non-negotiable.

The key differentiator lies in their secondary focus:

- **Meta** shows a strong emphasis on **Math** problems. This includes number theory, probability, and other mathematical reasoning challenges that appear in system design and optimization contexts.
- **TikTok** places a much higher relative weight on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Given its smaller question pool, the presence of DP as a top-tier topic means you are significantly more likely to encounter a DP problem in a TikTok interview.

```python
# Example of a common DP pattern (Coin Change) more emphasized at TikTok
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example of a common DP pattern (Coin Change) more emphasized at TikTok
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common DP pattern (Coin Change) more emphasized at TikTok
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by the breadth of the target company's question bank.

**Prepare for TikTok first if you are interviewing at both.** TikTok's focused question set (383 questions) with its concentration on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Dynamic Programming allows for a deep, targeted study session. Achieving high proficiency in this narrower scope is a manageable medium-term goal. Success here builds a strong core competency that is directly transferable.

**Then, expand your study for Meta.** Use the foundation built for TikTok and expand outward. Meta's vast question bank (1,387 questions) requires covering more ground, particularly in Math and other secondary topics. The strategy here is not to memorize every question but to achieve broad exposure to many problem patterns and variations, solidifying the fundamentals you already mastered.

Ultimately, a tiered approach is most efficient: master the intense focus of TikTok's core, then scale up to cover the extensive landscape of Meta's challenges.
