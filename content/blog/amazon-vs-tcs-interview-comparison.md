When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Amazon and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one a global product-based tech giant, the other a massive IT services and consulting firm. Their approaches to technical assessments differ significantly in scale, depth, and focus, which directly impacts how a candidate should prepare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions associated with each company is the most striking difference. On TidyBit, Amazon is linked to **1,938 questions**, while TCS has **217 questions**. This disparity reflects Amazon's vast, well-documented interview history across its many technical roles and its use of a standardized, leetcode-style assessment process.

The difficulty breakdown further highlights their different hiring bars:

- **Amazon (E530/M1057/H351):** The distribution is balanced, with a heavy emphasis on **Medium (M1057)** problems. This is characteristic of top-tier product companies, where the core of the interview is designed to assess problem-solving and algorithm optimization under pressure. The significant number of **Hard (H351)** questions indicates that roles at Amazon often require tackling complex system design or advanced algorithmic challenges.
- **TCS (E94/M103/H20):** The focus is overwhelmingly on **Easy (E94)** and **Medium (M103)** problems. The presence of Hard questions is minimal **(H20)**. This aligns with TCS's profile as an IT services company, where interviews often test fundamental programming competency, logical reasoning, and the ability to understand and implement solutions rather than invent highly optimized algorithms from scratch.

```python
# Example of a common "Easy" level problem (likely for both)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example of a more complex "Medium/DP" problem (more Amazon-focused)
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example of a common "Easy" level problem (likely for both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example of a more complex "Medium/DP" problem (more Amazon-focused)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (const coin of coins) {
    for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common "Easy" level problem (likely for both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example of a more complex "Medium/DP" problem (more Amazon-focused)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the essential foundation for interviews at both Amazon and TCS. Mastery of these topics is non-negotiable.

The key divergence is in the advanced topics:

- **Amazon** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. DP questions are a staple for assessing optimal substructure and state management in complex problems, consistent with their difficulty profile.
- **TCS** lists **Two Pointers** as a key topic. This technique is often used for solving array and string problems efficiently (e.g., finding pairs, reversing strings, sliding window variants) and is a logical step up from the most basic manipulations, fitting their focus on fundamentals and clean implementation.

This suggests that while preparation for both companies starts in the same place, Amazon preparation must go deeper into advanced algorithm paradigms like DP, Graph Theory (implied by their question bank), and system design.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and timeline.

**Prepare for TCS first if:** You are early in your data structures and algorithms (DSA) journey or are specifically targeting IT services roles. The TCS question set provides a focused, manageable curriculum to build core competency. Solving their Easy and Medium problems will solidify your grasp of Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Two Pointers—which is also the perfect foundation for any other interview.

**Prepare for Amazon first if:** You are aiming for product-based or FAANG-level companies, even if not immediately interviewing at Amazon. The Amazon question list is a comprehensive representation of the modern technical interview standard. Tackling their Medium-difficulty problems will force you to develop the problem-solving rigor and depth required for the most competitive roles. Success with Amazon-level preparation will make TCS-style interviews feel comparatively straightforward.

In practice, a hybrid approach is effective: use the **TCS list to build your core foundation** and then expand into the **Amazon list to increase your depth and tackle higher-difficulty problems**. The core topics overlap significantly, making this a natural progression.
