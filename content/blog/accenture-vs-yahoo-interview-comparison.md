When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Accenture and Yahoo, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question profiles to help you prioritize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company's interview process.

**Accenture** has a significantly larger pool, with **144 questions** cataloged. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards easier and medium problems: Easy (65), Medium (68), with only 11 Hard questions. This suggests Accenture's technical screening often focuses on assessing fundamental coding competency, logical reasoning, and problem-solving approach rather than on solving highly complex algorithmic puzzles. The high volume indicates a broad but generally accessible question bank.

**Yahoo** has a more concentrated set of **64 questions**. The distribution is similar in proportion but smaller in scale: Easy (26), Medium (32), Hard (6). The lower total volume, coupled with a comparable difficulty spread, implies that Yahoo's interviews might draw from a more consistent or predictable set of core problems. The presence of Hard questions, though fewer, confirms that some roles may require tackling advanced scenarios.

**Key Takeaway:** Accenture requires broader familiarity with a wide range of standard problems, while Yahoo demands deep, confident mastery of a smaller core set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures, but with subtle priority differences.

The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Accenture:** Array, String, Hash Table, Math
- **Yahoo:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

This strong overlap means core preparation is highly transferable. Proficiency with array manipulation, string algorithms, and efficient use of hash tables for lookups and frequency counting is essential for both.

The primary distinction is Yahoo's explicit inclusion of **Sorting** as a top-4 topic. This signals that questions involving sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort concepts) or problems where sorting is a key optimization step (like finding meeting overlaps or the "Kth Largest Element") are particularly relevant for Yahoo.

```python
# Example: A common problem for both (Hash Table + String)
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    count = {}
    for char in s:
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1
    for char in t:
        if char not in count or count[char] == 0:
            return False
        count[char] -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
// Example: A common problem for both (Hash Table + String)
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
  const count = {};
  for (let char of s) {
    count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
  }
  for (let char of t) {
    if (!count[char]) return false;
    count[char]--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: A common problem for both (Hash Table + String)
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
    int[] count = new int[26];
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        count[c - 'a']++;
    }
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        count[c - 'a']--;
        if (count[c - 'a'] < 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your timeline and the roles you're targeting.

**Start with Accenture if:** You are in the early stages of interview prep or applying to consulting/engineering roles where demonstrating robust fundamentals is key. The large number of primarily Easy and Medium problems makes it an excellent training ground. Solving a wide variety from Accenture's list will efficiently build your muscle memory for the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) that are also crucial for Yahoo.

**Start with Yahoo if:** You are already comfortable with basics and are targeting a software engineering role at Yahoo or a similar product-based company. Focus on mastering Yahoo's list, paying special attention to **Sorting-based problems** and the fewer Hard questions. This path ensures deep, confident proficiency in the exact problem types you're most likely to encounter.

**Optimal Strategy:** A combined approach is most effective. First, solidify your fundamentals by working through a selection of Easy and Medium problems from **Accenture's** extensive list. This builds breadth. Then, transition to **Yahoo's** list to deepen your understanding, ensuring you can solve its core problems fluently and can handle its more challenging questions. This sequence ensures you are well-prepared for either company's interview.
