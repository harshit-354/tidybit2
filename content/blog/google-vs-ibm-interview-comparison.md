When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. Google and IBM, while both industry giants, have distinct interview landscapes. Google's process is famously rigorous and broad, while IBM's tends to be more focused on core computer science fundamentals. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark contrast in scale and depth between the two companies' known interview question pools.

**Google** maintains a massive repository of over **2,200 questions**, categorized by a clear difficulty distribution: **588 Easy, 1,153 Medium, and 476 Hard**. This volume reflects Google's comprehensive and notoriously challenging interview process, which is designed to test not just coding ability but also problem-solving under pressure, system design, and behavioral fit. The high number of Hard questions indicates you must be prepared for complex algorithmic challenges.

**IBM**'s known question pool is significantly smaller, at around **170 questions**, with a very different difficulty spread: **52 Easy, 102 Medium, and 16 Hard**. This suggests IBM's technical screen and onsite interviews place a stronger emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems** that test solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. The low number of Hard questions implies that while you should be ready for a challenge, the primary hurdle is demonstrating clean, correct, and efficient code for standard problems.

```python
# Example of a classic "Medium" problem common to both: Two Sum.
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# This tests hash table understanding, a key topic for both.
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, as these are foundational to algorithmic problem-solving.

**Google's** top topics extend to **Hash Table** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The prominence of DP, a challenging topic often associated with Hard problems, aligns with their difficulty distribution. You must be comfortable breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

**IBM's** focus shifts to **Two Pointers** and **Sorting**. These are essential techniques for solving a wide range of Medium-difficulty problems efficiently, especially those involving arrays and strings. This focus suggests IBM prioritizes clean implementation of fundamental algorithms and space/time optimization.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# IBM-favored technique: Two Pointers for a sorted array.
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1

# Google-favored category: A simple DP problem (Climbing Stairs).
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers (IBM focus)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}

// Dynamic Programming (Google focus)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers (IBM focus)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}

// Dynamic Programming (Google focus)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your interview timeline and the foundational nature of the topics.

**Prepare for IBM first if you are new to technical interviews.** Its focused question bank and emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems involving Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, and Sorting provide an excellent foundation. Mastering these will build the core skills needed for any coding interview. The lower volume is less daunting for initial study.

**Prepare for Google first only if you are already strong in fundamentals and have a Google interview scheduled.** The breadth and depth required are immense. Success demands fluency in advanced topics like Dynamic Programming and the stamina to tackle a high volume of challenging problems. Use IBM-style problems as a warm-up or to reinforce basics, but allocate the majority of your time to Google's broader and harder question set.

Ultimately, IBM preparation builds a strong algorithmic core. Google preparation requires building on that core with advanced techniques and extensive practice. Start with the company you have an interview with, but use the overlap in Arrays and Strings to your advantage.
