When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of different companies can dramatically improve your efficiency. Infosys and DE Shaw represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of hiring volume and technical rigor. A comparison of their question banks reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis, which should directly inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant difference in the total number of questions and their difficulty breakdown.

**Infosys** has a larger question bank with **158 questions**, distributed as 42 Easy, 82 Medium, and 34 Hard. This higher volume reflects Infosys's mass recruitment model, where they hire thousands of engineers annually. The interview process often involves a standardized test, leading to a broad but sometimes predictable set of problems. The distribution is weighted toward Medium-difficulty questions, suggesting a focus on core problem-solving competency.

**DE Shaw** has a more curated bank of **124 questions**, with a sharper difficulty curve: 12 Easy, 74 Medium, and 38 Hard. The significantly lower number of Easy questions and higher proportion of Hard questions indicates a highly selective process aimed at identifying top-tier problem solvers. DE Shaw's interviews are known for their depth and complexity, often involving multi-layered problems or optimization challenges beyond standard algorithm implementation.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures and algorithms, but with different nuances.

**Common Core Topics (Array, Dynamic Programming, String):**
These form the backbone of both companies' interviews. You can expect problems involving array manipulation, classic DP patterns, and string operations.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

**Distinctive Focus Areas:**

- **Infosys** includes **Math** as a top topic. This often involves number theory, combinatorics, or mathematical logic problems that are common in online coding rounds.
- **DE Shaw** emphasizes **Greedy** algorithms. This aligns with their focus on optimization problems, where you must devise a rule for making the locally optimal choice at each step to reach a global optimum. Mastering proof of optimality for greedy approaches is often key.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A classic Greedy problem (Fractional Knapsack - value/weight)
def fractional_knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    items = [(v/w, w, v) for v, w in zip(values, weights)]
    items.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0]) # sort by value/weight ratio
    total_value = 0.0
    for ratio, weight, value in items:
        if capacity >= weight:
            capacity -= weight
            total_value += value
        else:
            total_value += value * (capacity / weight)
            break
    return total_value
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic Greedy problem (Fractional Knapsack - value/weight)
function fractionalKnapsack(values, weights, capacity) {
  let items = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    items.push({ ratio: values[i] / weights[i], weight: weights[i], value: values[i] });
  }
  items.sort((a, b) => b.ratio - a.ratio);
  let totalValue = 0.0;
  for (let item of items) {
    if (capacity >= item.weight) {
      capacity -= item.weight;
      totalValue += item.value;
    } else {
      totalValue += item.value * (capacity / item.weight);
      break;
    }
  }
  return totalValue;
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic Greedy problem (Fractional Knapsack - value/weight)
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class FractionalKnapsack {
    public static double getMaxValue(int[] values, int[] weights, int capacity) {
        Item[] items = new Item[values.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
            items[i] = new Item(values[i], weights[i]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(items, Comparator.comparingDouble((Item i) -> i.ratio).reversed());
        double totalValue = 0.0;
        for (Item item : items) {
            if (capacity >= item.weight) {
                capacity -= item.weight;
                totalValue += item.value;
            } else {
                totalValue += item.value * ((double) capacity / item.weight);
                break;
            }
        }
        return totalValue;
    }
    static class Item {
        int value, weight;
        double ratio;
        Item(int v, int w) {
            value = v;
            weight = w;
            ratio = (double) v / w;
        }
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your experience level and target role.

If you are a **beginner or early in your interview preparation**, start with **Infosys**. The larger bank with more Easy and Medium problems provides a broader, more forgiving foundation. Solving these will solidify your understanding of core topics like Arrays, Strings, and basic DP. The Math problems will also sharpen your analytical thinking. This base is essential and transferable.

If you are an **experienced coder or specifically targeting top-tier quantitative or research roles**, you should prioritize **DE Shaw's** problem set. The focus on Medium and Hard problems, especially involving Greedy algorithms and optimized DP, will push you to think about edge cases, time/space complexity optimization, and elegant solution design. This level of preparation is demanding but will make you competitive for most top companies.

Ultimately, a solid strategy is to build a foundation with Infosys-style questions and then ramp up the difficulty with DE Shaw's curated set. Mastering the common core topics first ensures you are prepared for any interview, while the distinctive focus areas allow you to tailor your final preparation to the specific company's profile.
