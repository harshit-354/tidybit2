Ericsson’s coding interviews are a critical gateway for software and network engineering roles. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms, often conducted via a coding platform. While the questions test fundamental competency, their specific distribution and topical focus require a targeted approach.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a distinct pattern: a heavy skew towards **Easy questions (67%)** with a significant spike for **Hard questions (33%)**. There are no Medium-difficulty problems in this sample.

This distribution is strategic. The Easy questions act as a filter, assessing basic coding fluency, attention to detail, and the ability to deliver clean, working code under interview conditions. Failing here is often a non-starter. The solitary Hard question serves as a differentiator, designed to separate competent candidates from exceptional ones. It tests advanced problem-solving, familiarity with complex data structures (like the Trie), and the stamina to navigate a multi-step problem. Your preparation must account for this bimodal spread: flawless execution on fundamentals and dedicated practice for high-complexity challenges.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study should prioritize these areas, which cover the core of Ericsson's question bank.

- **String:** Expect manipulations, parsing, and validation. Master two-pointer techniques and sliding windows.
- **Stack:** Essential for parsing, validation (e.g., parentheses), and problems requiring LIFO logic, like evaluating expressions.
- **Array:** The foundation. Be proficient in traversal, in-place operations, and prefix sum techniques.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A key differentiator for the Hard problems, crucial for efficient prefix-based search and storage.
- **Math:** Often involves number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation-based problems derived from mathematical rules.

For the **Trie**, a top-tier topic for Hard problems, understanding the implementation is non-negotiable. Here is the core structure:

<div class="code-group">

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
```

```javascript
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isEndOfWord = false;
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true;
  }

  search(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    return node.isEndOfWord;
  }

  startsWith(prefix) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of prefix) {
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

```java
class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
    boolean isEndOfWord = false;
}

class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            node.children.putIfAbsent(ch, new TrieNode());
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            if (!node.children.containsKey(ch)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        return node.isEndOfWord;
    }

    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            if (!node.children.containsKey(ch)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        return true;
    }

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is essential to cover the breadth and depth required.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Drill **Easy** problems on **Arrays** and **Strings**. Aim for speed and 100% correctness.
- Study **Stack** fundamentals. Solve ~15 classic problems (e.g., valid parentheses, min stack).
- Practice basic **Math** problems involving simulation and number theory.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Data Structures & Pattern Recognition**

- Dedicate significant time to **Trie** theory and implementation. Solve 5-10 Hard problems that utilize it.
- Revisit Arrays and Strings, but focus on **Hard**-level questions that combine these with other concepts.
- Start doing timed mock interviews focusing on a mix of Easy and Hard problems.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews**

- No new topics. Conduct at least 8-10 full mock interviews simulating Ericsson's format (e.g., one Easy followed by one Hard).
- Analyze every mistake. Was it a syntax error (Easy failure) or a flawed approach (Hard failure)?
- Re-implement your most challenging Trie and Stack solutions from memory.

## Key Tips

1.  **Perfect Your Easy Game.** Write code for simple problems as if it will go directly to production—impeccable readability, proper edge-case handling, and optimal space/time complexity from the start.
2.  **Communicate Your Trie Thought Process.** When a Hard problem hints at prefixes (search, autocomplete), explicitly state, "This suggests a Trie could optimize the prefix search to O(prefix length)." Then implement it cleanly.
3.  **Practice Time Boxing.** Allocate strict time limits: 12-15 minutes for an Easy, 30-35 for a Hard. If stuck, articulate a fallback brute-force approach before optimizing.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** For String and Array problems, always test empty inputs, single-element inputs, and large, repetitive inputs verbally before declaring completion.
5.  **Master One Language.** Use Python for speed, Java for type-explicit structure, or JavaScript for full-stack roles. Be deeply fluent in its standard library for your core topics.

Success with Ericsson's interview hinges on dual mastery: robotic precision on fundamentals and creative, structured problem-solving for high-complexity challenges. Target your practice accordingly.
