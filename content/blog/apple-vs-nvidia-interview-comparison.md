When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. Both Apple and NVIDIA are engineering-first companies, but their interview content reveals distinct priorities. Apple's questions are more numerous and cover a broader range of difficulty, while NVIDIA's list is more compact with a heavier emphasis on fundamental data manipulation. A strategic candidate will use this data to tailor their preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Apple's list of **356 questions** is more than double NVIDIA's **137 questions**. This doesn't necessarily mean Apple's interviews are harder, but it suggests a wider pool of potential problems and a greater expectation of breadth.

The difficulty distribution is more revealing:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty (206), with a significant number of Easy (100) and a substantial set of Hard (50). This spread indicates that Apple interviews are designed to test core competency, problem-solving depth, and the ability to handle complex challenges. You must be prepared for a rigorous, multi-faceted technical screen.
- **NVIDIA (E34/M89/H14):** The distribution follows a similar pattern but is skewed even more heavily toward Medium fundamentals (89 out of 137). The number of Hard questions (14) is relatively small. This suggests NVIDIA's interviews strongly emphasize solid, efficient implementation of standard algorithms over solving highly novel or obscure problems. Mastery of core concepts is paramount.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the core of both question banks. This is the essential toolkit for most software engineering roles.

The key differentiator is in the advanced topics:

- **Apple** explicitly includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. The presence of 50 Hard questions often correlates with complex DP, graph, or tree problems. Preparing for Apple requires dedicated study of DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, state machines, etc.).
- **NVIDIA**' listed topics include **Sorting** instead of DP. While sorting is a fundamental concept, its explicit mention alongside the lower count of Hard questions implies a focus on algorithmic reasoning, optimization, and efficient data manipulation (e.g., custom comparators, merging intervals) rather than advanced DP. DP questions may still appear, but are less of a defining feature.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, focusing on hash tables:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **NVIDIA's** profile. Its focus on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting represents the absolute core of algorithmic interviewing. Achieving deep fluency with these topics—solving most of the Medium problems—will build a rock-solid foundation. This preparation covers a large portion of what you'll see at Apple as well.

Once comfortable with the fundamentals, expand your preparation for **Apple**. This involves:

1.  Tackling a larger volume of Medium problems for breadth.
2.  Dedicating significant time to **Dynamic Programming**.
3.  Practicing a selection of Hard problems to develop the stamina and advanced pattern recognition needed for their more difficult rounds.

In essence, NVIDIA's list is a strong subset of Apple's. Mastering NVIDIA's core will make you competitive there and prepare you for about 60-70% of Apple's focus areas. The final step for Apple is to layer on DP and advanced problem-solving depth.
