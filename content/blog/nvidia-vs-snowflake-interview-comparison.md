When preparing for technical interviews at NVIDIA and Snowflake, you'll encounter distinct patterns in question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. Both companies test core computer science fundamentals, but their engineering priorities—hardware-adjacent systems and high-performance computing at NVIDIA versus large-scale data warehousing and cloud services at Snowflake—influence their interview focus. A strategic preparation plan requires understanding these differences.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

NVIDIA's question pool is larger and leans toward easier problems. With 137 total questions categorized as 34 Easy, 89 Medium, and 14 Hard, the emphasis is clearly on Medium-difficulty problem-solving. This suggests interviews are designed to assess strong, reliable competency in core algorithms under typical constraints. The relatively low proportion of Hard questions (just over 10%) indicates that while you must be proficient, the goal is often to evaluate clean, correct implementation and sound reasoning rather than tackling extreme algorithmic complexity.

Snowflake's profile is different. With 104 total questions (12 Easy, 66 Medium, 26 Hard), the set is smaller but significantly more challenging. The proportion of Hard questions is roughly 25%, more than double NVIDIA's. This signals that Snowflake interviews likely probe deeper into optimization, edge cases, and advanced problem-solving, consistent with their domain of distributed data systems and query processing where efficiency at scale is paramount.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** manipulations. These form the essential toolkit for data processing problems.

**NVIDIA's** fourth most frequent topic is **Sorting**. This aligns with performance-critical work in graphics, simulation, and parallel computing where organizing data efficiently is fundamental. Expect problems involving custom comparators, in-place operations, and leveraging sorted properties.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Custom sorting in Python
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by start time
```

```javascript
// Example: Custom sorting in JavaScript
let intervals = [
  [1, 3],
  [2, 6],
  [8, 10],
  [15, 18],
];
intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // Sort by start time
```

```java
// Example: Custom sorting in Java
import java.util.Arrays;
int[][] intervals = {{1,3},{2,6},{8,10},{15,18}};
Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
```

</div>

**Snowflake's** fourth key topic is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This reflects the importance of tree and graph traversal for working with hierarchical data, file systems, or dependency graphs within data platforms. Mastery of both recursive and iterative DFS is crucial.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Recursive DFS on a binary tree
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order processing
    dfs(node.left)
    # In-order processing
    dfs(node.right)
    # Post-order processing
```

```javascript
// Example: Recursive DFS on a binary tree
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Pre-order processing
  dfs(node.left);
  // In-order processing
  dfs(node.right);
  // Post-order processing
}
```

```java
// Example: Recursive DFS on a binary tree
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Pre-order processing
    dfs(node.left);
    // In-order processing
    dfs(node.right);
    // Post-order processing
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **NVIDIA**. The higher volume of Medium problems provides a broad and efficient training ground for reinforcing core algorithmic patterns. Achieving speed and accuracy on problems involving arrays, strings, hash tables, and sorting will build a solid foundation. This practice directly translates to a significant portion of Snowflake's question pool as well.

After establishing core proficiency, pivot to **Snowflake's** specific demands. Intensify practice on Hard problems and deepen your understanding of graph traversal algorithms, particularly DFS and its applications (cycle detection, pathfinding, backtracking). The smaller question pool means you can target their problem set more directly, but the higher difficulty requires you to build on a strong base.

Ultimately, preparing for NVIDIA first creates a natural on-ramp to the more challenging Snowflake interview. Focus on clean, optimal solutions for NVIDIA's medium problems, then layer on the advanced problem-solving and graph theory needed for Snowflake.
