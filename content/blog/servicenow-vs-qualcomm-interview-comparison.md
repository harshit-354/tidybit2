When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. ServiceNow and Qualcomm, while both established technology firms, have distinct engineering focuses that are reflected in their interview question profiles. ServiceNow, a leader in enterprise cloud computing for digital workflows, emphasizes software engineering for scalable platforms. Qualcomm, a semiconductor and telecommunications giant, focuses on hardware-adjacent software, embedded systems, and communication technologies. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty, and topic distribution to help you tailor your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in both the total number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

**ServiceNow** has a larger overall question pool with **78 questions**, categorized as 8 Easy, 58 Medium, and 12 Hard. This indicates a significant emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which often test the core application of data structures and algorithms under moderate constraints. The relatively high number of total questions suggests you should prepare for a broad range of scenarios, though the concentration on Medium problems means deep mastery of fundamental patterns is more critical than solving esoteric Hard problems.

**Qualcomm** has a smaller pool of **56 questions**, with a distribution of 25 Easy, 22 Medium, and 9 Hard. The higher proportion of Easy questions is notable. This could reflect an interview process that includes more foundational screening or questions tied closer to practical, implementation-focused tasks rather than complex algorithmic optimization. The lower total volume might mean a slightly more predictable question set, but preparation should not be underestimated.

In short, ServiceNow's profile suggests grinding Medium problems is key, while Qualcomm's requires solid, error-free fundamentals.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies test core computer science fundamentals, but with different weights that hint at their engineering priorities.

**Common Topics:** Both lists include **Array** and **String** manipulation. These are universal basics. You must be proficient in iterating, searching, sorting, and manipulating these structures.

**ServiceNow's Emphasis:** Its top topics are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The inclusion of Hash Table and DP is significant. Hash Table questions often involve system design concepts (e.g., caching, indexing) relevant to cloud services. DP problems test optimal substructure and are common in interviews for platforms dealing with complex rule engines and workflows.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP problem (Coin Change)
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example DP problem (Coin Change)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (coin <= i) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example DP problem (Coin Change)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin <= i) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

</div>

**Qualcomm's Emphasis:** Its key topics are **Array, Two Pointers, String, and Math**. The prominence of **Two Pointers** and **Math** is telling. Two Pointers is heavily used in optimizing array/string traversal and is common in problems related to signal processing or memory-constrained environments. Math problems can involve bit manipulation, number theory, or physics calculations relevant to low-level systems and communications protocols.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Example Two Pointers problem (Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target role and the foundational overlap.

If you are interviewing at **both**, start with **Qualcomm**. Its emphasis on Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, and Math forms a strong, manageable core. Mastering these will cover a large portion of its question pool and build essential skills. The higher count of Easy problems allows you to build confidence and speed with fundamentals, which is never wasted effort.

After solidifying that base, pivot to **ServiceNow** preparation. This involves layering on the additional, more complex topics of **Hash Tables** and **Dynamic Programming**. The Medium-difficulty focus means you'll need to practice applying these structures in more intricate problem scenarios, often involving state management and optimization. The skills from Qualcomm prep (like array manipulation) will directly transfer, making this an efficient progression.

In essence, Qualcomm's list is a strong subset of ServiceNow's. Mastering the former provides an excellent foundation for tackling the latter's broader and slightly more advanced challenges.
