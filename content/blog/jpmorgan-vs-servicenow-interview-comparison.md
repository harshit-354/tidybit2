When preparing for technical interviews at major tech and finance companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both JPMorgan and ServiceNow are prominent recruiters of software engineering talent, but their technical interviews reflect their distinct business domains and engineering cultures. While both emphasize core data structures, their question difficulty distributions and focus areas reveal different priorities. This comparison analyzes their question banks to provide a strategic preparation roadmap.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Both companies have a substantial and identical total volume of 78 questions in their respective tagged question banks on TidyBit. However, the distribution of difficulty levels is markedly different.

**JPMorgan** questions are skewed significantly toward easier and medium problems. Their breakdown is approximately **25 Easy, 45 Medium, and 8 Hard** questions. This suggests their technical screening often focuses on assessing solid foundational knowledge, clean code, and problem-solving clarity under typical interview constraints. The relatively low proportion of Hard questions indicates that while they may test advanced concepts, the primary gate is competency with standard algorithms.

**ServiceNow** presents a more challenging overall profile. Their breakdown is roughly **8 Easy, 58 Medium, and 12 Hard** questions. The overwhelming dominance of Medium-difficulty problems, coupled with a notably higher count of Hard questions, signals an interview process that delves deeper into algorithmic optimization and complex scenario handling. Candidates should be prepared for multi-step reasoning and less straightforward applications of data structures.

```python
# Example of a foundational "Medium" problem common to both:
# Group Anagrams (Hash Table, String)
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        key = ''.join(sorted(s))
        anagram_map[key].append(s)
    return list(anagram_map.values())
```

```javascript
// Example of a foundational "Medium" problem common to both:
// Group Anagrams (Hash Table, String)
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const s of strs) {
    const key = s.split("").sort().join("");
    if (!map.has(key)) map.set(key, []);
    map.get(key).push(s);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

```java
// Example of a foundational "Medium" problem common to both:
// Group Anagrams (Hash Table, String)
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            String key = new String(chars);
            map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(key).add(s);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

## Topic Overlap

The core topic overlap is significant, highlighting the universal importance of these fundamental areas. Both companies heavily feature **Array, String, and Hash Table** questions. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews, testing a candidate's ability to manipulate data, implement efficient lookups, and handle edge cases.

The key differentiator is the fourth prominent topic for each company.

- **JPMorgan** prominently includes **Sorting**. This aligns with financial data processing, where ordering, merging, and organizing datasets are common tasks. Expect problems involving custom comparators, interval merging, or leveraging sorted order for optimized solutions.
- **ServiceNow** prominently includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This reflects a need for engineers who can solve complex, scalable optimization problems, likely related to workflow automation, resource scheduling, or state management in their platform. Mastery of DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, state machines) is a critical differentiator here.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company whose profile best matches your current skill level.

If you are **earlier in your interview preparation journey** or have interviews with both companies, **prioritize JPMorgan's question list**. The higher number of Easy problems and the focus on foundational topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) provide an excellent ramp to build core competency. Mastering these will solidify the skills needed for a majority of ServiceNow's Medium problems as well.

If **ServiceNow is your primary target or you have a strong foundation already**, you should **focus directly on their question bank**. The high density of Medium and Hard problems requires dedicated practice. Specifically, you must invest significant time in **Dynamic Programming**. Being comfortable with DP is often the barrier between passing and excelling in a ServiceNow-style interview. After covering the shared Array/String/Hash Table core, shift your focus to DP patterns and complex problem decomposition.

Ultimately, the shared core means preparation for one company significantly benefits the other. The strategic difference lies in the depth required for ServiceNow and the specific emphasis on Sorting for JPMorgan.
