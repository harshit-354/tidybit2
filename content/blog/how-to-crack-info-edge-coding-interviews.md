Info Edge (known for Naukri.com, 99acres, Jeevansathi) conducts rigorous coding interviews focused on practical problem-solving. Their process typically involves 2-3 technical rounds assessing data structures, algorithms, and system design, followed by a managerial discussion. The coding problems are designed to test clarity of thought, clean implementation, and efficiency under constraints—skills directly applicable to their large-scale consumer platforms.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Info Edge coding questions reveals a clear pattern: **8 questions total, with 1 Easy (13%), 6 Medium (75%), and 1 Hard (13%)**. This distribution is telling. The overwhelming majority are Medium difficulty, indicating they prioritize strong foundational competency over solving obscure puzzles. The single Hard problem likely serves as a tiebreaker for top candidates. The single Easy question is often a warm-up or used to quickly filter for basic coding literacy. Your preparation should be laser-focused on mastering Medium problems across core topics. If you can reliably solve Medium problems within 25-30 minutes, you are in a strong position.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Depth in these areas is more valuable than breadth across esoteric subjects.

**Array & Two Pointers:** These are frequently combined. Expect problems involving searching, partitioning, or finding pairs/triplets in sorted or unsorted arrays. The two-pointer technique is a fundamental tool for achieving O(n) time on many array challenges.
**Hash Table:** The go-to data structure for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, checking for duplicates, or complement searching (like the classic Two Sum). It's often the first optimization step beyond a brute-force approach.
**Sorting:** Rarely the final answer but a critical preprocessing step. Many efficient solutions for Array, Two Pointers, or even Linked List problems require the input to be sorted first. Understand the trade-offs of in-place sorts.
**Linked List:** Tests pointer manipulation skills. Common patterns include cycle detection, reversals, and merging sorted lists. These problems assess your ability to handle edge cases (null pointers, single-node lists) without losing track of references.

Here is the **Two Sum** problem, a quintessential example combining Hash Table and Array concepts, implemented in three languages. This pattern of using a hash map to store complements for instant lookup is fundamental.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. This plan assumes 2-3 hours of focused practice daily.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate each day to one primary topic from the list above. For each topic, study the key patterns (e.g., for Two Pointers: opposite ends, fast/slow). Solve 5-8 curated Medium problems per topic. Focus on writing syntactically perfect, runnable code from the first attempt.
**Weeks 3-4: Mixed Practice & Speed.** Stop solving by topic. Use platforms that provide random Medium problems. Time yourself strictly: 25 minutes to understand, devise an approach, code, and test. This simulates interview pressure. In the final days, attempt 2-3 full sets of 2-3 problems back-to-back.
**Week 5: Mock Interviews & Gaps.** Conduct at least 3-4 mock interviews with peers or mentors. Ask them to pick problems from Info Edge's known question pool. Record and review your performance, noting hesitations or communication gaps. Use this week to ruthlessly revisit any weak patterns.
**Week 6: Final Review & System Design.** Light coding maintenance—solve 1-2 problems daily to stay sharp. Dedicate significant time to system design fundamentals (HLD/LLD), as Info Edge often includes a design round for scalable web applications like their job portals or matrimonial sites.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Verbally walk through your thought process, discuss brute-force, then optimize. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving journey as much as the final code.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A complete, bug-free solution for a Medium problem is better than a half-implemented, optimal one. Handle edge cases explicitly (empty input, single element, large values).
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and structure your code with proper spacing. This demonstrates professionalism.
4.  **Practice on Paper/Whiteboard.** You might not have an IDE with autocomplete. Regularly practice writing code by hand to build fluency and avoid dependency on tools.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before starting, confirm assumptions about input size, sorting, uniqueness, and output format. This shows attention to detail and prevents solving the wrong problem.

Mastering these patterns and executing this disciplined strategy will significantly increase your confidence and performance. For targeted practice, explore the specific problems Info Edge has asked.
