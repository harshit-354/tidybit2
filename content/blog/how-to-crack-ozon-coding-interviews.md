Ozon’s technical interview process typically involves multiple stages, including an initial online assessment, followed by one or more technical interviews focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and system design. The coding interviews are known for being practical and data-structure heavy, emphasizing clean, efficient solutions over theoretical complexity. Success hinges on methodical preparation aligned with their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 13 recent Ozon coding questions reveals a clear distribution: **Easy (62%, 8 questions)**, **Medium (31%, 4 questions)**, and **Hard (8%, 1 question)**. This breakdown is strategic. The high volume of Easy questions serves as a filter for fundamental competency—candidates who stumble here are unlikely to proceed. The Medium questions are the true differentiator, testing the ability to apply core data structures to slightly more complex scenarios. The single Hard problem acts as a final gatekeeper for top-tier candidates, often combining multiple concepts.

For you, this means a balanced approach is key. Mastery of fundamentals is non-negotiable. You must solve every Easy problem flawlessly and quickly to conserve mental energy for the Medium challenges that will decide your outcome. The Hard problem is a bonus round; a solid attempt with a suboptimal solution can still be acceptable if you've aced the rest.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of topics. Prioritize these:

- **Array & String (Core):** These are the fundamental data structures for most problems. Focus on two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and prefix sums.
- **Sorting (Enabler):** Rarely the final answer, but a crucial preprocessing step for many efficient solutions (e.g., "Kth Largest Element").
- **Hash Table (Workhorse):** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups, frequency counting, and duplicate detection. Essential for optimizing time complexity.
- **Stack (Niche but Critical):** Appears in parsing, validation (parentheses), and next-greater-element problems. Know its LIFO property inside out.

The most important pattern across these topics is the **Two-Pointer technique**, especially for array and string manipulation. It provides an O(n) time, O(1) space solution for many problems involving sorted data or palindromes.

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a string is a palindrome using two pointers."""
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric characters (if required)
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    // Move pointers past non-alphanumeric chars
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]+$/i.test(s[left])) left++;
    while (left < right && !/^[a-z0-9]+$/i.test(s[right])) right--;
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Advance pointers to next alphanumeric character
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) left++;
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) right--;
        if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(left)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(right))) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: **Foundation.** Drill Easy problems on the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table). Aim for speed and accuracy. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter by Ozon and 'Easy' difficulty. Implement every solution from scratch.

Weeks 3-4: **Core Competency.** Shift entirely to Medium problems on the same topics. This is where you build pattern recognition. For each problem, first identify the topic and potential data structures. If stuck after 20 minutes, study the solution, then re-implement it the next day without help.

Weeks 5-6: **Integration and Mock Interviews.** Practice a mix of Easy and Medium problems in timed sessions (45-60 minutes). Complete 1-2 full mock interviews weekly, simulating the actual pressure. In the final week, review your error log and re-solve previous mistakes. Allocate a few hours to study one or two classic Hard problems (like "Merge k Sorted Lists") to understand the pattern, but don't dwell on them.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Don't code in silence. Explain your thought process aloud, discuss trade-offs between different approaches, and state your complexity analysis before writing the first line of code. This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** First, state the brute-force solution. Then, identify the bottleneck and optimize it using the appropriate data structure (e.g., replacing a nested loop with a hash table). This shows a methodical approach to problem-solving.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring a solution complete, verbally run through tests: empty input, single element, large values, and sorted/reversed inputs. Mentioning this proactively shows thoroughness.
4.  **Write Clean, Compilable Code.** Use consistent naming, proper indentation, and avoid overly clever one-liners. Write code as if it will be reviewed and maintained. This is especially valued in practical, product-focused companies like Ozon.

Your goal is to demonstrate consistent, reliable skill, not flashes of genius. Target the Medium problems, solidify the fundamentals, and communicate clearly.
