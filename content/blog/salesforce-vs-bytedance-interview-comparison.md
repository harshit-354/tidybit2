# Salesforce vs ByteDance: Interview Question Comparison

Preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies requires targeted practice. Salesforce and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok) are both major players, but their interview processes and technical focuses differ significantly. This comparison analyzes their question banks on TidyBit to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of questions associated with each company.

**Salesforce** has a massive bank of **189 questions**, heavily weighted towards Medium (113) and Hard (49) problems. This large, challenging set suggests that Salesforce's technical screen is comprehensive and rigorous, likely involving multiple rounds of problem-solving that test depth of knowledge and endurance. The high number of Hard problems indicates you should be prepared for complex algorithmic thinking.

**ByteDance** has a more focused bank of **64 questions**, with a strong emphasis on Medium difficulty (49). The distribution (6 Easy, 49 Medium, 9 Hard) points to an interview that prioritizes speed, clean implementation, and problem-solving on commonly tested patterns under time pressure. The lower volume doesn't mean it's easier; it means the problems are highly curated and representative.

```python
# Example of a Medium-difficulty pattern common to both:
# Two Sum (Hash Table approach)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Sum in JavaScript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Sum in Java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four core areas: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is your strategic advantage.

- **Array and String** manipulations form the basis of most questions. Expect problems involving sliding windows, two pointers, and sorting.
- **Hash Table** is the go-to data structure for optimizing lookups and solving problems like the one above.
- **Dynamic Programming** appears in both sets, especially for Medium and Hard questions. Mastering classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, palindromic subsequences) is non-negotiable.

The key difference lies in context and application. Salesforce's larger question bank may include more business-logic-wrapped problems or scenarios. ByteDance's set, given its product focus, might lean towards problems related to real-time data streams, efficient string processing for text/content, or optimization—though this is often abstracted in coding challenges.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **ByteDance's question list**. Its focused, Medium-heavy set is an efficient training ground. Solving these 64 questions will force you to master the core patterns that appear in 90% of interviews. You'll build speed and confidence with the fundamental topics that both companies test.

Once comfortable, move to **Salesforce's extensive bank**. Use it to build depth, stamina, and to tackle the greater number of Hard problems. Practicing from this larger pool will prepare you for longer interview loops and more complex edge cases. If you can handle a significant portion of Salesforce's list, ByteDance's focused set will feel manageable.

In short: use ByteDance's questions for efficient pattern mastery. Use Salesforce's questions for depth and endurance training.
