When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Uber and Nutanix represent two distinct points on the tech interview spectrum: one is a massive, established player with a vast question pool, and the other is a focused infrastructure company with a more concentrated set of problems. A strategic comparison helps you allocate your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The difference in question volume is the most striking contrast. With 381 documented questions, Uber's interview process is highly data-mined and predictable in its common topics, but less predictable regarding which specific problem you'll get. The distribution (54 Easy, 224 Medium, 103 Hard) shows a clear emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which often involve multi-step reasoning and optimization.

Nutanix, with 68 questions, has a much smaller public repository. Its distribution (5 Easy, 46 Medium, 17 Hard) reveals an even stronger skew toward Medium and Hard problems relative to its total size. This suggests that while you may encounter a narrower range of problem _types_, the problems themselves are less likely to be simple.

**Key Takeaway:** For Uber, breadth of practice across their high-frequency topics is essential. For Nutanix, depth of understanding within a smaller core set is more critical, as you have a higher chance of facing a challenging variation of a known pattern.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** manipulations. These form the foundational layer for most algorithmic interviews. A problem combining a hash map with array indices is a safe bet for both.

The primary divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Uber strongly emphasizes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a topic known for its difficulty and pattern-based nature. Nutanix, conversely, shows a higher relative frequency of **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, often applied in tree/graph traversal and backtracking scenarios.

This difference likely reflects their engineering domains. Uber's problems involving optimal routing, pricing, or resource allocation often map to DP optimization. Nutanix's infrastructure and systems background leads to more problems involving hierarchical data structures or state exploration (DFS).

Here is a classic problem that could appear at either, solved with a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Nutanix first** if you are interviewing with both. The rationale is efficiency: mastering Nutanix's core list forces you to build deep competency in Array, Hash Table, String, and DFS. This foundation is 100% transferable to Uber's interviews. You can then layer on dedicated, extensive practice for Uber's large volume of questions, with a special focus on Dynamic Programming, which is its unique, high-weight differentiator.

If you are only preparing for one, tailor your plan accordingly. For Uber, use their massive question bank for pattern recognition, but ensure you can solve Medium problems fluently and tackle common Hard DP problems. For Nutanix, practice their listed questions thoroughly, but more importantly, ensure you can handle complex variations on core algorithms, as their smaller pool means they likely delve deeper into each concept.

**Final Strategy:** Build core algorithmic strength with Nutanix's focused list, then expand to Uber's breadth. Always solve problems on a whiteboard, articulate your reasoning, and practice the system design and behavioral rounds that are integral to both companies' processes.
