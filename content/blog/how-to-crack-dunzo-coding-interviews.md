Dunzo’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong problem-solving skills and the ability to handle complex, real-time logistics challenges through code. The process typically involves multiple rounds focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design, with a heavy emphasis on writing clean, efficient solutions under pressure. Success requires targeted preparation on a specific set of advanced topics.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing recent patterns reveals a demanding technical screen. The question distribution skews heavily toward advanced problems: **0% Easy, 50% Medium, and 50% Hard**. This breakdown is critical. It means you cannot rely on solving straightforward array or string manipulations to pass. The interview is designed to filter for candidates who can not only implement standard algorithms but also adapt and combine them to solve novel, computationally intensive problems. You must be comfortable with ambiguity and optimizing solutions for both time and space complexity from the outset. Expect to encounter problems that feel like "Hard" even if they are classified as "Medium."

## Top Topics to Focus On

Given the data, your study should be intensely focused. Here are the top five topics, ordered by priority, with the key pattern to master for each.

**1. Dynamic Programming (DP)**
This is the most crucial topic. Dunzo's problems in logistics and optimization (e.g., minimum cost, resource allocation) often map directly to DP paradigms. You must be fluent in both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
_Key Pattern: 0/1 Knapsack._ Many optimization problems are variants of this classic.

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][w])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array(n + 1)
    .fill()
    .map(() => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w]);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i-1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][w]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

**2. Array**
Array manipulation forms the backbone of most problems. Focus on in-place operations, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques, often needed in conjunction with other patterns like Prefix Sum.

**3. Prefix Sum**
This is a fundamental optimization technique for problems involving frequent range sum queries or subarray sums, common in analyzing delivery route data or time-series metrics.

**4. String**
String problems often involve parsing, matching, or transformation. Practice advanced techniques like rolling hash (Rabin-Karp) for substring searches and dynamic programming for edit distance or palindrome problems.

**5. Math**
Mathematical reasoning is frequently tested, especially combinatorics, probability, and modular arithmetic. Be prepared to derive formulas to avoid brute-force solutions.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Week 1-2: **Foundation & Core Patterns.** Dedicate this phase entirely to **Dynamic Programming**. Start with fundamental problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs), move to 1D and 2D DP (0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Coin Change), and finish with DP on strings and partitions. Solve at least 15-20 DP problems of varying difficulty.

Week 3-4: **High-Frequency Topics.** Deep dive into **Array** and **Prefix Sum**. Master subarray problems (maximum sum, product, with conditions) using Kadane's algorithm and prefix sums. Integrate **String** algorithms here. Solve another 20-25 problems, focusing on Medium and Hard levels.

Week 5: **Integration & Mock Interviews.** Start solving problems that combine topics, like a DP problem that uses array manipulation and prefix sums. Begin taking timed mock interviews that include a Hard problem. Analyze your performance—focus on communication and edge cases.

Week 6: **Final Review & Weakness Targeting.** Revisit all previously solved problems, especially those you found challenging. Do 2-3 full mock interviews per week. Ensure you can clearly explain the time/space complexity trade-offs for every solution you write.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second.** With a 50% Hard rate, brute-force solutions are non-starters. Spend the first 5-10 minutes of any problem discussing multiple approaches and their complexities before writing a single line of code. Interviewers want to see your optimization thought process.
2.  **Practice Writing Perfect Code Under Time.** Your solution must be syntactically correct, handle edge cases, and be optimized on the first draft. Practice on a whiteboard or in a plain text editor without auto-complete to simulate the interview environment.
3.  **Communicate Your DP State Clearly.** When solving Dynamic Programming problems, verbally define your `dp` array (e.g., "`dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to reach state `i` with constraint `j`") before implementing it. This demonstrates structured thinking.
4.  **Don't Ignore "Medium" Problems.** The Medium problems at this level are often Hard problems in disguise or require a non-obvious trick. Treat every problem as if it has an optimal, non-trivial solution.

Targeted, intense practice on these patterns is your only path to success. Start with Dynamic Programming today.
