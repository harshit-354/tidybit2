When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes in their hiring process. JPMorgan and Twitter, representing finance and social media respectively, have distinct technical screening approaches. Their publicly available question breakdowns show clear differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis, which should guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

JPMorgan's list comprises **78 questions**, with a difficulty distribution of **Easy: 25, Medium: 45, Hard: 8**. This larger volume suggests a broader, more comprehensive question bank. The heavy skew toward Medium-difficulty problems (58% of total) indicates they prioritize assessing solid, practical problem-solving skills over extreme algorithmic cleverness. The 8 Hard questions likely target senior or specialized roles.

Twitter's list is smaller at **53 questions**, with a distribution of **Easy: 8, Medium: 33, Hard: 12**. The significantly lower number of Easy questions and higher proportion of Hard questions (23% vs. JPMorgan's 10%) points to a more selective process that quickly moves to challenging material. The emphasis is on filtering for strong algorithmic thinkers.

```python
# Example of a common Medium-difficulty pattern: Two Sum (frequent in both lists)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. This is the core overlap. Mastery of these fundamentals is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key difference lies in the fourth most frequent topic. JPMorgan lists **Sorting**, which aligns with finance's need for data processing and order-based logic. Twitter lists **Design**, reflecting the system architecture challenges inherent in building a large-scale social platform. This distinction is critical: JPMorgan interviews may delve more into data manipulation algorithms, while Twitter interviews will likely include a system design component, especially for mid-to-senior levels.

```python
# Example of a Sorting-related problem: Merge Intervals (relevant for JPMorgan)
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **JPMorgan first** if you are early in your interview practice cycle. The larger question bank with a higher ratio of Easy/Medium problems provides a wider foundation. Mastering their list will solidify your core data structure and algorithm skills (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Sorting), which are directly transferable to Twitter's requirements. It builds confidence through volume.

Prepare for **Twitter first** if you already have a strong algorithmic foundation and need to ramp up on advanced problems and design. The higher concentration of Hard questions demands deeper mastery. You must also allocate significant time to system design principles, which is a separate, substantial study area beyond pure coding.

Ultimately, the shared focus on Array, String, and Hash Table problems means preparation for one significantly benefits the other. Start with the company whose difficulty curve best matches your current skill level to build momentum.
