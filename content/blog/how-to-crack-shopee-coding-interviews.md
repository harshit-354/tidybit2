Shopee’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving speed and coding fundamentals. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on data structures and algorithms, often conducted on platforms like Codility or HackerRank, followed by discussions about your approach. The questions are designed to be practical, reflecting the scalable system challenges a fast-growing e-commerce platform faces daily. Success hinges on precise execution of core patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Shopee interview questions reveals a clear pattern: **70% are Medium difficulty, and 30% are Easy. Hard problems are virtually absent.** This distribution is strategic. It indicates Shopee prioritizes consistent, reliable implementation of standard algorithms over solving obscure, complex puzzles. They are testing for strong fundamentals, clean code, and the ability to handle common technical challenges under time pressure. Your goal isn't to showcase genius-level insights but to demonstrate you can efficiently and correctly apply well-known solutions. Missing an edge case on a Medium problem is far more costly than not solving a Hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-frequency topics. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array (Top Topic):** The foundation. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A core topic for Medium problems. Focus on classic patterns like knapsack, longest increasing subsequence, and pathfinding.
- **Two Pointers:** Essential for optimizing array and string problems to O(n) time, such as finding pairs or removing duplicates.
- **String:** Often combined with Two Pointers or Sliding Window for anagrams, palindromes, and encoding tasks.
- **Linked List:** Tests pointer manipulation skills with problems on reversal, cycle detection, and merging.

For Arrays and Two Pointers, the **Sliding Window** pattern is particularly powerful for subarray/substring problems. Here is a template for finding the longest substring without repeating characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charSet = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (charSet.has(s[right])) {
      charSet.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    charSet.add(s[right]);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A focused, topic-driven approach is key.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
_ Days 1-7: Deep dive into **Array** and **String** manipulations. Practice all Easy and common Medium problems. Implement sorting, searching, and prefix sum techniques.
_ Days 8-14: Master **Two Pointers** and **Sliding Window**. Then, move to **Linked List**. Solve problems until pointer manipulation feels intuitive.

**Weeks 3-4: Mastering Medium Difficulty** \* Days 15-28: This block is for **Dynamic Programming**. Start with 1D problems (Fibonacci, climbing stairs), then 2D (knapsack, LCS). Spend at least 10 days here. Revisit previous topics for 2-3 problems daily to maintain sharpness.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews**
_ Days 29-35: Solve mixed-topic Medium problems under timed conditions (45 minutes). Focus on identifying the correct pattern quickly.
_ Days 36-42: Conduct at least 5-7 full mock interviews. Practice verbalizing your thought process before coding. Simulate the actual interview environment.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Medium First:** Allocate 70% of your practice time to Medium problems from the top five topics. A fast, correct Medium solution is your ticket to the next round.
2.  **Write Production-Ready Code Immediately:** Don't write a sloppy solution to refactor later. Start with clear variable names, handle edge cases (empty input, single element) from the outset, and include brief comments. Interviewers evaluate code quality directly.
3.  **Communicate Your Process, Not Just the Answer:** Before you write a line of code, state the brute-force approach, then explain the optimization (e.g., "We can improve this from O(n²) to O(n) using a hash map to store indices."). This demonstrates structured thinking.
4.  **Time Box Your Struggle:** If you're stuck on an approach for more than 5 minutes, state it. Say, "I'm considering a DP approach here because we have overlapping subproblems, but I'm working on defining the state." This invites collaboration and shows composure.

Your preparation should be a drill, not an exploration. Know the patterns, write clean code fast, and communicate clearly.
