When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Amazon and Airbnb, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and topical emphasis. A strategic approach tailors your preparation to the company you're targeting first.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of preparation required for these two companies differs vastly. Amazon's question bank is massive, with 1,938 documented questions spanning Easy (530), Medium (1,057), and Hard (351) difficulties. This volume reflects Amazon's broad hiring needs across many roles and teams. The distribution shows a heavy emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which are the core of most software engineering interviews. You must be prepared for a wide array of scenarios, but mastering Medium-level problems is the critical path.

In stark contrast, Airbnb's curated list contains only 64 questions (Easy 11, Medium 34, Hard 19). The smaller, more focused set suggests that Airbnb's interview process may rely more heavily on a consistent, known set of problems or that their technical screen is more standardized. The difficulty distribution still skews toward Medium, but the manageable total count means deep, repeated practice on these specific questions is a viable and highly effective strategy.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a strong foundation in core data structures and algorithms. The top topics are nearly identical: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap means building proficiency in these areas serves you for both companies.

- **Arrays & Strings:** Expect questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and string manipulation.
- **Hash Tables:** Crucial for optimizing lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting or matching pairs.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key differentiator for harder problems; you must be comfortable with classic patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, or DP on strings/arrays.

The main difference lies in the application context. Amazon questions often relate to scalable systems, data processing, and operational logic (e.g., merging log files, optimizing delivery routes). Airbnb questions might more frequently involve date manipulation, reservation scheduling, or string parsing related to user profiles or listings, often requiring clean, bug-free implementation.

```python
# Example: A common two-pointer pattern for a sorted array
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common two-pointer pattern for a sorted array
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common two-pointer pattern for a sorted array
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your timeline and goals. **Prepare for Amazon first if you have time.** The breadth and depth required to tackle Amazon's vast question bank will inherently cover the core topics needed for Airbnb. Mastering Medium-difficulty problems on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and DP will build a robust foundation. After this, you can efficiently transition to Airbnb's specific list to familiarize yourself with their problem style and context.

**Prepare for Airbnb first if you are short on time or have an imminent interview.** The focused list allows for rapid, targeted preparation. You can achieve a high level of familiarity with their entire question corpus, which is not feasible with Amazon's list. However, this strategy builds a narrower skill set that may not fully translate to the wider range of problems Amazon could present.

Ultimately, the shared core topics are your anchor. Build strong fundamentals there, then expand for Amazon's volume or specialize for Airbnb's focus.
