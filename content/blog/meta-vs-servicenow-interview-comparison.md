When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and scope of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Meta and ServiceNow represent two distinct tiers in terms of interview preparation volume and emphasis, despite sharing core technical topics. This comparison breaks down their question statistics, topic overlap, and provides a strategic approach to preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of their question pools.

**Meta** maintains a massive, well-documented repository of 1,387 questions, categorized by difficulty: 414 Easy, 762 Medium, and 211 Hard. This volume reflects Meta's broad product scope (social platforms, advertising, VR) and its historical emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving. Preparing for Meta is a marathon; you must be ready to encounter nuanced variations on classic problems across all difficulty levels, with a strong focus on Medium-tier challenges.

**ServiceNow**, in contrast, has a much more concentrated set of 78 questions: 8 Easy, 58 Medium, and 12 Hard. This smaller, Medium-heavy pool is typical for enterprise software companies. The interview process is more targeted, often focusing on practical problem-solving and system design relevant to workflow automation and cloud services, with a less exhaustive algorithmic gauntlet than FAANG companies.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize several foundational data structures, but with different secondary priorities.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are prevalent for both. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews. You can expect questions that test manipulation, iteration, and lookup efficiency using these structures.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

**Diverging Emphasis:**

- **Meta** lists **Math** as a key topic, which often includes number theory, probability, or bit manipulation problems.
- **ServiceNow** explicitly highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This indicates a notable portion of their Medium/Hard questions likely involve optimization problems (e.g., knapsack, longest subsequence), requiring mastery of memoization or tabulation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your interview timeline and the transferability of skills.

**Prepare for ServiceNow First if:** You are interviewing with them sooner, or you want to build confidence with a more manageable question set. Mastering ServiceNow's list, especially its Dynamic Programming problems, will solidify your core data structure skills and problem-solving patterns. This foundation is entirely transferable.

**Prepare for Meta First if:** Your primary goal is landing a role at Meta, or you have a longer runway. Conquering Meta's vast question bank is a more comprehensive undertaking that will inherently cover the depth and breadth needed for ServiceNow and most other companies. The skills learned here are the ultimate superset.

**Strategic Approach:** Start with the shared core (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables). Then, branch based on the company: dive deep into Math problems for Meta, and drill Dynamic Programming for ServiceNow. Regardless of order, use the smaller, focused ServiceNow list for targeted practice and the expansive Meta list for endurance training and exposure to edge cases.
