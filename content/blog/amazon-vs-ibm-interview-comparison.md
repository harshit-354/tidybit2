When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly impact your preparation efficiency. Amazon and IBM represent two distinct ends of the tech industry spectrum—one a fast-moving product and cloud giant, the other a venerable enterprise and consulting leader. Their interview question profiles reflect these differences in scale, pace, and technical depth. A strategic comparison of their question volume, difficulty, and core topics reveals clear priorities for candidates.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions associated with each company is the most striking difference. On TidyBit, **Amazon** is linked to **1,938 questions**, with a difficulty breakdown of Easy (530), Medium (1,057), and Hard (351). This massive pool indicates a highly standardized, data-driven interview process where questions are recycled and widely reported. Preparation must be broad, with a heavy emphasis on conquering Medium-difficulty problems, which form the core of their technical screens.

In contrast, **IBM** is linked to **170 questions**, with a breakdown of Easy (52), Medium (102), and Hard (16). The volume is an order of magnitude smaller, suggesting a less rigid question bank or a process that may rely more on interviewer discretion or fundamental problem-solving. The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions, with relatively few Hard problems. This makes IBM's technical scope appear more approachable and concentrated.

**Key Takeaway:** Amazon requires extensive, wide-ranging practice. IBM demands deep mastery of a more focused set of core concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures. **Array** and **String** problems are critical for interviews at both Amazon and IBM. This is the primary overlap.

However, their secondary focuses diverge, signaling different evaluation priorities:

- **Amazon's** next most frequent topics are **Hash Table** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The prevalence of Hash Table questions aligns with Amazon's focus on efficient data lookup and system design fundamentals. The significant number of DP questions (a notoriously difficult topic) underscores their emphasis on optimized algorithms and recursive thinking for complex problems, typical of large-scale system challenges.
- **IBM's** secondary topics are **Two Pointers** and **Sorting**. These are classical algorithmic techniques often used to solve array and string problems efficiently. This focus suggests IBM interviews may prioritize clean, logical implementation of fundamental algorithms over the advanced, optimization-heavy DP problems common at Amazon.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using a Two Pointer technique, which is more emphasized at IBM:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write_index = 1
    for read_index in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read_index] != nums[read_index - 1]:
            nums[write_index] = nums[read_index]
            write_index += 1
    return write_index
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let writeIndex = 1;
  for (let readIndex = 1; readIndex < nums.length; readIndex++) {
    if (nums[readIndex] !== nums[readIndex - 1]) {
      nums[writeIndex] = nums[readIndex];
      writeIndex++;
    }
  }
  return writeIndex;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int writeIndex = 1;
    for (int readIndex = 1; readIndex < nums.length; readIndex++) {
        if (nums[readIndex] != nums[readIndex - 1]) {
            nums[writeIndex] = nums[readIndex];
            writeIndex++;
        }
    }
    return writeIndex;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be dictated by your target companies and timeline.

If you are interviewing at **both**, or if your goal is to build the strongest general foundation, **prepare for Amazon first**. The rigorous breadth required for Amazon—especially the practice with Dynamic Programming and a vast number of Medium problems—will inherently cover the core Array, String, and Two Pointer concepts emphasized at IBM. Mastering Amazon's question bank will make IBM's focused set feel like a subset of your prepared material.

If you are only interviewing at **IBM**, or are new to technical interviews, starting with the **IBM-focused list** is a more efficient, confidence-building strategy. You can achieve deep mastery of the 170 questions, solidifying fundamentals with Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, and Sorting. This provides a strong platform which you can later expand upon if needed for other companies.

Ultimately, Amazon's process tests for scalability and depth under pressure, while IBM's seems to assess solid fundamentals and clear logic. Tailor your drill-down accordingly.
