When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. PayPal and Expedia, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. This comparison analyzes their question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

PayPal's question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With **106 total questions** (Easy: 18, Medium: 69, Hard: 19), the sheer volume indicates a broader pool of potential problems. The distribution is heavily weighted toward **Medium** and **Hard** questions, which together constitute over 83% of the catalog. This suggests PayPal's interviews often involve complex problem-solving and optimization, requiring deep algorithmic understanding.

Expedia's profile is more approachable. With **54 total questions** (Easy: 13, Medium: 35, Hard: 6), the volume is roughly half of PayPal's. More importantly, the difficulty skews lighter. **Medium** questions are the core, but **Hard** problems are relatively rare, making up only about 11% of the total. This points to an interview process that may prioritize foundational competency and clean implementation over solving the most complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, creating a strong foundation for shared preparation.

**Core Shared Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are central to both. Mastering these is non-negotiable. A question like "Two Sum" is a classic example that could appear in either interview.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

**Key Differentiator:** The fourth most frequent topic reveals a divergence in focus.

- **PayPal** lists **Sorting**. This often implies questions involving custom comparators, merging intervals, or using sorting as a pre-processing step for more complex algorithms (e.g., "Merge Intervals," "Kth Largest Element").
- **Expedia** lists **Greedy**. This suggests a focus on problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global solution (e.g., "Maximum Subarray," "Jump Game," scheduling problems). While Sorting is a tool, Greedy represents a specific algorithmic paradigm.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target companies and timeline.

**Prepare for Expedia first if:** You are early in your interview prep cycle or prioritizing breadth. The smaller question count and lower proportion of Hard problems make it an achievable first milestone. Solidifying the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and practicing Greedy patterns will build a strong foundation that is also applicable to PayPal.

**Prepare for PayPal first if:** PayPal is your primary target, or you are aiming for a more rigorous practice session. Tackling PayPal's larger and more difficult set will force you to master Medium problems and confront challenging Hard scenarios. Success here will make Expedia's profile feel like a subset, significantly boosting your confidence. The Sorting focus requires practice with nuanced implementations.

A strategic hybrid approach is effective: **Start with the shared core.** Drill Array, String, and Hash Table problems to proficiency. Then, **branch based on your target**. If aiming for both, mastering PayPal's set is the more comprehensive strategy. Ensure you dedicate specific study to **Sorting algorithms** for PayPal and **Greedy problem patterns** for Expedia.
