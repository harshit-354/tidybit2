Zip’s technical interview is a focused assessment of practical coding and problem-solving skills, typically involving a series of algorithm and data structure questions. The process is designed to evaluate how you think through a problem, communicate your approach, and write clean, efficient code under time constraints. Understanding their specific focus areas is the fastest path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Zip’s recent interview questions reveals a clear pattern: **100% of their questions are rated at a Medium difficulty level**. There are no Easy or Hard questions in the sampled data. This is a critical insight. It means Zip is not testing basic syntax or obscure, complex algorithms. Instead, they are consistently evaluating a candidate's ability to solve non-trivial, real-world problems that require a solid grasp of core computer science concepts and clean implementation. You must be proficient at breaking down a moderately complex problem, selecting the appropriate data structure, and writing bug-free code efficiently. Mastery of Medium-level questions is non-negotiable.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five key topics. Prioritize these in your study.

- **Array:** Fundamental to most algorithms; expect questions involving traversal, sorting, or searching within a list of elements.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to data structure for achieving O(1) lookups and managing frequency counts; essential for optimizing solutions that involve matching or tracking elements.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array and Hash Table problems; focus on manipulation, subsequence checks, and palindrome validation.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Crucial for solving shortest path or level-order traversal problems in graphs and trees.
- **Greedy:** A problem-solving paradigm where locally optimal choices lead to a global solution; common in scheduling or interval problems.

The most powerful and frequently tested combination is **Hash Table with Arrays or Strings**. A quintessential pattern is using a hash map (dictionary) to track element frequencies to solve problems in O(n) time. This pattern is the cornerstone of many Medium-level questions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_majority_element(nums):
    """
    Returns the element appearing more than n/2 times.
    Demonstrates the frequency count pattern.
    """
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
        if count[num] > len(nums) // 2:
            return num
    return -1  # Should not be reached per problem constraints

# Example: find_majority_element([3,2,3]) returns 3
```

```javascript
function findMajorityElement(nums) {
  let count = new Map();
  for (let num of nums) {
    let currentCount = (count.get(num) || 0) + 1;
    count.set(num, currentCount);
    if (currentCount > nums.length / 2) {
      return num;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int findMajorityElement(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            int currentCount = count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1;
            count.put(num, currentCount);
            if (currentCount > nums.length / 2) {
                return num;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the 100% Medium focus, your plan must be intensive and targeted.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Deeply study the top five topics: Array, Hash Table, String, BFS, and Greedy. For each, learn the fundamental patterns (e.g., two-pointer for arrays, frequency map for hash tables, queue for BFS). Solve 15-20 curated Medium problems, ensuring you can implement standard patterns from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews**
Start solving mixed-topic Medium problems without knowing the category in advance. This simulates the real interview. Focus on problems that combine topics, like "String manipulation using a Hash Table." Begin doing timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes) focusing solely on Medium questions. Practice verbalizing your thought process aloud.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Refinement**
Dedicate this period almost exclusively to practicing Zip’s past interview questions. Platforms like TidyBit categorize these by company. Simulate the exact interview environment. Review your solutions: is your code clean? Did you handle edge cases? Could you explain the time/space complexity clearly? Fill any last gaps in your knowledge.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** From the moment you see the question, talk through your initial thoughts, potential approaches, trade-offs, and why you’re choosing one. Interviewers assess your problem-solving journey, not just the final code.
2.  **Optimize with the Right Data Structure:** The jump from a brute-force O(n²) solution to an optimal O(n) solution for a Medium problem almost always involves a Hash Table or a clever pointer technique. Your first question after understanding the problem should be, "Can a hash map help here?"
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code Immediately:** Don’t write pseudocode or messy code to clean up later. Write clean, well-named, and logically structured code from the first line. Include clear comments for complex logic. This demonstrates professionalism and saves time.
4.  **Validate with Edge Cases:** Before declaring your solution complete, systematically run through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicates. State these aloud and check if your code handles them. This shows thoroughness.

Success with Zip comes from consistent, focused practice on Medium-difficulty problems that blend core data structures. Master the patterns, communicate your logic, and write precise code.
