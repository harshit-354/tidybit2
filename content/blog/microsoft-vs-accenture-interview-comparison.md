When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Microsoft and Accenture, while both major technology employers, have distinct interview processes that reflect their different business models and engineering cultures. Microsoft, a product-based software giant, emphasizes deep algorithmic problem-solving for core engineering roles. Accenture, a global professional services and consulting firm, often focuses on practical, business-oriented coding challenges and problem-solving within project contexts. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear patterns in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions associated with each company is the most striking difference. Microsoft's tagged question bank is significantly larger, with **1,352 questions** compared to Accenture's **144 questions**. This disparity reflects Microsoft's long-standing prominence in the technical interview preparation space and the depth of its software engineering interviews.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty (762), with a substantial number of Easy (379) and a meaningful set of Hard (211) problems. This spread indicates that candidates must be prepared for a rigorous assessment of data structures and algorithms, with interviews often progressing to complex optimization challenges.
- **Accenture (E65/M68/H11):** The difficulty is heavily skewed towards Easy and Medium, with only 11 Hard questions. This suggests Accenture's technical screenings often prioritize foundational competency, clarity of thought, and the ability to implement working solutions over solving the most algorithmically intense problems. The focus is likely on practical application and logical reasoning.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize several core computer science fundamentals, but with different depths.

**Shared Core Topics:**

- **Array & String:** These are fundamental data structures tested by virtually all companies. You can expect problems involving traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation.
- **Hash Table:** Essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting problems. Mastery is non-negotiable for both.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Microsoft** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. The presence of 211 Hard questions strongly implies that advanced DP patterns (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, state machine DP) are fair game for many roles, especially for higher experience levels.
- **Accenture** lists **Math** as a primary topic instead of DP. This points to a higher likelihood of numerical problems, combinatorics, basic statistics, or bit manipulation—skills highly relevant to business logic and data analysis tasks common in consulting projects.

```python
# Example: A problem likely for both (Array/Hash Table)
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: A problem more likely for Microsoft (Dynamic Programming)
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

# Example: A problem more likely for Accenture (Math)
def countPrimes(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

```javascript
// Example: A problem likely for both (Array/Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: A problem more likely for Microsoft (Dynamic Programming)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];

      for (let j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
        isPrime[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return isPrime.filter((val) => val).length;

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Microsoft first** if you are aiming for roles at both companies. The reasoning is straightforward: preparing for Microsoft's interview covers Accenture's requirements, but not vice-versa.

Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) to a Medium/Hard level, with dedicated practice in Dynamic Programming, will build the algorithmic depth needed for Microsoft. This foundation will automatically make you over-prepared for the typical Accenture coding assessment, where you would then only need to lightly brush up on specific Math problems and potentially adjust your communication style to be more business-case oriented.

Starting with Accenture's question bank is less efficient. While it builds a solid base, it does not adequately prepare you for the harder Dynamic Programming and advanced algorithm questions prevalent at Microsoft. You would need a second, more intensive study period to bridge that gap.

In short, use Microsoft's question bank as your primary training ground for technical depth. Use Accenture's list for targeted practice on math-based problems and as a confidence-boosting final review.
