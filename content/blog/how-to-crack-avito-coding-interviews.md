Avito, Russia's largest classifieds platform, runs a rigorous technical interview process to find engineers who can build scalable systems and solve complex product problems. Their coding interviews typically focus on algorithmic problem-solving, reflecting the need to efficiently handle vast amounts of data and user interactions. Success requires a sharp, practical understanding of core computer science concepts applied to real-world scenarios.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of Avito's coding questions reveals a clear pattern: **67% are of Medium difficulty, and 33% are Easy. Hard problems are virtually absent.** This distribution is strategic. It assesses a candidate's foundational competency and ability to solve the kind of nuanced, multi-step problems that arise in daily development, rather than esoteric algorithm mastery. The absence of Hard problems means you should prioritize **consistent, bug-free execution on standard patterns** over grinding on the most complex puzzles. Your goal is to demonstrate you can reliably translate a common problem into clean, efficient code.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Depth in these areas is more valuable than breadth across every possible algorithm.

- **Array & Sorting:** The backbone of data manipulation. Expect problems involving searching, rearranging, or computing aggregates from lists of data. Mastering in-place operations and efficient sorts is key.
- **String:** Crucial for processing text, URLs, and user input. Focus on traversal, comparison, and pattern matching, often requiring careful index management.
- **Math:** Problems often involve number properties, modular arithmetic, or basic combinatorics. The challenge is usually in deriving the efficient formula, not in complex implementation.
- **Dynamic Programming:** The most advanced topic in their common set. Used for optimization problems (e.g., "find the longest/maximum/minimum way"). The core skill is identifying the overlapping subproblems and defining the state.

For Avito, the most important pattern to master is **Array manipulation combined with Sorting**. A frequent problem type is finding an optimal pair, triplet, or condition within an array, which often becomes trivial—or at least far more efficient—if the data is sorted first.

```python
# Example: Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target.
# Sorting enables a two-pointer O(n log n) solution.
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [nums[left], nums[right]]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Example usage:
# print(two_sum_sorted([3, 5, 1, 8, 2], 7)) # Output: [2, 5]
```

```javascript
// Example: Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target.
// Sorting enables a two-pointer O(n log n) solution.
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [nums[left], nums[right]];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(twoSumSorted([3, 5, 1, 8, 2], 7)); // Output: [2, 5]
```

```java
// Example: Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target.
// Sorting enables a two-pointer O(n log n) solution.
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (currentSum == target) {
                return new int[]{nums[left], nums[right]};
            } else if (currentSum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
// Example usage:
// Solution sol = new Solution();
// int[] result = sol.twoSumSorted(new int[]{3, 5, 1, 8, 2}, 7);
// System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [2, 5]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A focused, consistent approach is essential.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top four topics: Array, String, Sorting, and Math. Solve 15-20 problems for each, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Use a platform that categorizes problems by topic. The goal is to internalize the standard patterns and their implementations in your language of choice.

**Weeks 3-4: Dynamic Programming & Pattern Integration.** Spend the first week deeply on DP. Start with classic problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Knapsack) to understand memoization and tabulation. The second week should be for mixed-topic Medium problems. This simulates the real interview where you must diagnose which pattern applies.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Avito-Specific Practice.** Conduct at least 2-3 mock interviews per week, ideally with a peer or mentor. Practice communicating your thought process aloud from the moment you see the problem. In the final week, solve only problems tagged with "Avito" or from similar companies. Time yourself strictly (45 minutes per problem) to build stamina and accuracy under pressure.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Clarity, Then Speed:** Avito's Medium-heavy focus means a correct, readable solution is better than a rushed, buggy one. Write clean code with clear variable names first. Only discuss optimization (e.g., from O(n²) to O(n log n)) after your initial solution is solid.
2.  **Verbally Bridge the Gap:** Don't jump silently from problem statement to code. Explicitly state your reasoning: "This is a pairing problem, so sorting the array might help. I'll use a two-pointer approach to reduce the time complexity." This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through small, large, empty, and negative input cases. This shows professional discipline and often catches off-by-one errors.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language Inside Out:** Be prepared to discuss the time and space complexity of your language's built-in operations (e.g., `Arrays.sort()` in Java, `list.sort()` in Python). This is often a follow-up question.

Mastering these focused topics and strategies will position you strongly for Avito's coding interviews. The key is consistent, deliberate practice on the patterns they actually test.
