When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are prioritized. Uber and Samsung, while both testing core algorithms, present distinct challenges in volume, difficulty, and focus. Understanding these differences helps you allocate your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of Uber's question bank is its defining feature. With **381 questions** cataloged, it dwarfs Samsung's 69. This volume reflects Uber's intense, broad-scope interview process, which often includes multiple coding rounds.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **Uber (E54/M224/H103)**: Leans heavily toward **Medium** difficulty (224 questions, ~59%). Its Hard count (103 questions, ~27%) is significant, indicating you must be ready for complex optimization problems, especially in later rounds.
- **Samsung (E15/M37/H17)**: Has a more balanced spread relative to its size, with Medium (37 questions, ~54%) as the core. The absolute number of Hard problems (17) is far lower than Uber's.

**Key Takeaway**: Preparing for Uber is a marathon requiring deep, sustained practice across many problems. Samsung preparation is more of a targeted sprint, though its problems can still be challenging.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, but their applications differ.

- **Array & Hash Table**: Fundamental for both. Uber uses these extensively for real-world data processing (e.g., matching riders/drivers, geohashing). Samsung often applies them in simulation and matrix problems common in hardware/embedded contexts.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A critical common thread. Uber's DP questions often relate to optimization and system design (e.g., optimal pricing, route planning). Samsung's DP problems frequently involve pathfinding, resource allocation, or game theory in a grid.

- **String** algorithms are a major focus for Uber (reflecting text processing in apps and services) but less prominent for Samsung.
- **Two Pointers** is a key topic for Samsung, useful for efficient array traversal in constrained environments.

**Example: A Common "Array & DP" Problem**
Both companies might ask a problem like finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (Kadane's Algorithm), but with different twists.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Python - Kadane's Algorithm (Core)
def maxSubArray(nums):
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
    return global_max
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - Kadane's Algorithm (Core)
function maxSubArray(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0];
  let globalMax = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
    globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
  }
  return globalMax;
}
```

```java
// Java - Kadane's Algorithm (Core)
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int currentMax = nums[0];
    int globalMax = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
        globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
    }
    return globalMax;
}
```

</div>

An **Uber** follow-up might involve scaling this to a 2D matrix or connecting it to a real-time data stream. A **Samsung** variant could involve navigating a grid with obstacles or minimizing cost under specific memory constraints.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your priority depends on your target and timeline.

**Prepare for Uber first if:** You are interviewing at Uber, or your goal is a comprehensive skill build. Mastering Uber's vast question set will inherently cover nearly all of Samsung's core topics (Array, DP, Hash Table) and more. The depth required for Uber's Hard problems will make Samsung's Medium-tier questions feel more manageable. This is the broader, more foundational path.

**Prepare for Samsung first if:** You have an imminent Samsung interview or are building confidence. The smaller, focused question bank allows for thorough mastery in less time. You can drill into Array, DP, and Two Pointers patterns deeply without being overwhelmed by volume. This is an efficient, targeted strategy.

In practice, a strong candidate for either company must have **Array and Dynamic Programming** patterns solidly internalized. The difference lies in the breadth of additional topics (like String algorithms for Uber) and the stamina needed for longer problem sets.
