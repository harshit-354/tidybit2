Optiver’s coding interviews are a direct test of your ability to write clean, efficient, and correct code under pressure. As a leading market maker, they prioritize candidates who can think logically, handle edge cases, and implement solutions with optimal performance. The process typically involves one or more technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often with a low-latency mindset, before progressing to domain-specific and behavioral stages.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent patterns, Optiver's coding questions skew heavily towards foundational and applied problem-solving. The breakdown is clear: **Easy (33%)**, **Medium (67%)**, and **Hard (0%)**. This distribution is revealing.

The complete absence of "Hard" LeetCode-style problems indicates Optiver is less interested in esoteric algorithms and more in assessing core competency and coding precision. The two-thirds majority of Medium problems are the core of the interview. These questions often involve a twist on a standard pattern or require integrating multiple concepts. The Easy questions serve as warm-ups or checks for basic proficiency, but don't mistake their simplicity—they must be solved flawlessly and efficiently.

In short, your goal is to master fundamental data structures and algorithms to the point where you can solve Medium problems quickly and without bugs. Depth beats breadth here.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a practical toolkit for financial software: **Array**, **Linked List**, **Design**, **Dynamic Programming**, and **Hash Table**.

**Array:** Expect questions on in-place manipulations, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques. Master traversals and state management within a fixed sequence.

**Linked List:** Focus on pointer manipulation, cycle detection, and reversal patterns. These test your understanding of object references and edge cases (null pointers, single-node lists).

**Design:** This is critical. You might be asked to design a data structure (like an LRU Cache) or a simple system. Clarity in communication and justifying trade-offs is as important as the code.

**Dynamic Programming:** Problems often relate to optimization, pathfinding, or counting ways. Start with 1D and 2D DP patterns. The key is recognizing the subproblem and state definition.

**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, memoization in DP, or as a supporting structure in design questions.

For Optiver, the most synthetically important pattern is likely **Design**, as it combines data structure knowledge with practical implementation. The **LRU Cache** is a classic example that appears frequently.

            lru = self.left.next

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is essential.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill the top five topics. Solve 2-3 problems per topic daily, starting with Easy, then Medium. Use a timer. For each problem, implement the solution in your primary language, then analyze time/space complexity aloud. Key goal: internalize patterns like two-pointer (Array), fast/slow pointer (Linked List), and hash map usage.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Speed.** Focus exclusively on Medium problems that combine topics (e.g., Array + Hash Table, DP + Array). Practice explaining your thought process step-by-step before coding. Simulate interview conditions: 30 minutes per problem, no IDE, only a notepad. Revisit the LRU Cache and similar design problems until you can code them from scratch without hesitation.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Refinement.** Conduct at least 2-3 mock interviews per week, preferably with someone who can give critical feedback on your code clarity and problem-solving approach. Review any mistakes meticulously. In the final days, revisit all previously solved problems to ensure you understand them completely, not just memorized them.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness First.** Optiver values bug-free code. Write a simple, working solution before optimizing. Clearly state your complexity and any trade-offs.
2.  **Communicate Your Process.** Think out loud. Explain your brute-force idea, then your optimization. Interviewers assess your thought trajectory, not just the final answer.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases Explicitly.** Before coding, list potential edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Address them in your code and verbally confirm.
4.  **Practice Without an IDE.** Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code on a whiteboard or in a plain text editor. Missing a semicolon is a costly distraction.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before solving, ensure you understand the problem fully. Ask about input ranges, expected output for edge cases, and performance expectations.

Success in Optiver's interviews comes from disciplined practice on the right fundamentals. Build muscle memory for the core patterns, and you'll be able to focus on demonstrating clear, logical thinking during the interview.
