When preparing for technical interviews at top companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically increase your efficiency. Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce giant, and Morgan Stanley, a global investment bank, both demand strong algorithmic skills but show distinct patterns in their question selection. A direct comparison of their question banks—each containing 53 questions—reveals key differences in difficulty distribution and topic emphasis, guiding a more targeted preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Both companies have an identical total number of questions (53), but the distribution across difficulty levels is markedly different.

**Coupang's** breakdown is **14 Easy, 36 Medium, and 14 Hard** questions. This indicates a strong, balanced focus on Medium and Hard problems, with nearly 27% of the question bank being Hard. This skew towards challenging problems suggests Coupang's interviews are designed to rigorously test advanced problem-solving and optimization skills under pressure.

**Morgan Stanley's** breakdown is **13 Easy, 34 Medium, and 6 Hard** questions. While still Medium-heavy, the proportion of Hard questions is significantly lower at about 11%. This points to an interview process that deeply assesses core competency and clean implementation across fundamental topics, with less frequent use of the most complex algorithmic puzzles.

In short: Coupang's interview leans more challenging, while Morgan Stanley's emphasizes a strong grasp of fundamentals.

## Topic Overlap

The stated core topics for both companies are identical: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is substantial and provides a clear common foundation for preparation.

- **Array and String** manipulations form the bedrock of most questions. Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and matrix traversal.
- **Hash Table** is the go-to data structure for efficient lookups and is frequently combined with other patterns to achieve O(1) or O(n) time complexity.
- **Dynamic Programming** is a critical advanced topic. The difficulty difference is evident here; you're more likely to encounter multi-dimensional or highly optimized DP problems at Coupang.

While the core topics align, the application and depth will follow the difficulty trends. A Morgan Stanley question might use a hash table to solve a classic array problem, while a Coupang question might require combining a hash table with a monotonic stack or DFS for a more complex string manipulation.

**Example: Two Sum Problem (A classic Hash Table application)**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company whose style best matches your current skill level.

**Prepare for Morgan Stanley first if:** You are earlier in your interview preparation cycle or have interviews with both companies. Mastering the fundamental patterns within Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables through Medium-difficulty problems will build a robust foundation. This core knowledge is 100% transferable and will make tackling Coupang's harder problems more manageable. The lower volume of Hard questions allows you to build confidence efficiently.

**Prepare for Coupang first if:** Your primary goal is Coupang, or you are already very comfortable with standard Medium problems. You should allocate significant time to advanced Dynamic Programming variations, graph algorithms (which often accompany these core topics), and complex pointer manipulation. Practicing under a higher difficulty ceiling will make a Morgan Stanley interview feel more straightforward by comparison.

**Strategic Approach:** The high topic overlap means you are not choosing between two separate syllabi. Start with a solid pass through the common topics using Medium-difficulty problems. Then, based on your target company, branch out: for Morgan Stanley, ensure flawless execution on fundamentals; for Coupang, drill deeply into Hard problem variations of those same topics.
