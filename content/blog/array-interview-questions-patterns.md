Array questions are the bedrock of coding interviews. They test fundamental skills like iteration, indexing, and data manipulation, which are prerequisites for solving more complex problems involving trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. With over 1,600 questions tagged, arrays represent a core topic you must master. Success here isn't about memorizing solutions; it's about recognizing underlying patterns and applying systematic strategies.

## Common Patterns

Most array problems fall into a few reusable patterns. Learning these transforms a new problem into a variation of something you already know how to solve.

**1. Two Pointers**
This technique uses two indices to traverse the array, often from opposite ends or at different speeds. It's ideal for problems involving sorted arrays, pair sums, or in-place modifications.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left, right];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left, right};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

**2. Sliding Window**
Use a window (subarray) defined by two pointers that slides across the array to track a subset of data. Perfect for finding contiguous subarrays meeting a condition (e.g., maximum sum, shortest/longest length with a constraint).

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray_sum(nums, k):
    if len(nums) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSubarraySum(nums, k) {
  if (nums.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = nums.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

</div>

**3. Prefix Sum**
Pre-compute cumulative sums to answer range sum queries in constant time. This pattern is essential for problems involving subarray sums or needing frequent aggregate calculations.

**4. In-place Array Modification**
Manipulate the array within the given space, often using pointers to overwrite elements. Common in problems like removing duplicates, moving zeros, or applying cyclic sort for arrays with a known range.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a clear distribution: 21% Easy, 54% Medium, and 25% Hard. This split is strategic.

- **Easy (21%):** These test core syntax and basic operations—looping, accessing elements, simple conditionals. They are warm-ups and confidence builders. Expect them in early interview screens.
- **Medium (54%):** This is the battleground. Most onsite interview questions are Medium. They require combining patterns (e.g., Two Pointers within a Sliding Window) and handling edge cases. Mastering Medium problems is non-negotiable.
- **Hard (25%):** These problems often involve multiple advanced patterns, complex data structure combinations, or non-obvious optimizations. They are typical for senior roles or final-round interviews at top-tier companies.

## Which Companies Ask Array

Array questions are universal, but some companies emphasize them more heavily in their problem selection. The top askers include:

- [Google](/company/google)
- [Amazon](/company/amazon)
- [Meta](/company/meta)
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft)
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg)

At these companies, array problems frequently serve as the vehicle to test algorithmic thinking, even when the core concept is dynamic programming or a hash map.

## Study Tips

1.  **Patterns First, Problems Second.** Don't grind randomly. Identify the pattern for a problem before coding. If stuck, categorize it—is it a search, sort, subarray, or rearrangement problem? This directs your approach.
2.  **Draw It Out.** Before writing code, use a whiteboard or paper. Diagram the array, pointers, and how they move. This clarifies logic and catches edge cases (empty array, single element, negative numbers).
3.  **Master Time/Space Complexity Analysis.** For every solution, articulate the Big O. Interviewers expect you to justify your approach and discuss trade-offs. Can you solve it in O(n) time with O(1) space?
4.  **Practice In-place Operations.** Many interview constraints require O(1) extra space. Get comfortable with pointer manipulation that overwrites array indices without using a second array as a crutch.

Build fluency with these patterns and strategies to turn array problems from challenges into opportunities to demonstrate fundamental mastery.
