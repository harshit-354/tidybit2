Zynga’s coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving with an emphasis on clean, working code under time constraints. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you’ll be asked to solve algorithmic problems on a shared editor, followed by discussions about your approach and potential optimizations. The goal is to assess not just whether you can solve a problem, but how you think through edge cases and communicate your reasoning.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Zynga’s question distribution leans heavily towards foundational concepts. The breakdown is approximately 33% Easy and 67% Medium difficulty questions, with Hard problems being rare. This is a critical insight: Zynga prioritizes strong, bug-free implementation of core data structures and algorithms over solving esoteric, complex puzzles. The absence of Hard questions means your preparation should focus on mastery of Medium-level problems—ensuring you can solve them efficiently and explain your solution clearly. The expectation is to demonstrate fluency, not just familiarity.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Stack, Simulation, Linked List, and Recursion. You should be able to implement solutions using these structures without hesitation.

- **Array:** The most common data structure. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, two-pointer techniques, and sliding windows.
- **Stack:** Crucial for problems related to parsing, validation (like parentheses), and maintaining order. The LIFO property is often key to solving simulation problems.
- **Simulation:** This is a problem type where you must carefully model a process step-by-step. It tests your ability to translate rules into clean, iterative code without getting lost in complexity.
- **Linked List:** Focus on pointer manipulation, cycle detection, and reversal. These problems test your understanding of references and edge cases (like null pointers).
- **Recursion:** Often appears in tree/graph traversal or as a component in divide-and-conquer algorithms. You must be comfortable with base cases and the recursive leap of faith.

A quintessential Zynga pattern combining **Array** and **Stack** is the "Next Greater Element" problem. This tests your ability to use a stack to efficiently track elements in an array, a pattern applicable to many simulation-style questions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def nextGreaterElement(nums):
    """
    For each element in nums, find the next greater element.
    Returns a list of answers. Use -1 if no greater element exists.
    """
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # stores indices

    for i in range(n):
        # While current element is greater than the element at the index on top of stack
        while stack and nums[i] > nums[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            result[idx] = nums[i]
        stack.append(i)
    return result

# Example
print(nextGreaterElement([4, 5, 2, 10]))  # Output: [5, 10, 10, -1]
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // stores indices

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    while (stack.length > 0 && nums[i] > nums[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
      const idx = stack.pop();
      result[idx] = nums[i];
    }
    stack.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}

// Example
console.log(nextGreaterElement([4, 5, 2, 10])); // Output: [5, 10, 10, -1]
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    java.util.Stack<Integer> stack = new java.util.Stack<>();
    java.util.Arrays.fill(result, -1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[i] > nums[stack.peek()]) {
            int idx = stack.pop();
            result[idx] = nums[i];
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage would output: [5, 10, 10, -1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-based plan is more effective than random practice.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate 2-3 days to each of the top five topics (Array, Stack, Simulation, Linked List, Recursion). For each, solve 8-10 curated Easy and Medium problems. The goal is pattern recognition. Implement every solution from scratch.
- **Week 3: Integration.** Solve Medium problems that combine these topics. Examples: simulating a queue using stacks (Stack + Simulation), or recursively traversing a linked list (Recursion + Linked List). Practice explaining your code out loud as you write it.
- **Week 4: Mock Interviews & Review.** Conduct at least 3-5 timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes each) with a focus on Zynga’s difficulty profile (one Easy, two Mediums). Use platforms that provide Zynga-tagged questions. In the final days, re-solve problems you initially struggled with and solidify your understanding of the stack-based array pattern shown above.
- **Weeks 5-6 (if available): Polish.** Fill any remaining knowledge gaps. Practice writing syntactically perfect code quickly. Rehearse your problem-solving narrative: how you clarify constraints, choose an approach, and test with examples.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Running Code Over Optimal Code.** Given the difficulty spread, a correct, brute-force solution is often better than an incomplete optimal one. Get a working solution first, then optimize if time permits. Interviewers want to see you ship.
2.  **Verbally Simulate Your Code.** Before you start coding, walk through a small test case with your algorithm. This catches logical errors early and demonstrates structured thinking. For simulation problems, this step is non-negotiable.
3.  **Test Edge Cases Proactively.** After writing your code, don't wait for the interviewer to ask. Immediately test with empty input, single-element arrays, negative numbers, or already-sorted lists. State what you’re testing and why.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language's Collections API Cold.** Be able to instantiate and use stacks, arrays, and lists without looking up syntax. Hesitation here eats into your problem-solving time and creates a poor impression.

Mastering these core topics and demonstrating clear, iterative problem-solving will give you a significant advantage in a Zynga coding interview.
