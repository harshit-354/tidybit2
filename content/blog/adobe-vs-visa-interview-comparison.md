When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can dramatically improve your efficiency. Adobe and Visa, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a significant difference in the breadth of questions you might encounter.

**Adobe** has a larger, more challenging question bank with **227 total questions**, categorized as Easy (68), Medium (129), and Hard (30). This volume suggests a broader scope of potential problems and a heavier emphasis on the Medium difficulty tier, which is the core of most software engineering interviews. Preparing for Adobe means being ready to tackle a wide array of moderately complex algorithmic puzzles.

**Visa** presents a more focused set with **124 total questions**: Easy (32), Medium (72), and Hard (20). While still substantial, the nearly 50% smaller pool indicates a slightly more predictable interview loop. The difficulty distribution is similar in proportion to Adobe's, with Medium questions making up the majority (~58%). The lower absolute number, especially of Hard questions, can make targeted preparation more manageable.

```python
# Example of a common Medium-difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Adobe's focus might extend this to a "Two Pointers" variant on sorted data.
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target): # Two Pointers approach
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1] # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Two Pointers variant for sorted array
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Java: Two Sum (Hash Table)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}

// Two Pointers variant
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[] { left + 1, right + 1 };
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** fundamentals. These are the building blocks of data manipulation and lookup efficiency.

- **Adobe's** listed topics include **Two Pointers**. This is a critical pattern for solving problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or sliding windows (a subset of the two-pointer technique). The presence of this specific pattern suggests a strong focus on in-place array manipulation and optimization problems.

- **Visa's** listed topics include **Sorting**. While sorting is a fundamental concept used everywhere, its explicit mention alongside the core three hints at a particular interest in problems where the sorting step itself is key to the solution (e.g., meeting intervals, anagrams, or finding the Kth largest element). Many sorting-based solutions also use hash tables, creating a common problem archetype.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Visa-relevant pattern: Group Anagrams (Hash Table + Sorting)
def group_anagrams(strs):
    from collections import defaultdict
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        key = ''.join(sorted(s)) # Sorting the string is the key operation
        anagrams[key].append(s)
    return list(anagrams.values())
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: Group Anagrams
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const s of strs) {
    const key = s.split("").sort().join(""); // Sorting step
    if (!map.has(key)) map.set(key, []);
    map.get(key).push(s);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

```java
// Java: Group Anagrams
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars); // Sorting step
            String key = new String(chars);
            map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(key).add(s);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Visa**. Its more focused question set and the clear emphasis on Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting provide a strong, manageable foundation. Mastering these will cover a vast majority of Visa's problems and also build the essential core skills needed for any technical interview. The patterns you solidify here—especially efficient lookups with hash tables and sorting-based logic—are universally applicable.

After building that core competency, expand your preparation for **Adobe**. Adobe's larger question bank and the inclusion of the **Two Pointers** pattern require additional practice. You'll need to adapt your core knowledge to a wider variety of problems that often involve more complex in-place array/string manipulation. Preparing for Adobe effectively means taking your foundational skills and applying them to more intricate scenarios and a greater number of potential problems.

In short, a Visa-first approach allows you to build a robust algorithmic foundation efficiently. You can then layer on the additional patterns and breadth required to tackle Adobe's interview, making your overall preparation journey more structured and effective.
