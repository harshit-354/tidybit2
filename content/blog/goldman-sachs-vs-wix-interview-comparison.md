When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Goldman Sachs and Wix represent two distinct ends of the financial technology and web development spectrums, which is clearly reflected in their interview question profiles. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you prioritize and tailor your study approach effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Goldman Sachs maintains a significantly larger and more challenging question bank. With 270 total questions, the distribution is 51 Easy (E), 171 Medium (M), and 48 Hard (H). This high volume, coupled with a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems, indicates that interviewers expect candidates to handle complex problem-solving under pressure. Preparation must be extensive and depth-oriented.

Wix, in contrast, has a more focused question set of 56 total questions, distributed as 16 Easy, 31 Medium, and 9 Hard. While still challenging, the smaller pool and higher proportion of Easy/Medium questions suggest interviews may focus more on assessing solid foundational knowledge and practical coding ability rather than solving novel, highly complex algorithms.

```python
# Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# This is foundational for both companies.
```

```javascript
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies strongly emphasize **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These form the essential core of data structure manipulation and are non-negotiable areas to master. You must be proficient in techniques like two-pointers, sliding windows, and frequency counting.

The key differentiator is the secondary focus. Goldman Sachs lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a major topic. This aligns with the finance industry's need for optimization and efficient algorithm design. Expect problems involving sequences, paths, or resource allocation that require a DP approach.

Wix lists **Depth-First Search (DFS)** as a key topic instead. This reflects the company's web and product structure domain, where tree and graph traversal (e.g., navigating DOM trees, component hierarchies, or site maps) is highly relevant.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Goldman Sachs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

# Wix Focus: Depth-First Search (Tree Traversal)
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def dfs_inorder(node):
    if not node:
        return []
    return dfs_inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + dfs_inorder(node.right)
```

```javascript
// Goldman Sachs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Wix Focus: Depth-First Search (Tree Traversal)
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function dfsInorder(node) {
  if (!node) return [];
  return [...dfsInorder(node.left), node.val, ...dfsInorder(node.right)];
}
```

```java
// Goldman Sachs Focus: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Wix Focus: Depth-First Search (Tree Traversal)
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public List<Integer> dfsInorder(TreeNode node) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (node == null) return result;
    result.addAll(dfsInorder(node.left));
    result.add(node.val);
    result.addAll(dfsInorder(node.right));
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Goldman Sachs first** if you are interviewing with both. Its broader and deeper question bank forces a more rigorous and comprehensive study regimen. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) plus Dynamic Programming will build a strong algorithmic foundation. The skills required for Goldman Sachs—especially solving numerous Medium/Hard problems—will comfortably cover the core technical expectations for Wix.

If you are only targeting Wix, you can adopt a more focused strategy. Prioritize the core topics and ensure you are comfortable with tree/graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS. Practice explaining your reasoning clearly, as the interview may involve practical scenarios related to web structures.

In summary, use the Goldman Sachs question set for depth and breadth of practice, and the Wix set for targeted review of application-centric patterns like DFS.
