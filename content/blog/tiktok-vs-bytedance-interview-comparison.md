When preparing for interviews at TikTok or its parent company ByteDance, candidates often wonder how to prioritize their study. While both companies are part of the same corporate family, their public interview question profiles on platforms like LeetCode show distinct differences in volume and focus. Understanding these nuances is key to efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of documented questions. TikTok's profile lists **383 questions**, dwarfing ByteDance's **64**. This volume makes TikTok's question bank a more substantial resource for pattern recognition.

The difficulty distribution also varies:

- **TikTok (383q):** Easy: 42, Medium: 260, Hard: 81
- **ByteDance (64q):** Easy: 6, Medium: 49, Hard: 9

TikTok's distribution is heavily skewed towards **Medium** and **Hard** problems (89% combined), indicating their interviews frequently test complex problem-solving and optimization. ByteDance's set, while also Medium-heavy, has a slightly higher proportion of Easy questions and a lower proportion of Hards. This doesn't necessarily mean ByteDance interviews are easier—the smaller dataset may not be fully representative, or the company might rely more on proprietary questions not published on public platforms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize a nearly identical set of core data structures and algorithms, as seen in their top topics: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**.

This strong overlap means foundational preparation is universally applicable. Mastering array manipulation, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, hash map usage for lookups, and foundational DP patterns will serve you well for both.

The key implication is that depth in these areas is more valuable than breadth across many topics. For example, being highly proficient in solving a wide variety of String and DP problems is likely more beneficial than having superficial knowledge of graph algorithms.

**Example: A common two-pointer problem for arrays.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    insert_pos = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
            nums[insert_pos] = nums[i]
            insert_pos += 1
    return insert_pos
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let insertPos = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
      nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
      insertPos++;
    }
  }
  return insertPos;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int insertPos = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            nums[insertPos] = nums[i];
            insertPos++;
        }
    }
    return insertPos;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **TikTok's question list**. Its larger volume provides a broader exposure to the problem-solving patterns and difficulty level favored within the ByteDance ecosystem. Solving a significant portion of its 260 Medium problems will build the robust algorithmic muscle memory needed for both interviews.

After building that foundation, use **ByteDance's smaller question set** for targeted review and validation. Treat these 64 questions as a high-probability practice set. If you can comfortably solve most of them, it's a good sign your core skills are solid. The significant topic overlap means this preparation is not wasted; it directly applies.

In summary, prioritize the high-volume, high-difficulty TikTok list for comprehensive skill-building, then refine your approach with the ByteDance list. The shared focus on core data structures means deep, practical mastery of Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and DP will be your greatest asset.
