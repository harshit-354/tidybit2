LG Electronics coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving skills relevant to embedded systems, software development, and smart technology. The process typically involves one to two technical rounds assessing core data structures and algorithms, with an emphasis on writing clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints. The problems are designed to evaluate your fundamental programming ability and logical thinking.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: **0% Hard, 60% Medium, and 40% Easy** questions. This breakdown is critical for your strategy.

It means LG Electronics interviews are **fundamentals-forward**. You will not be expected to solve obscure, complex graph problems requiring advanced algorithms. Instead, the interviewers want to see mastery of core concepts. The 60% Medium questions are the gatekeepers—they separate candidates who can merely code from those who can design optimal solutions for common, real-world-adjacent problems. The 40% Easy questions ensure you have baseline competency and can handle straightforward logic without errors. Your goal is to ace the Mediums and execute the Easies flawlessly.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The top five topics—String, Two Pointers, Hash Table, Sorting, and Array—form a cohesive toolkit for solving most of their problems. Mastering the interplay between these topics is key.

- **String:** Often combined with Two Pointers or a Hash Table for validation, parsing, or comparison tasks. Focus on in-place manipulation and character counting.
- **Two Pointers:** A supremely efficient pattern for problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or finding pairs. It's your go-to for reducing O(n²) brute force to O(n).
- **Hash Table:** The ultimate tool for O(1) lookups. Use it to cache results (memoization), count frequencies, or check for duplicates instantly.
- **Sorting:** Frequently a preprocessing step that enables other techniques like Two Pointers or Binary Search. Know your language's built-in sort and its time complexity (O(n log n)).
- **Array:** The foundational data structure. Most problems will involve array traversal, sliding windows, or subarray calculations.

The most important combined pattern is **Two Pointers on a Sorted Array**, often using a Hash Table to avoid duplicates or store complements. Here is a classic example: finding all unique pairs that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_pairs(nums, target):
    nums.sort()  # Preprocessing step
    pairs = []
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            pairs.append([nums[left], nums[right]])
            # Move pointers past duplicates
            while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                left += 1
            while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                right -= 1
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return pairs
```

```javascript
function twoSumPairs(nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const pairs = [];
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      pairs.push([nums[left], nums[right]]);
      // Skip duplicates
      while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
      while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;
      left++;
      right--;
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return pairs;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public List<List<Integer>> twoSumPairs(int[] nums, int target) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    List<List<Integer>> pairs = new ArrayList<>();
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            pairs.add(Arrays.asList(nums[left], nums[right]));
            // Avoid duplicate pairs
            while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
            while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
            left++;
            right--;
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return pairs;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate one week to Arrays, Strings, and Sorting. The next week to Hash Tables and Two Pointers. For each topic, learn the theory, then solve 10-15 problems, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Focus on pattern recognition.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Practice.** Solve Medium-difficulty problems that combine the top topics (e.g., a String problem using a Hash Table and Two Pointers). Complete at least 30-40 such problems. Begin timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem).

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Review.** Simulate the real interview environment. Do 2-3 mock interviews per week using LG's question patterns. In your final week, stop learning new topics. Re-solve your past mistakes and solidify your understanding of core patterns. Practice explaining your code out loud.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Readability First:** LG values clean, maintainable code. Write clear variable names, use helper functions for complex logic, and add concise comments. A readable, correct solution is better than a cryptic, "optimal" one with bugs.
2.  **Always Discuss Edge Cases:** Before you start coding, verbally confirm edge cases with your interviewer. For String/Array problems, this includes empty input, single elements, large values, and duplicates. Proactively addressing these shows systematic thinking.
3.  **Start with a Brute Force:** If the optimal solution isn't immediate, state the obvious O(n²) approach first. Then, explain how you can optimize it, often by applying a Hash Table (for lookups) or Sorting + Two Pointers (for pair problems). This demonstrates a logical progression.
4.  **Test with Your Own Examples:** After writing your code, don't just declare it done. Walk through a standard case and at least one edge case with sample input. This catches off-by-one errors and incorrect loop conditions.

Mastering these core topics and strategies will prepare you effectively for the LG Electronics coding interview. The focus is on demonstrating strong fundamentals, clean code, and logical problem-solving—all skills essential for a developer in their ecosystem.
