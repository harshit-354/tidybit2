When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Google and eBay, while both tech giants, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of scale, difficulty, and focus. Google's process is famously comprehensive and algorithm-heavy, while eBay's tends to be more focused on practical, data-centric problems. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is sheer volume. On TidyBit, Google's tagged question bank is vastly larger (**2217 questions**) compared to eBay's (**60 questions**). This reflects Google's broader range of products, larger hiring scale, and the extensive historical data available from candidates.

The difficulty distribution also highlights different hiring bars:

- **Google (E588/M1153/H476)**: The difficulty spread is a classic bell curve centered on **Medium**. This is the core of a Google interview—complex problems requiring optimal solutions under pressure. The significant number of Hard questions (476) means you must be prepared for multi-layered algorithmic challenges.
- **eBay (E12/M38/H10)**: The distribution is also Medium-weighted, but the total count is low. The emphasis is strongly on **Medium** difficulty. The small number of Hard questions (10) suggests that while challenging problems can appear, the interview is less likely to delve into the most extreme algorithmic puzzles compared to Google.

```python
# Example of a classic Medium-difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
# Common at both companies, but a staple in Google's vast Medium set.
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    from collections import defaultdict
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        key = ''.join(sorted(s))
        anagram_map[key].append(s)
    return list(anagram_map.values())
```

```javascript
// Example of a classic Medium-difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const s of strs) {
    const key = s.split("").sort().join("");
    if (!map.has(key)) map.set(key, []);
    map.get(key).push(s);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

```java
// Example of a classic Medium-difficulty problem: Group Anagrams
public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
    Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (String s : strs) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        String key = new String(chars);
        map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
        map.get(key).add(s);
    }
    return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. This is the foundational toolkit for data manipulation and is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator is the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Google: Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The high frequency of DP questions aligns with Google's emphasis on advanced algorithmic optimization and recursive problem-solving. Mastering DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, state machines) is critical.
- **eBay: Sorting**. eBay's focus on Sorting over DP points to a more practical, data-processing oriented interview. Expect problems involving merging, searching, and organizing datasets efficiently. While DP may appear, it's less of a core requirement.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Google-favored: DP (Climbing Stairs - a foundational pattern)
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

# eBay-favored: Sorting (Merge Intervals - organizing data)
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
// Google-favored: DP (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// eBay-favored: Sorting (Merge Intervals)
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (!merged.length || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// Google-favored: DP (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n+1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// eBay-favored: Sorting (Merge Intervals)
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.get(merged.size()-1)[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.get(merged.size()-1)[1] = Math.max(merged.get(merged.size()-1)[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **eBay first**. Its focused question bank (60 questions) and strong emphasis on core data structures (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting) make it an excellent training ground. You can build a solid foundation and practice the most common patterns without being overwhelmed. Success here validates your core algorithmic skills.

Once that foundation is strong, transition to **Google**. Treat it as an advanced extension. You will need to drill deeply into Dynamic Programming, graph algorithms, and system design, while also practicing the sheer volume and complexity of problems. Google preparation will cover all the fundamentals tested at eBay and then push far beyond them.

In short: Use eBay's scope to build your core competency. Use Google's depth to achieve mastery.
