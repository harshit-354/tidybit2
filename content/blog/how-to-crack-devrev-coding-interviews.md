DevRev’s coding interviews are known for their intense focus on algorithmic problem-solving and data structure mastery. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you’ll be expected to write clean, efficient code under time pressure, often on a collaborative online editor. Success hinges on not just solving problems, but demonstrating optimal approaches and clear communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, DevRev’s question distribution is weighted heavily toward advanced challenges. Expect roughly one easy question (25%), one medium question (25%), and two hard questions (50%). This breakdown is critical: it signals that simply handling common mediums is insufficient. The interview is designed to push you. The two hard problems will likely require combining multiple concepts or implementing a non-trivial algorithm. Your performance on these will likely be the deciding factor. This distribution means your preparation must prioritize depth over breadth, ensuring you can navigate complex problem statements and derive optimal solutions under pressure.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a cohesive set for solving problems involving sequences, frequencies, and relationships.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Master in-place operations, two-pointer techniques, and prefix sums.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for counting, frequency mapping, and caching intermediate results (memoization).
- **Counting:** Often paired with Hash Tables. Central to problems about anagrams, duplicates, or majority elements.
- **Stack:** Crucial for parsing, backtracking, and maintaining state. Key for problems with nested structures or "next greater element" patterns.
- **Monotonic Stack:** A specialized stack where elements are kept in a specific order (monotonically increasing or decreasing). This is arguably the most important advanced pattern for DevRev interviews, as it provides an elegant O(n) solution for a class of problems involving finding the next/previous greater/smaller element.

The **Monotonic Stack** pattern is a standout. It maintains a stack where elements are ordered (e.g., decreasing). As you iterate through an array, you pop from the stack while the current element violates the order, which is precisely when you find the "next greater" element for the popped item. This transforms a naive O(n²) search into O(n).

<div class="code-group">

```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # Monotonic stack storing indices

    for i in range(n * 2):  # Handle circular array
        num = nums[i % n]
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < num:
            idx = stack.pop()
            result[idx] = num
        if i < n:
            stack.append(i)
    return result

# Example: nums = [3, 8, 4, 1, 2]
# Output: [8, -1, -1, 2, 3]
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // Monotonic stack storing indices

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    // Handle circular array
    const num = nums[i % n];
    while (stack.length && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < num) {
      const idx = stack.pop();
      result[idx] = num;
    }
    if (i < n) {
      stack.push(i);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Monotonic stack storing indices

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) { // Handle circular array
        int num = nums[i % n];
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < num) {
            int idx = stack.pop();
            result[idx] = num;
        }
        if (i < n) {
            stack.push(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the high density of hard problems, a superficial review won't work. Follow this intensive plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Solidify Array, Hash Table, and Stack. Solve 30-40 problems, focusing on mediums. Ensure you can implement two-pointer, sliding window, and basic stack operations without hesitation. Use a platform that tracks your time and space complexity.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Hard Problems.** Dedicate this block to mastering Monotonic Stack and tackling hard problems. Solve every Monotonic Stack problem you can find. Then, start integrating hard problems from the core topics. Aim for 15-20 hard problems in this period. Don't just solve—analyze why the optimal solution works and how you could have derived it.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Practice & Mock Interviews.** In the final stretch, solve problems tagged with DevRev or from similar companies. Simulate the actual interview: set a 45-minute timer for two problems (one medium, one hard). Practice verbalizing your thought process aloud. Get a peer to mock interview you, focusing on clarity and interaction.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Outline your approach, discuss trade-offs between brute force and optimal solutions, and state your complexity analysis. This turns a silent coding session into a collaborative problem-solving demonstration.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First, Then Optimization.** For a hard problem, a working brute-force solution is better than no solution. Clearly state it, then iterate. Say, "This is O(n²). I think we can improve using a monotonic stack to get O(n)."
3.  **Test Your Code with Edge Cases.** Before declaring done, run through small, empty, large, and sorted/reversed inputs. Verbally walk through the logic. This catches off-by-one errors and shows thoroughness.
4.  **If Stuck, Use a Concrete Example.** For abstract problems, write out a small sample array and manipulate it step-by-step. This often reveals the pattern needed for the stack or hash map.

Mastering these patterns and approaching the interview with a structured, communicative mindset will give you the best chance to succeed in DevRev's challenging technical screen.
