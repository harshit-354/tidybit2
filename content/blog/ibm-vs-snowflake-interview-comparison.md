When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. IBM and Snowflake, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topic emphasis. A targeted approach, informed by their recent question patterns, is more effective than generic study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

IBM's recent question pool is significantly larger and leans more towards foundational problems. With approximately 170 questions categorized as Easy (52), Medium (102), and Hard (16), the distribution suggests a strong emphasis on core competency assessment through medium-difficulty problems. The relatively low proportion of Hard questions indicates that interviews may prioritize clean, correct solutions to standard problems over highly optimized solutions to obscure challenges.

Snowflake's dataset, with about 104 questions, is more concentrated. Its distribution—Easy (12), Medium (66), Hard (26)—reveals a different strategy. The medium difficulty remains the largest category, but the proportion of Hard questions is notably higher than at IBM. This suggests Snowflake's process may include at least one problem designed to test the limits of a candidate's problem-solving and optimization skills under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, making these universal starting points for preparation.

IBM's listed topics—Array, String, Two Pointers, Sorting—point towards a focus on linear data structures and fundamental algorithms. Questions often involve in-place manipulation, searching, and ordering of data. Mastering two-pointer techniques for problems like removing duplicates or finding a target sum is crucial.

```python
# IBM-style Two Pointer: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read-1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// IBM-style Two Pointer: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// IBM-style Two Pointer: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

Snowflake's key topics include **Array**, **String**, **Hash Table**, and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The inclusion of Hash Table and DFS signals a shift towards problems involving efficient lookups, frequency counting, and graph/tree traversal—common in data-intensive and systems-oriented contexts. You must be comfortable using hash maps for optimization and implementing recursive or iterative DFS.

```python
# Snowflake-style DFS: Clone a Graph (simplified Node class)
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def cloneGraph(node):
    if not node:
        return None
    visited = {}

    def dfs(original):
        if original in visited:
            return visited[original]
        clone = Node(original.val)
        visited[original] = clone
        for neighbor in original.neighbors:
            clone.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
        return clone

    return dfs(node)
```

```javascript
// Snowflake-style DFS: Clone a Graph (simplified Node class)
function Node(val, neighbors) {
  this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
  this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors;
}

function cloneGraph(node) {
  if (!node) return null;
  const visited = new Map();

  function dfs(original) {
    if (visited.has(original)) return visited.get(original);
    const clone = new Node(original.val);
    visited.set(original, clone);
    for (let neighbor of original.neighbors) {
      clone.neighbors.push(dfs(neighbor));
    }
    return clone;
  }
  return dfs(node);
}
```

```java
// Snowflake-style DFS: Clone a Graph (simplified Node class)
import java.util.*;
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
        return dfs(node, visited);
    }

    private Node dfs(Node original, Map<Node, Node> visited) {
        if (visited.containsKey(original)) return visited.get(original);
        Node clone = new Node(original.val);
        visited.put(original, clone);
        for (Node neighbor : original.neighbors) {
            clone.neighbors.add(dfs(neighbor, visited));
        }
        return clone;
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **IBM first** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. Its larger set of predominantly medium-difficulty questions on fundamental topics provides a comprehensive workout for core algorithmic thinking. Solving these will build a solid foundation that is directly applicable to a wide range of companies, including Snowflake.

Shift focus to **Snowflake** after you are confident with arrays, strings, and basic two-pointer/sorting patterns. The preparation pivot involves deepening your knowledge of hash table applications (e.g., for memoization or frequency maps) and mastering graph traversal algorithms like DFS. The higher density of Hard problems requires practicing more complex optimization and edge-case handling.

Ultimately, IBM's pattern offers a broader foundational drill, while Snowflake's demands deeper dives into specific advanced topics. Strengthening your fundamentals with IBM-style questions will make tackling Snowflake's more specialized and difficult problems significantly more manageable.
