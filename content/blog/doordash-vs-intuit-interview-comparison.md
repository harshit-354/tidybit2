When preparing for technical interviews at DoorDash and Intuit, understanding the distinct patterns in their question banks is crucial for efficient study. While both companies test core computer science fundamentals, their emphasis on difficulty levels and specific topics differs significantly, reflecting their unique engineering challenges. DoorDash, a logistics platform, focuses heavily on problems involving graphs, state, and real-time optimization. Intuit, a financial software company, emphasizes data processing, reliability, and dynamic programming for complex calculations. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

DoorDash's list contains **87 questions**, with a difficulty distribution of **Easy: 6, Medium: 51, Hard: 30**. This profile is notable for its high concentration of Medium and Hard problems. The substantial number of Hard questions (over 34% of the total) indicates that DoorDash interviews frequently involve complex algorithmic challenges, often requiring multi-step reasoning, optimization, or sophisticated data structure manipulation. You must be comfortable with problems that extend beyond textbook examples.

Intuit's list is smaller at **71 questions**, with a markedly different distribution: **Easy: 10, Medium: 47, Hard: 14**. While Medium problems still dominate, the proportion of Hard questions is roughly half that of DoorDash's (about 20% vs. 34%). The presence of more Easy questions suggests Intuit may include more straightforward problems to assess coding fluency and basic problem-solving early in the process. The overall volume and lower density of Hard problems might indicate a slightly more accessible, though still rigorous, interview loop focused on robust and correct solutions.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** operations. These form the essential toolkit for any interview.

**DoorDash's** standout topic is **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, which appears in its top four. This aligns with its domain—modeling maps, delivery routes, and state spaces often involves graph traversal (DFS/BFS), tree problems, backtracking, and recursion. You can expect scenarios involving paths, dependencies, or permutations.

**Intuit's** defining topic is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, also in its top four. This reflects financial and tax software logic, where problems involve optimal computation, maximizing or minimizing values over sequences (like transactions or deductions), and solving overlapping subproblems. Mastery of classic DP patterns is critical.

Consider this classic problem often associated with each company's focus:

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Intuit first** if you are early in your interview preparation cycle. Its question list is smaller and has a lower proportion of Hard problems. Mastering the core Array, String, Hash Table, and especially Dynamic Programming patterns for Intuit will build a strong foundation. This core competency directly transfers to the majority of DoorDash's Medium problems.

Then, transition to **DoorDash preparation**. Use the established core skills and add dedicated, deep practice on graph traversal (DFS/BFS), recursion, backtracking, and more complex system design or optimization problems. The high volume of Hard questions requires you to be adept at breaking down non-trivial scenarios and writing bug-free code under pressure.

In summary, Intuit's list is a more focused foundation builder, while DoorDash's requires advanced application of those fundamentals to harder, often graph-based, problems. Target your study accordingly.
