When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and Yandex represent two distinct tech landscapes—global IT services and Russian tech giant—yet their coding interview questions reveal significant similarities in core focus areas, with notable differences in volume and difficulty distribution. A direct comparison of their question banks helps candidates prioritize their preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

TCS maintains a substantially larger public question bank with **217 questions** compared to Yandex's **134 questions**. This volume suggests TCS interviews may draw from a wider pool of problems or that their question repository is more extensively documented.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **TCS:** 94 Easy (43%), 103 Medium (47%), 20 Hard (9%)
- **Yandex:** 52 Easy (39%), 72 Medium (54%), 10 Hard (7%)

TCS has a slightly higher proportion of Easy questions, while Yandex leans more toward Medium-difficulty problems. Both keep Hard questions to a minor portion of their total, indicating interviews primarily test solid fundamentals and applied problem-solving rather than obscure algorithmic mastery.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies concentrate heavily on the same four fundamental data structures and techniques, which should form the bedrock of your preparation:

1.  **Array:** Manipulation, searching, and sorting are universal.
2.  **Hash Table:** Used for efficient lookups and frequency counting.
3.  **String:** Pattern matching and transformation are common.
4.  **Two Pointers:** Essential for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists.

The high overlap means mastering these topics prepares you for both. A problem like "Two Sum" is classic for both companies.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

Given the shared emphasis, depth in these areas is more valuable than breadth across many topics. Practice variations within them, such as sliding window (a two-pointer variant) for strings or arrays.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Yandex**. Its smaller, more medium-weighted question bank allows you to build core competency efficiently. Solving Yandex's ~134 problems, with focus on the Medium tier, will solidify the essential patterns. This foundation directly translates to a large portion of the TCS question pool.

Once comfortable with Yandex's problems, transition to **TCS**. Use the larger TCS bank to broaden your exposure within the same core topics. The additional Easy questions can reinforce basics, while the extra Medium and Hard problems will test your adaptability and deepen your understanding. This sequential approach prevents being overwhelmed by TCS's volume upfront.

In summary, prioritize depth in Array, Hash Table, String, and Two Pointers. Prepare with Yandex first to build a strong, efficient foundation, then use TCS's extensive list for reinforcement and challenge.
