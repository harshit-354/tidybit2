When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Infosys and JPMorgan Chase (JPMorgan) represent two distinct sectors—global IT services and top-tier finance—and their interview question profiles reflect this difference. A direct comparison of their tagged questions on TidyBit reveals clear patterns in volume, difficulty, and core topics, allowing you to tailor your study plan strategically.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant disparity in the sheer number of questions associated with each company. Infosys has a larger question bank with **158 questions**, while JPMorgan has a more focused set of **78 questions**.

The difficulty distribution is more revealing:

- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The difficulty curve is weighted towards **Medium** questions, which form the majority. The presence of a substantial number of **Hard** questions (34) indicates that Infosys interviews can delve into complex algorithmic problem-solving.
- **JPMorgan (E25/M45/H8):** The profile is heavily skewed towards **Easy** and **Medium** questions, with only a handful of **Hard** problems. This suggests JPMorgan's technical screening often emphasizes foundational correctness, clean code, and problem-solving approach over highly optimized, complex algorithms.

This difference highlights that while both require strong fundamentals, Infosys interviews are more likely to test the upper bounds of algorithmic mastery.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, making these the highest-yield topics to master first.

**Shared Core Topics:**

- **Array:** Fundamental for indexing, searching, and sorting operations.
- **String:** Common for parsing, validation, and pattern-matching questions.

**Diverging Focus:**

- **Infosys** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Math** as key topics. DP questions are classic for testing optimal substructure and memoization, often appearing in Medium and Hard difficulty.
- **JPMorgan** emphasizes **Hash Table** and **Sorting**. This aligns with financial data processing, where efficient lookups (Hash Table) and organizing datasets (Sorting) are daily tasks.

Here is a typical question that could appear at either company, solved using a hash table for efficiency:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target sector and the foundational strength required.

**Prepare for JPMorgan first if:** You are aiming for finance or fintech roles, or if you are early in your interview prep journey. The focus on Easy/Medium Array, String, and Hash Table problems provides a solid, manageable foundation. Mastering these will build confidence and cover a high percentage of their question bank efficiently.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are targeting core software engineering or IT services roles, or if you need to push your algorithmic skills to a higher level. The broader question set and the significant number of Medium/Hard problems, especially in Dynamic Programming, will force a deeper understanding. Successfully preparing for Infosys will inherently cover the difficulty level needed for JPMorgan's technical screen.

In practice, start with the shared core of **Array and String** problems. Then, branch based on your target: integrate **Hash Table and Sorting** practice for finance, or dive into **Dynamic Programming and Math** for IT services.
