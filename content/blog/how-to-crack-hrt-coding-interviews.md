Getting into Hudson River Trading (HRT) is one of the most challenging technical feats in finance. Their coding interviews are notoriously difficult, designed to filter for exceptional problem-solving speed, algorithmic depth, and flawless implementation under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds of intense, algorithm-focused coding on platforms like CoderPad, with a strong emphasis on optimal solutions and clean code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent HRT coding questions reveals a stark profile: **8 questions. Easy: 4 (50%), Medium: 1 (13%), Hard: 3 (38%).**

This distribution is deceptive. The high percentage of "Easy" questions does not mean simple problems. At HRT, "Easy" often translates to fundamental algorithms that must be implemented perfectly, efficiently, and with edge cases fully handled—often under extreme time constraints. The mere 13% Medium indicates they rarely ask moderate problems; they jump from testing core fundamentals to high-complexity challenges. The critical 38% Hard is the true gatekeeper. These questions are where candidates are separated, requiring deep insights into advanced data structures and algorithmic paradigms. Success requires not just solving the Hard problems, but breezing through the "Easy" ones to conserve time and mental energy for them.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a clear set of priority areas. Master these concepts in depth.

**Graph Theory (Top Priority)**
This is HRT's most frequent advanced topic. You must have instant recall of traversal (BFS/DFS), shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), and cycle detection algorithms. Union-Find is essential for dynamic connectivity problems.

**Array**
Expect problems involving in-place manipulations, subarray computations (Kadane's algorithm), and sorting/partitioning logic. Efficiency and careful index management are key.

**Math**
Problems often involve number theory (gcd, modulo), combinatorics, or geometric calculations. Look for patterns to avoid brute-force solutions.

**Greedy**
Recognizing when a locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum is a valued skill. These problems often combine with sorting or priority queues.

**Hash Table**
The fundamental tool for achieving O(1) lookups. Used for frequency counting, memoization, and as a building block in more complex systems.

Here is a critical Graph Theory pattern: **Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**. You will likely need to adapt this to a grid or a novel graph representation.

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # graph: adjacency list dict {node: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}
    min_dist = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    min_dist[start] = 0
    min_heap = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while min_heap:
        current_dist, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if current_dist > min_dist[node]:
            continue  # Skip stale entries
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            distance = current_dist + weight
            if distance < min_dist[neighbor]:
                min_dist[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, neighbor))
    return min_dist
```

```javascript
function dijkstra(graph, start) {
  // graph: adjacency list Map {node: [[neighbor, weight], ...]}
  const minDist = new Map();
  const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: (elem) => elem[0] });
  minDist.set(start, 0);
  minHeap.enqueue([0, start]);

  while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
    const [currentDist, node] = minHeap.dequeue().element;
    if (currentDist > (minDist.get(node) || Infinity)) continue;
    for (const [neighbor, weight] of graph.get(node) || []) {
      const distance = currentDist + weight;
      if (distance < (minDist.get(neighbor) || Infinity)) {
        minDist.set(neighbor, distance);
        minHeap.enqueue([distance, neighbor]);
      }
    }
  }
  return minDist;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Dijkstra {
    public Map<Integer, Integer> dijkstra(Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph, int start) {
        // graph: adjacency list {node: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}
        Map<Integer, Integer> minDist = new HashMap<>();
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        minDist.put(start, 0);
        minHeap.offer(new int[]{0, start});

        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = minHeap.poll();
            int currDist = current[0];
            int node = current[1];
            if (currDist > minDist.getOrDefault(node, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) continue;
            for (int[] edge : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
                int neighbor = edge[0], weight = edge[1];
                int distance = currDist + weight;
                if (distance < minDist.getOrDefault(neighbor, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
                    minDist.put(neighbor, distance);
                    minHeap.offer(new int[]{distance, neighbor});
                }
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Grind Array, Hash Table, and Math problems tagged "Easy" and "Medium" on platforms like TidyBit. Aim for speed and 100% correctness. Implement all basic data structures from scratch (Linked List, Hash Map, Priority Queue). Dedicate time to Graph Theory fundamentals: write BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra from memory daily.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Depth**
Focus exclusively on Graph Theory (Hard problems) and Greedy algorithms. Solve at least 2-3 Hard problems per day. Understand the derivation and proof of key algorithms. Practice adapting Dijkstra and Union-Find to non-standard problems (e.g., on a 2D grid with movement costs).

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Integration**
Conduct daily mock interviews under strict timing (45 minutes). Prioritize HRT-specific and finance-adjacent problems. The goal is not just to solve, but to produce production-ready code on the first try—clean, commented, with explicit edge case handling. Review every mistake meticulously.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize Your First Minute.** Read the problem, ask one clarifying question, and immediately articulate the brute-force approach and your planned optimal approach. This structured start is valued.
2.  **Code Flawlessly.** Syntax errors, off-by-one mistakes, or infinite loops are often fatal. Practice until your code runs correctly on the first compilation or execution for fundamental algorithms.
3.  **Master Time-Space Trade-Offs.** Be prepared to explain the Big O of every part of your solution and justify your chosen data structure. For HRT, the optimal asymptotic complexity is usually the minimum bar.
4.  **Practice Under Fatigue.** Do your hardest practice sessions when you're tired. The real interview will be at the end of a long, stressful day of other rounds.

Cracking HRT's coding interview is a test of precision, speed, and depth. Focus on the fundamentals until they are automatic, then drill into graph and optimization problems until you can see the solution path within seconds. The margin for error is virtually zero.
