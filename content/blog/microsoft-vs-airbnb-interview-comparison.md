When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Microsoft and Airbnb represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of question volume and focus, despite sharing significant overlap in their core technical topics. Microsoft's massive, well-documented question pool tests breadth and foundational mastery, while Airbnb's smaller, curated set often emphasizes practical, integrated problem-solving relevant to their business domain.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark difference in scale. Microsoft has **1,352** documented questions, dwarfing Airbnb's **64**. This volume makes Microsoft's question bank one of the largest and most comprehensive, effectively serving as a general-purpose algorithm study guide.

Breaking down by difficulty:

- **Microsoft:** Easy 379, Medium 762, Hard 211. The distribution is heavily weighted toward Medium problems, indicating an interview loop focused on solid algorithmic competency and problem-solving under pressure.
- **Airbnb:** Easy 11, Medium 34, Hard 19. The proportion of Hard problems is significantly higher (~30% vs. ~16% at Microsoft), suggesting their fewer questions may delve into more complex scenarios or require multi-step solutions.

This means preparing for Microsoft requires stamina and coverage—you must be ready for anything from their vast pool. Preparing for Airbnb requires depth and precision—mastering their more selective, often tougher, problem set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize the same four core data structures and algorithms: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This is the essential toolkit for modern software engineering interviews.

The key difference lies in application. Microsoft questions on these topics are often classic, discrete algorithm challenges. An Array problem might be a pure rotation or search challenge. A Dynamic Programming problem is likely a standard formulation.

Airbnb, given its domain in travel and rentals, may frame problems with more real-world context. A String problem could involve parsing or validating listing descriptions or date formats. A Hash Table and Array combination might be used for designing a booking system component. The underlying algorithm is the same, but the presentation may feel more applied.

For example, a problem involving merging intervals (a common Array/Sorting topic) could appear at both:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Classic "Merge Intervals" - common at Microsoft
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
// Classic "Merge Intervals"
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// Classic "Merge Intervals"
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

</div>

At Airbnb, this might be embedded in a problem about merging overlapping booking periods.

## Which to Prepare for First

**Prepare for Microsoft first if you are early in your interview journey.** Its enormous question bank aligns closely with the standard LeetCode curriculum. Mastering a broad set of Microsoft-style problems will build the foundational skills that are directly transferable to Airbnb and most other companies. It ensures you cover the essential patterns in Array, String, Hash Table, and DP comprehensively.

**Shift to Airbnb preparation once your fundamentals are solid.** Their limited question count allows for targeted, deep practice. You can thoroughly solve all their documented problems, often more than once, and research the specific problem narratives and follow-up questions common in their interviews. The higher proportion of Hard problems means you should focus on clean, optimal solutions for complex tasks.

In essence, Microsoft preparation is about building a wide, strong foundation. Airbnb preparation is about specializing and polishing. A strategy of studying Microsoft's patterns first, then drilling into Airbnb's specific list, is highly efficient.
