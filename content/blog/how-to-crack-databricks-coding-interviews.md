Databricks coding interviews test your ability to solve complex data processing and system design problems under pressure. The process typically involves 1-2 technical phone screens focusing on algorithms and data structures, followed by a virtual onsite with 3-4 rounds. These rounds often blend coding with system design, especially for senior roles, reflecting the company's work with large-scale data analytics and distributed systems. Success requires targeted preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 31 recent Databricks coding questions reveals a clear, challenging profile: only 1 question (3%) is Easy, 23 (74%) are Medium, and 7 (23%) are Hard. This distribution is telling. You will not be asked trivial problems. The interview is designed to assess how you handle substantial, real-world coding challenges. The high concentration of Medium-difficulty questions means you must be exceptionally proficient with core algorithms and patterns—solving them correctly, efficiently, and under time constraints. The significant Hard component, nearly a quarter of questions, indicates they are probing for deep problem-solving skills, often involving optimization, advanced data structures, or multi-step logic. Expect to be pushed beyond the basics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows where to direct your energy. Master these five areas, which cover the vast majority of problems.

- **Array (and Matrix):** Fundamental to almost all data manipulation. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations. Matrix problems often involve 2D traversal, rotation, or search in a sorted 2D array.
- **String:** Closely tied to array problems, with added complexity from palindromes, anagrams, and substring searches. Efficient string building and manipulation is key.
- **Hash Table:** The most critical tool for achieving O(1) lookups and solving problems involving frequency counts, deduplication, or mapping relationships. It's often the difference between a brute-force and an optimal solution.
- **Design:** This is a major differentiator for Databricks. Be prepared for object-oriented design (like designing a parking lot) and, especially for experienced candidates, low-level system design (like a distributed key-value store or a data pipeline).
- **Dynamic Programming:** While not in the top five by pure count, it's a common theme in Medium and Hard problems, particularly for optimization questions involving arrays or strings (e.g., longest increasing subsequence, edit distance).

For the top topic, **Array**, the most important pattern is the **Two-Pointer Technique**. It's essential for solving problems with sorted data, in-place operations, or searching for pairs.

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable given the difficulty curve.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Build deep mastery in the top topics: Array, String, Hash Table, Matrix, and Linked List. For each, learn 2-3 key patterns (e.g., Sliding Window for Strings, DFS/BFS for Matrix). Solve 15-20 curated Medium problems per topic. Use a timer from day one.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Difficulty Ramp.** Move to advanced patterns like Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Heaps. Start mixing in Hard problems. Begin dedicated preparation for Design. For object-oriented design, practice outlining classes, relationships, and key methods for common systems. For system design, study fundamentals of scalability, consistency, and Databricks-relevant concepts like data partitioning and caching.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Company-Specific Practice.** Conduct at least 6-8 mock interviews simulating the exact Databricks format (45-60 minutes, starting with a Medium, potentially escalating to a Hard). Practice articulating your thought process aloud. In the final week, solve only past Databricks questions to acclimate to their problem style and complexity. Focus on clean, production-ready code with error handling and clear comments.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second.** For any Medium or Hard problem, do not start coding until you have analyzed the time and space complexity of your approach and can justify why it's optimal. Interviewers explicitly look for this.
2.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Narrate your thought process, from problem understanding to edge case consideration. If you hit a blocker, talk through your debugging steps. Silence is your biggest enemy.
3.  **Write Production-Quality Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include a brief comment for complex logic, and handle obvious edge cases (null input, empty array, single element). Show you write code you'd deploy.
4.  **Practice Design Separately.** Do not treat design as an afterthought. Dedicate specific study sessions to it. For system design, practice drawing clear diagrams and discussing trade-offs between different architectural choices.
5.  **Test Your Own Code.** Before declaring "done," walk through your code with a small but non-trivial test case, including edge cases. Verbally state the expected output and step through the logic. This catches most bugs.

Consistent, focused practice on high-difficulty problems across these key areas is the most reliable path to success. Start with the fundamentals, ramp up the intensity, and simulate the real environment as closely as possible.
