## How to Crack VK Coding Interviews in 2026

VK, Russia’s largest social media and technology company, runs a rigorous but predictable technical interview process. Candidates typically face 2-3 rounds of algorithmic problem-solving, focusing on practical coding skills over theoretical deep dives. The goal is to assess your ability to write clean, efficient code under time constraints. Based on an analysis of recent VK interview data, success hinges on mastering a well-defined set of core patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Our data from 13 recent VK coding questions reveals a clear trend: **62% Easy (8 questions), 38% Medium (5 questions), and 0% Hard**. This distribution is crucial for your preparation strategy.

VK interviews are not about obscure, complex algorithms. They test fundamentals, clean implementation, and the ability to apply common patterns correctly. The absence of Hard problems means you should prioritize breadth and fluency over depth in niche topics. Your goal is to solve Easy problems flawlessly and quickly, leaving ample time to reason through and implement Medium-level challenges without major errors. This focus on core competency over "gotcha" questions makes VK an excellent target for structured preparation.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-frequency topics. Master these, and you'll cover the vast majority of problems you'll see.

- **Array (Top Topic):** The foundation. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and combining with other patterns like Two Pointers.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems. Focus on manipulation, comparison, and palindrome checks.
- **Two Pointers:** A critical technique for optimizing solutions that involve pairs, subarrays, or sorted data, frequently used with Arrays and Strings.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Appears in Medium problems. Key for optimization questions like "maximum sum" or "number of ways" where overlapping subproblems exist.
- **Sliding Window:** The go-to pattern for problems dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings with specific conditions (e.g., longest substring with K distinct characters).

The most important pattern to master is **Two Pointers**, as it's a versatile tool that appears across multiple topics. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # 'write' pointer places the next unique element
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write  # New length
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-based plan is optimal for VK's profile.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Fundamentals.** Dedicate one day each to Array, String, and Two Pointers. Solve 8-10 problems per topic, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Focus on writing bug-free code on your first try.

**Weeks 3-4: Essential Patterns.** Tackle Sliding Window and Dynamic Programming. For DP, start with foundational 1D problems (Fibonacci, climbing stairs) before moving to classic Medium problems like "Longest Increasing Subsequence." Solve 5-7 problems for each pattern.

**Week 5: Mixed Practice & Mock Interviews.** Use the VK-tagged question list on TidyBit. Simulate the 45-60 minute interview environment: solve one Easy and one Medium problem back-to-back. Practice verbalizing your thought process.

**Week 6: Final Review & Weakness Targeting.** Revisit mistakes from your practice log. Redo 2-3 problems from each core topic without looking at solutions to ensure mastery. Focus on maintaining speed and accuracy.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Speed on Easy Problems.** You must solve Easy questions within 10-15 minutes. This builds time credit for the Medium round. Practice until your solutions for classic Easy problems (array rotations, string reversal, basic hash map use) are automatic.
2.  **Communicate Before You Code.** Clearly state the brute-force approach first, then explain your optimization (e.g., "We can improve from O(n²) to O(n) using a sliding window"). This demonstrates structured problem-solving.
3.  **Prioritize Readability Over Cleverness.** Use descriptive variable names (`slow_pointer`, `max_sum`). Write a few lines of clear code instead of a one-line trick. VK values maintainable code.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring completion, verbally run through tests: empty input, single element, sorted/reversed order, negative numbers. This shows attention to detail.

Cracking the VK interview is a test of disciplined preparation. By mastering the core topics of Array, String, Two Pointers, and Sliding Window, and by building fluency through timed practice, you can approach your interview with confidence. The pattern is clear—now it's your turn to execute.
