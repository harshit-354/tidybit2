When preparing for technical interviews at DoorDash and Roblox, you'll find both similarities and distinct differences in their question profiles. While both companies heavily test core data structures, their focus areas, difficulty distribution, and question volume vary significantly. Understanding these nuances is key to efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

DoorDash's question pool is notably larger and more challenging. With 87 total questions, its distribution (87 Easy, 51 Medium, 30 Hard) shows a strong emphasis on medium and hard problems. This reflects DoorDash's focus on complex backend systems, logistics optimization, and real-time data processing, which require robust algorithmic problem-solving.

Roblox presents a smaller, more approachable set. Its 56 questions are skewed towards easier problems (8 Easy, 36 Medium, 12 Hard). This aligns with Roblox's domain, where strong foundational skills in game logic, simulation, and physics systems are crucial, but the hardest algorithmic puzzles may be less frequent than at a logistics-focused company.

**Key Takeaway:** Expect a more rigorous and extensive algorithmic screening at DoorDash. Roblox's interview, while still demanding, may place greater weight on implementation clarity and foundational knowledge within a slightly narrower scope.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize **Array, Hash Table, and String** manipulation. These form the essential toolkit for most coding interviews. However, their specialized topics reveal their engineering domains.

**DoorDash** frequently employs **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, often for problems involving tree/graph traversal, which models routing, mapping, and hierarchical data structures common in delivery platforms.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DFS skeleton for tree problems (DoorDash)
def dfs(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    return dfs(node.left, target) or dfs(node.right, target)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS skeleton for tree problems (DoorDash)
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS skeleton for tree problems (DoorDash)
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}
```

</div>

**Roblox** highlights **Math** as a key topic. This is critical for game development, involving geometry, vectors, probability for game mechanics, and physics calculations.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example math problem: check if point is within a circle (Roblox)
def is_point_in_circle(px, py, cx, cy, radius):
    distance_squared = (px - cx)**2 + (py - cy)**2
    return distance_squared <= radius**2
```

```javascript
// Example math problem: check if point is within a circle (Roblox)
function isPointInCircle(px, py, cx, cy, radius) {
  const distanceSquared = (px - cx) ** 2 + (py - cy) ** 2;
  return distanceSquared <= radius ** 2;
}
```

```java
// Example math problem: check if point is within a circle (Roblox)
public boolean isPointInCircle(double px, double py, double cx, double cy, double radius) {
    double distanceSquared = Math.pow(px - cx, 2) + Math.pow(py - cy, 2);
    return distanceSquared <= Math.pow(radius, 2);
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Roblox** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. The smaller question count and lower proportion of hard problems allow you to solidify core competencies in arrays, hash maps, and strings, while introducing the math-focused thinking required for game-adjacent roles. This foundation is entirely transferable.

Prepare for **DoorDash** once you are comfortable with medium-level problems and are ready to tackle a higher volume of more complex questions, particularly those involving graph traversal and advanced data structure combinations. The DoorDash question set will rigorously test your ability to optimize solutions under constraints, a skill that will also make you well-prepared for Roblox's interviews.

Ultimately, your choice should align with your target role. For backend/system-heavy positions, lean into DoorDash's profile. For roles involving simulation, game logic, or engine work, Roblox's math focus is paramount. Mastering the shared core topics will benefit you for both.
