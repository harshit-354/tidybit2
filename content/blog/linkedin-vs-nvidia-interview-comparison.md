When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns is crucial for efficient study. LinkedIn and NVIDIA, while both demanding strong algorithmic skills, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question libraries. LinkedIn's 180 questions lean toward medium difficulty with significant depth in graph traversal, while NVIDIA's 137 questions are more concentrated on fundamental data manipulation with a heavier emphasis on easier problems. A strategic approach to preparation can save significant time and increase your chances of success.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

LinkedIn's question bank is larger and more challenging. With 180 total questions (26 Easy, 117 Medium, 37 Hard), the distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty. This suggests LinkedIn interviews often test for robust problem-solving on non-trivial algorithmic concepts, requiring candidates to handle complex implementations and edge cases consistently.

NVIDIA's profile is notably different. With 137 questions (34 Easy, 89 Medium, 14 Hard), it has a higher proportion of Easy questions and far fewer Hard ones. The overall smaller volume and lower difficulty skew indicate that NVIDIA interviews may place a stronger initial emphasis on foundational correctness, speed, and mastery of core data structures before delving into the most complex algorithmic puzzles. Solid fundamentals are paramount.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These form the essential core for both interview loops. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

The key divergence is in the next layer of focus:

- **LinkedIn** prominently features **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a fundamental graph and tree traversal algorithm. This aligns with LinkedIn's domain of social networks and connection graphs, making tree and graph problems highly relevant.
- **NVIDIA** highlights **Sorting** as a core topic. Efficient data organization and manipulation is critical in systems and hardware-adjacent software, making sorting and its applications a frequent theme.

This means your study plan should branch after mastering the shared core.
For LinkedIn, you must become proficient in recursive and iterative DFS, tree traversals, and cycle detection.
For NVIDIA, you should deeply understand various sorting algorithms (quick, merge, heap) and, more importantly, their application in solving problems (e.g., using sorting to enable a two-pointer solution).

```python
# Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn-relevant)
def dfs(node, visited):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    # Process node here
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs(neighbor, visited)

# Example Sorting application (NVIDIA-relevant)
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    nums.sort()  # Sorting enables the two-pointer technique
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn-relevant)
function dfs(node, visited) {
  if (!node || visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  // Process node here
  for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {
    dfs(neighbor, visited);
  }
}

// Example Sorting application (NVIDIA-relevant)
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left, right];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example DFS pattern (LinkedIn-relevant)
public void dfs(Node node, Set<Node> visited) {
    if (node == null || visited.contains(node)) return;
    visited.add(node);
    // Process node here
    for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
        dfs(neighbor, visited);
    }
}

// Example Sorting application (NVIDIA-relevant)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
    Arrays.sort(nums); // Sorting enables the two-pointer technique
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left, right};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **NVIDIA first**. Its focus on a slightly smaller set of core topics (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Sorting) with a greater number of Easy problems provides a more manageable foundation. Excelling here will solidify the essential skills that are also completely relevant for LinkedIn. You can build confidence and speed on fundamental problems.

Once NVIDIA's core is strong, transition to **LinkedIn** preparation by layering on the additional **graph and tree traversal** concepts, particularly DFS and its variants (like backtracking). This approach creates a logical progression from foundational data structure manipulation to more complex recursive and graph-based problem-solving.
