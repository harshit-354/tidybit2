String manipulation is a core skill tested in Flipkart's technical interviews. With 19 out of 117 tagged questions focusing on strings, it's a domain you cannot afford to overlook. For a company handling massive e-commerce data—product titles, search queries, user reviews, and transaction logs—the ability to efficiently process, validate, and transform textual data is critical. Interviewers use string problems to assess your grasp of fundamental algorithms, attention to edge cases, and ability to write clean, efficient code under constraints.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Flipkart's string questions typically fall into a few key categories. **Pattern Matching and Searching** is common, involving algorithms like KMP or Rabin-Karp to find substrings, which mirrors real-world search functionality. **String Transformation and Encoding** problems, such as run-length encoding or validating/formatting strings (e.g., phone numbers), test your ability to manipulate data precisely. **Palindrome and Anagram** variations are frequent, often combined with constraints requiring optimized two-pointer or hashing solutions. **Sliding Window on Strings** is a crucial pattern for problems about finding substrings with specific characteristics, like the longest substring without repeating characters or substrings containing all characters of another string. Finally, **Interleaving and Dynamic Programming** on strings appears in more advanced rounds, testing your problem decomposition skills.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with Code Example

Focus on mastering fundamental patterns rather than memorizing solutions. Practice implementing core algorithms like KMP from scratch. Always analyze time and space complexity. Pay extreme attention to edge cases: empty strings, single characters, case sensitivity, and Unicode characters. A highly effective strategy is to map problems to known patterns. For instance, many "substring" problems are solvable with the **Sliding Window** pattern. Here is a concrete example for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, a classic Flipkart question.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        # If char seen and its index is within current window, shrink window
        if ch in char_index and char_index[ch] >= left:
            left = char_index[ch] + 1
        char_index[ch] = right
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charIndex = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const ch = s[right];
    if (charIndex.has(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
      left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
    }
    charIndex.set(ch, right);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charIndex = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(right);
        if (charIndex.containsKey(ch) && charIndex.get(ch) >= left) {
            left = charIndex.get(ch) + 1;
        }
        charIndex.put(ch, right);
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

This pattern uses a hash map to track the most recent index of each character and a sliding window defined by `left` and `right` pointers. It runs in O(n) time.

## Recommended Practice Order

Start with basic operations and palindrome problems to build confidence. Move to anagram detection and simple sliding window problems. Then, tackle more complex sliding window applications and pattern matching algorithms (practice implementing KMP). Finally, attempt dynamic programming problems on strings, like edit distance or interleaving strings. Consistently solve problems on platforms like TidyBit, focusing on Flipkart's tagged questions to understand their specific style and difficulty curve.
