Delhivery’s coding interviews are designed to assess your problem-solving skills and your ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. As a leading logistics and supply chain company, their technical interviews typically involve a mix of algorithmic problem-solving and system design, with a strong emphasis on practical, scalable solutions. For the coding round, you can expect a standard format of 4-5 problems to be solved within 60-90 minutes, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or CodePair.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, the typical Delhivery coding round consists of 4 questions with the following distribution:

- **Easy:** 1 question (25%)
- **Medium:** 2 questions (50%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (25%)

This breakdown is strategic. The easy problem is your warm-up and a check for basic coding competency—failing here is a major red flag. The two medium problems are the core of the interview; solving both optimally is often the minimum bar to pass. They test your grasp of fundamental data structures and common algorithms. The single hard problem is the differentiator. It’s used to separate good candidates from exceptional ones. You may not need a fully optimal solution, but you must demonstrate a clear, logical approach and communicate your thought process effectively. Your goal should be to flawlessly solve the easy, efficiently solve both mediums, and make significant progress on the hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequently tested topics are Array, Database, Math, String, and Recursion. Mastering these areas will cover the vast majority of problems you’ll encounter.

- **Array:** The cornerstone of algorithmic interviews. Expect problems involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and prefix sums. You must be able to manipulate arrays in-place and handle edge cases.
- **Database:** While less common in pure coding rounds, SQL questions can appear, testing your ability to write efficient queries involving joins, aggregation, and filtering. Be ready for questions on order logistics, inventory, or shipment tracking data.
- **Math:** Problems often involve number theory (prime numbers, GCD), modular arithmetic, or combinatorial logic. These questions test your analytical thinking more than complex data structures.
- **String:** Focus on pattern matching, anagrams, palindromes, and string transformation. These problems often overlap with array techniques and recursion.
- **Recursion:** A fundamental concept for backtracking, divide-and-conquer, and tree/graph traversal. It’s crucial for solving the harder combinatorial or search-based problems.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is arguably the most important array/string pattern for Delhivery's medium-difficulty problems, especially for scenarios involving contiguous subarrays or substrings, like finding the longest substring with K distinct characters or the maximum sum of a subarray of fixed size.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    """Returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(arr) < k:
        return -1

    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Slide the window: remove leftmost element, add new rightmost element
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum

# Example
print(max_sum_subarray([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3))  # Output: 9 (from subarray [5, 1, 3])
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarray(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return -1;

  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Slide the window
    windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}

// Example
console.log(maxSumSubarray([2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], 3)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class SlidingWindow {
    public static int maxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length < k) return -1;

        int windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        int maxSum = windowSum;

        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(maxSumSubarray(arr, 3)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key. Here is a focused 4-6 week plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Deep dive into **Arrays** and **Strings**. Practice all major patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sum. Solve 15-20 problems.
- Days 8-14: Master **Recursion** and Backtracking. Then, learn fundamental data structures: Hash Maps, Sets, Stacks, and Queues. Solve another 15-20 problems mixing these concepts.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Topic Integration**

- Days 15-21: Tackle **Math**-based problems and advanced algorithms: Binary Search, and basic Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack).
- Days 22-28: Practice **Database** SQL problems. Focus on JOINs (INNER, LEFT), GROUP BY with HAVING, and subqueries. Spend the rest of the week on mixed-topic Medium problems, simulating the actual interview format.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Repair**

- Schedule at least 6-8 mock interviews. Use platforms like TidyBit's mock interview feature or practice with peers.
- Identify your weak topics from the mocks. Dedicate entire days to drilling those specific areas (e.g., if recursion is weak, do 10 recursion-only problems).
- In the final 3 days, stop learning new topics. Review your notes, re-solve key problems you've already done, and focus on rest.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** Never go silent. Talk through your initial thoughts, discuss brute force, then optimize. Ask clarifying questions. This is as important as your code.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally:** Always state the brute-force solution first (O(n²) is fine to mention), then explain how you can improve it. This shows structured thinking.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code:** Use meaningful variable names, add brief comments for complex logic, and handle edge cases explicitly (empty input, single element, large values). Write a few test cases verbally.
4.  **Manage Your Time Rigorously:** Allocate time based on difficulty: 10 mins for Easy, 15-20 mins each for Medium, 25 mins for Hard. If stuck for more than 5 minutes on an approach, state you're pivoting and try another angle.
5.  **Practice with Logistics Context:** While the core is algorithmic, mentally frame problems in Delhivery's domain—think about optimizing delivery routes (graph problems), sorting packages (sorting algorithms), or tracking shipments (hash maps for ID lookup).

Success in Delhivery's coding interview comes from consistent, pattern-focused practice and clear communication. Build the muscle memory for core algorithms so you can focus on problem-solving during the interview.
