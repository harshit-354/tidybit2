When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Oracle and DoorDash represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a massive, established enterprise with a vast question pool, and the other is a large but more focused consumer tech company. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals significant differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and focus areas, which should directly inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer number of questions. Oracle's tagged question bank on TidyBit is **340 questions**, dwarfing DoorDash's **87 questions**. This volume makes Oracle's interview landscape broader and potentially less predictable.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **Oracle (340q):** Easy 70 (21%), Medium 205 (60%), Hard 65 (19%)
- **DoorDash (87q):** Easy 6 (7%), Medium 51 (59%), Hard 30 (34%)

Oracle follows a more traditional distribution, with Medium problems forming the clear majority. DoorDash, however, has a significantly higher proportion of Hard problems—over one-third of its question bank. This suggests DoorDash interviews may place a greater emphasis on complex problem-solving and optimization in their coding rounds, even for early-career roles. The low number of Easy questions for DoorDash indicates they are rarely the focus of their technical screens.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are top topics for both, forming a critical common ground for preparation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# This pattern is fundamental for both companies.
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in their secondary focus areas:

- **Oracle** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. With 65 Hard problems, many will involve DP patterns (e.g., Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence). Mastery of DP is non-negotiable for Oracle.
- **DoorDash** prominently features **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This aligns with common interview questions involving tree/graph traversal, pathfinding, or state-space search, which are highly relevant for mapping, logistics, and menu-like data structures.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS pattern important for DoorDash
def dfs(node, target, path):
    if not node:
        return
    path.append(node.val)
    if node.val == target:
        print(path)
    dfs(node.left, target, path)
    dfs(node.right, target, path)
    path.pop()
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS pattern important for DoorDash
function dfs(node, target, path = []) {
  if (!node) return;
  path.push(node.val);
  if (node.val === target) {
    console.log(path);
  }
  dfs(node.left, target, path);
  dfs(node.right, target, path);
  path.pop();
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS pattern important for DoorDash
public void dfs(TreeNode node, int target, List<Integer> path) {
    if (node == null) return;
    path.add(node.val);
    if (node.val == target) {
        System.out.println(path);
    }
    dfs(node.left, target, path);
    dfs(node.right, target, path);
    path.remove(path.size() - 1);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the company's scope.

**Prepare for DoorDash first if** you are interviewing with them soon. Its smaller, more concentrated question bank is manageable to cover in depth. You can achieve strong coverage by mastering the core topics (Array, Hash Table, String) and then drilling deeply into DFS/Graph patterns and a higher volume of Hard problems. The ROI on focused study is high.

**Prepare for Oracle first if** you are early in a general interview cycle or targeting enterprise roles. Oracle's vast question bank requires a longer, broader foundation. Excelling at Oracle preparation—especially conquering a wide array of Medium problems and a significant number of DP-based Hards—will build a formidable skill set that translates well to other companies, including DoorDash. The core topics overlap, and the DP practice will only strengthen your problem-solving muscles, even if DoorDash asks it less frequently.

In short, use DoorDash for targeted, deep preparation under time constraints. Use Oracle for building a comprehensive, transferable foundation in data structures and algorithms.
