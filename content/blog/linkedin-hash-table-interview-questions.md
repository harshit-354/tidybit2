Hash Table questions appear in 18% of LinkedIn’s coding problems (33 out of 180). This reflects their engineering focus on scalable data systems, real-time features, and efficient lookups—core to products like news feeds, connection graphs, and messaging. Mastering hash tables demonstrates you can handle high-throughput, low-latency scenarios, a daily reality at LinkedIn.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

LinkedIn’s hash table problems often involve **string manipulation**, **frequency counting**, and **caching or memoization**. You’ll see:

- **String/Array Frequency Analysis**: Finding duplicates, anagrams, or character counts.
- **Two-Sum Variants**: Pairing elements to meet a sum, often extended to multiple data structures.
- **Design Problems**: Implementing data structures like LRU Cache (hash map + doubly linked list).
- **Graph/Network Adjacency**: Storing connections or relationships efficiently.

Expect follow-ups on **time/space trade-offs** and **scaling considerations**—Linked interviewers frequently probe how your solution behaves with large datasets.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on recognizing when a hash table can reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). Practice writing clean implementations quickly. A key pattern is **using a hash map to store complements or needed values** as you traverse data.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage:
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

</div>

This pattern is foundational. Practice variations like **Two Sum II (sorted input)**, **Subarray Sum Equals K**, and **Anagram Grouping**.

## Recommended Practice Order

1. **Fundamentals**: Two Sum, First Unique Character, Valid Anagram.
2. **Frequency Maps**: Top K Frequent Elements, Group Anagrams.
3. **Advanced Patterns**: LRU Cache, Insert Delete GetRandom O(1).
4. **LinkedIn-Specific**: Solve all 33 hash table problems on TidyBit, focusing on their most frequent questions.

Prioritize problems that combine hash tables with other structures (linked lists, heaps) to handle LinkedIn’s system design nuances.
