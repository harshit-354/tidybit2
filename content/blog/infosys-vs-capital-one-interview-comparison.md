When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Infosys and Capital One represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a global IT services and consulting giant with a broad, high-volume question bank, while the other is a major financial institution with a more concentrated, medium-difficulty focus. This comparison breaks down their question patterns to help you target your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a stark difference in scope. Infosys's list of **158 questions** is nearly three times the size of Capital One's **57 questions**. This volume suggests that Infosys interviews may pull from a wider pool of problems, requiring broader familiarity with patterns rather than deep, repeated study of a small set.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The majority of questions are rated Medium (82), with a significant number of Easy (42) and Hard (34) problems. This spread indicates a comprehensive assessment that can test fundamental coding skills, core problem-solving, and advanced algorithmic thinking.
- **Capital One (E11/M36/H10):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions (36 out of 57). The lower counts of Easy (11) and Hard (10) questions suggest their interviews are calibrated to evaluate strong, practical problem-solving ability on common challenges, with less emphasis on extreme fundamentals or highly complex algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, which are foundational to most coding interviews. **Math** problems also appear on both lists. This common ground is where you should build rock-solid proficiency.

The key difference lies in their secondary focuses:

- **Infosys** places significant emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is a specialized, challenging topic that requires dedicated practice to recognize patterns and formulate optimal substructures.
- **Capital One** frequently tests **Hash Table** usage. This points to an interview style that prioritizes practical data structure knowledge for efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving problems involving duplicates or mappings.

Here’s a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using a hash table (relevant for Capital One) or a more brute-force array approach:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Using a Hash Table (Optimal - O(n) time)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) returns [0, 1]
```

```javascript
// Using a Hash Table (Optimal - O(n) time)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Using a Hash Table (Optimal - O(n) time)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your timeline and the role you're targeting.

**Prepare for Capital One first if:** You are newer to technical interviews or have a shorter timeline. The smaller, more focused question bank centered on Medium-difficulty Array, String, and Hash Table problems is a manageable and highly relevant starting point for many tech roles. Mastering these will build a strong foundation.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are targeting roles that require deep algorithmic knowledge (like many developer positions at IT services firms), have more preparation time, or want to force a broader study regimen. The high volume and the inclusion of Dynamic Programming will push you to cover more ground, which subsequently makes a smaller bank like Capital One's feel less daunting.

Ultimately, the core skills for both overlap significantly. Solidify your understanding of arrays, strings, and hash maps, then branch out based on your target company's specific demands.
