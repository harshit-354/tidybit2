# Sliding Window Interview Questions: Patterns and Strategies

The sliding window technique is a cornerstone of efficient array and string processing. In coding interviews, it transforms naive O(n²) solutions into optimal O(n) ones. With 128 questions tagged on our platform—spanning Google, Amazon, and Meta—mastering this pattern is non-negotiable. It’s not just about solving problems; it’s about demonstrating you can optimize real-time data streams, substring searches, or rate limiters—skills directly applicable to backend systems and distributed services.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing the window type is the first step to a clean implementation.

**Fixed-Length Window**
Use this when the problem specifies a exact subarray or substring length. Initialize the window with the first `k` elements, then slide it one element at a time, updating by removing the outgoing element and adding the incoming one.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    if len(arr) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarray(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k) {
    if (arr.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

</div>

**Variable-Length Window (Two Pointers)**
This pattern finds a subarray meeting a condition (e.g., sum less than K, longest unique substring). Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the window. Expand the right pointer to add elements, and contract the left pointer when the condition is violated.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_without_repeating(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringWithoutRepeating(s) {
  const charSet = new Set();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (charSet.has(s[right])) {
      charSet.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    charSet.add(s[right]);
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringWithoutRepeating(String s) {
    Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
            charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

**Count-Based Window with HashMap**
For problems involving anagrams or permutations, use a frequency map. Maintain a map of required character counts. As the window slides, update the map and check if the current window matches the target frequencies.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 60% (77 questions) are Medium, 26% (33) are Hard, and only 14% (18) are Easy. This split is telling.

Easy problems typically test basic fixed-window mechanics. Medium problems introduce constraints requiring variable windows and hash maps—these are the core interview questions. Hard problems often combine sliding window with other techniques like heaps or dynamic programming, testing your ability to integrate patterns. The high concentration of Medium questions means you must be fluent in the core variable-length pattern to pass most interviews.

## Which Companies Ask Sliding Window

Top companies frequently test this pattern because it mirrors real-world scenarios like API rate limiting, log analysis, and live data monitoring.

- [Google](/company/google) uses it for distributed system design questions.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) ties it to scalability problems in AWS services.
- [Meta](/company/meta) applies it to real-time feature processing.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) and [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) test it for financial data stream problems.

## Study Tips

1.  **Identify the window type immediately.** Ask: Is the length fixed by `k`? Or is it variable based on a condition? This dictates your entire approach.
2.  **Practice the expansion/contraction cycle.** For variable windows, manually trace how `left` and `right` pointers move. Draw it out for two problems to build muscle memory.
3.  **Prefer hash maps for character counts.** When dealing with strings or anagrams, a frequency map is more efficient and cleaner than nested loops.
4.  **Start with brute force, then optimize.** In an interview, first describe the O(n²) solution. Then explain how a sliding window reduces it to O(n). This shows structured thinking.

Master these patterns, trace through the pointers, and you’ll handle the majority of sliding window problems efficiently.
