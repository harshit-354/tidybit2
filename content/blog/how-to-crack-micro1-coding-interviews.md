Micro1’s coding interviews are known for a consistent, pattern-focused approach. They typically involve two to three 45-60 minute technical rounds, each centered on solving algorithmic problems on a collaborative editor. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code, clear communication, and optimal problem-solving—not on obscure computer science trivia. Understanding their specific focus areas is the fastest path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data reveals a clear strategy: **80% of questions are Medium difficulty, with the remaining 20% being Easy. Hard problems are virtually absent.** This distribution is critical. It means Micro1 is testing for **strong fundamentals and reliable execution under pressure**, not for genius-level insights into arcane algorithms.

A Medium problem at Micro1 often involves combining two core concepts (e.g., a Hash Table with a Sliding Window) or implementing a well-known algorithm like Heap sort or a Greedy approach with a twist. The absence of Hard problems is an advantage; it allows you to focus your preparation on mastering high-frequency patterns rather than spreading yourself thin. Your goal is to solve Medium problems correctly, optimally, and with minimal hesitation.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Based on the data, these five topics form the core of Micro1's interview question bank. Prioritize them in this order.

1.  **String Manipulation:** Often combined with other patterns, especially Hash Tables for frequency counting or two-pointer techniques for in-place operations.
2.  **Hash Table:** The most versatile data structure for achieving O(1) lookups. Used for frequency maps, caches (memoization), and tracking seen elements.
3.  **Greedy Algorithms:** Problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum. Common in scheduling, interval, and "minimum/maximum result" problems.
4.  **Sorting:** Rarely tested in isolation. It's usually the crucial first step that enables a two-pointer or greedy solution.
5.  **Heap (Priority Queue):** Essential for problems requiring repeated access to the "k-th" largest/smallest element or for merging sorted inputs.

The most critical combined pattern for Micro1 is likely **Hash Table for frequency counting within a String or Array**. This pattern is the foundation for solving anagrams, first unique characters, and subset validation problems.

```python
def find_first_unique_char(s: str) -> int:
    """Return index of first non-repeating character, else -1."""
    freq = {}
    # First pass: build frequency map
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    # Second pass: find first char with freq == 1
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if freq[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

```javascript
function findFirstUniqueChar(s) {
  const freq = new Map();
  // First pass: build frequency map
  for (const char of s) {
    freq.set(char, (freq.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Second pass: find first char with freq == 1
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (freq.get(s[i]) === 1) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    // First pass: build frequency map
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    // Second pass: find first char with freq == 1
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (freq.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Focus exclusively on **Easy** problems for **String, Hash Table, and Sorting**. The goal is speed and accuracy. Solve 30-40 problems.
- Learn the standard library for these structures in your language (e.g., `collections.Counter` in Python, `Map`/`Set` in JS, `HashMap`/`HashSet` in Java).

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery**

- Shift entirely to **Medium** problems. Each day, focus on a combination: e.g., "String + Hash Table" or "Sorting + Greedy."
- Practice **Heap** problems here. Implement a max-heap/min-heap from scratch once, then use your language's library (`heapq`, `PriorityQueue`).
- Target 50-60 Medium problems, prioritizing those tagged with Micro1's top topics.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

- Stop learning new patterns. Focus on recall and performance.
- Conduct at least 6-8 timed, 45-minute mock interviews. Use a platform that allows voice communication. Simulate the real pressure.
- Re-solve every problem you previously struggled with. Your final week should be about reinforcing known patterns, not discovering new ones.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before you write code, state the brute-force approach, then explain your optimization (e.g., "We can use a hash map here to reduce the lookup from O(n) to O(1)"). Narrate your thoughts as you code.
2.  **Validate with Edge Cases.** After writing your solution, immediately walk through 2-3 test cases: empty input, single element, large input, and a case that triggers your main logic. This demonstrates thoroughness.
3.  **Know Your Language's Collections Inside Out.** Be prepared to explain the time/space complexity of your operations (e.g., inserting into a Python `dict`, popping from a JavaScript array, peeking in a Java `PriorityQueue`).
4.  **If Stuck, Simplify.** If you can't see the optimal solution for a Medium problem within 3-5 minutes, implement the brute-force solution first. This gives you a working baseline and often reveals the path to optimization. A working sub-optimal solution is better than no solution.

Mastering these focused patterns and executing this deliberate plan will position you strongly for the Micro1 interview loop. Consistency beats cramming every time.
