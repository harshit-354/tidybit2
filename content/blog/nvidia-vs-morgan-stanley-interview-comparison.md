Preparing for technical interviews requires understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each company. NVIDIA and Morgan Stanley, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct challenges in their coding interviews. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

NVIDIA's question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With 137 total questions (34 Easy, 89 Medium, 14 Hard), the sheer volume indicates a broader scope and a deeper emphasis on problem-solving under pressure. The distribution—65% Medium, 10% Hard—shows they frequently test complex, multi-step logic beyond foundational concepts. Expect a rigorous coding screen.

Morgan Stanley's set is more contained at 53 questions (13 Easy, 34 Medium, 6 Hard). The Medium-dominant distribution (64%) is similar, but the lower total count and fewer Hard questions suggest a slightly more predictable interview loop. The focus is on assessing competent, reliable coding ability rather than solving novel, highly complex algorithms.

**Key Takeaway:** NVIDIA requires more extensive and advanced practice. Morgan Stanley's preparation can be more targeted.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. Array, String, and Hash Table problems form a common foundation. You must be fluent in manipulating these.

- **NVIDIA** adds **Sorting** as a key topic. This often involves implementing or leveraging efficient sorts (Quick, Merge) within broader algorithm design.
- **Morgan Stanley** highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This signals a strong focus on optimization problems, recursion with memoization, and bottom-up tabulation.

This divergence is critical. NVIDIA's sorting focus leans towards problems involving ordering, searching, and partitioning data efficiently. Morgan Stanley's DP focus tests your ability to break down complex problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

Consider a problem that could appear at either, but with a different emphasis:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# NVIDIA-style: Sorting as a key step.
def findMaxK(nums):
    nums.sort()
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        sum_val = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if sum_val == 0:
            return abs(nums[right])
        elif sum_val < 0:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return -1
# Finds largest K where -K also exists. Sorting enables two-pointer solution.
```

```javascript
// Morgan Stanley-style: DP for optimization.
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(amount + 1);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (coin <= i) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
// Classic DP (coin change). Tests optimal substructure thinking.
```

```java
// NVIDIA-style: Sorting.
public int findMaxK(int[] nums) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == 0) {
            return Math.abs(nums[right]);
        } else if (sum < 0) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

// Morgan Stanley-style: DP.
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin <= i) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Morgan Stanley**. Its smaller, more focused question set allows you to build a strong foundation in the shared topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and master the critical additional topic of Dynamic Programming. This creates a solid core competency.

Then, move to **NVIDIA**. Use the foundation from Morgan Stanley prep and expand it. Tackle the larger volume of questions, deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms and their applications, and practice the increased number of Medium and Hard problems to build the stamina and depth required.

This sequential approach is efficient: you build from a targeted to a broad scope, ensuring you cover all common ground while layering on each company's unique demands.
