Wise’s technical interview process is known for its practical, product-aligned focus. While they ask classic data structure and algorithm questions, they often frame problems around real-world financial scenarios like currency conversion or transaction analysis. The goal is to assess not just raw coding skill, but your ability to build efficient, scalable logic—a critical trait for a global money transfer platform. Success requires a targeted approach to the specific patterns they favor.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Wise's coding interviews are heavily weighted toward medium-difficulty problems (75%), with the remainder being easy (25%). Notably, hard problems are absent from the typical first-round screening. This breakdown is revealing: Wise is testing for strong fundamentals and reliable problem-solving under pressure, not obscure algorithmic trivia. You need to be exceptionally consistent and clean in your implementation of core patterns. Missing an edge case on a medium problem is far more costly here than failing to solve a hard one. The expectation is that you can dissect a moderately complex requirement—often related to processing sequences of data—and implement a robust, optimized solution within 30-40 minutes.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a cohesive set for analyzing data sequences, which mirrors Wise's domain of processing transaction streams and financial data.

- **Array:** The fundamental data structure. Expect heavy manipulation, in-place operations, and transformations.
- **Binary Search:** Applied not just on sorted arrays, but on answer spaces for optimization problems (e.g., "find the minimum transfer time").
- **Sliding Window:** Crucial for analyzing contiguous subsequences under certain conditions, ideal for problems involving time windows or rate limits.
- **Prefix Sum:** The go-to technique for rapidly answering repeated queries about subarray sums, a common need in financial aggregation.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Used for optimization over sequences, such as finding the most efficient way to bundle transactions or minimize costs.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is particularly powerful for Wise-style problems involving limits or contiguous data segments. Here’s a template for the fixed-size window maximum:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray(nums, k):
    """Return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k."""
    if len(nums) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarray(nums, k) {
  if (nums.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = nums.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSumSubarray(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: Foundation. Drill the top five topics exclusively. For each, solve 10-15 problems, starting with easy and progressing to medium. Focus on internalizing the patterns, not memorizing solutions. Implement every solution in your primary language.

Weeks 3-4: Integration and Speed. Start mixing topics. Practice 2-3 medium problems daily under timed conditions (25 minutes for problem-solving, 10 minutes for writing and testing). Prioritize problems with a "simulation" or "real-world" flavor. Begin mock interviews focusing on clear communication of your thought process.

Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific Tuning and Polish. Solve all available Wise-specific problems. Simulate full interview loops with a focus on medium-difficulty questions. Refine your ability to quickly identify the core pattern (e.g., "this is a prefix sum problem because we need many subarray sums"). Practice writing production-ready code with clear variable names and error checks from the start.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize Second, Clarify First.** Before diving into code, ask clarifying questions. ("Can the input be empty?" "Are the currency values integers?"). State your assumptions. A correct, well-communicated O(n²) solution is better than a silent, buggy attempt at O(n).
2.  **Prefix Sum is Your Best Friend.** When you see a problem about sums, averages, or aggregates of subarrays, prefix sum should be your first instinct. It's a simple pattern that turns O(n²) brute force into O(n) precomputation and O(1) queries.
3.  **Practice Verbalizing Trade-offs.** Be prepared to explain _why_ you chose a sliding window over two pointers, or a DP memoization over tabulation. Wise evaluates your engineering judgment.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Explicitly run your code through small arrays, large values, and zero cases. Mention this aloud: "Let me quickly test this with an empty input and a window larger than the array size." This demonstrates professional rigor.

Targeted, pattern-based practice on arrays, sliding windows, and prefix sums will build the muscle memory you need. Consistency on medium problems is the key to unlocking the next round.
