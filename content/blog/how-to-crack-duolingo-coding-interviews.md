Duolingo’s coding interviews are designed to assess both your problem-solving skills and your ability to build clean, scalable systems. The process typically involves a technical phone screen followed by a virtual onsite with multiple rounds, which can include coding, system design, and behavioral discussions. The coding problems are algorithm-focused and reflect the company’s work on language processing, educational features, and massive-scale user platforms.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Duolingo’s coding questions break down as follows: 0% Easy, 60% Medium, and 40% Hard. This distribution is telling. You will face no simple warm-ups; the interview begins at a Medium level of complexity. The significant 40% Hard portion indicates they are actively testing for strong algorithmic proficiency and the ability to handle intricate problems, often involving optimization or advanced data structures. This skew towards Medium and Hard means your preparation must be thorough. You need to be comfortable not just with solving problems, but with solving them efficiently under pressure, as the Hard problems often separate candidates.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are **Array**, **Hash Table**, **String**, **Design**, and **Trie**. Mastering these areas is non-negotiable.

- **Array & Hash Table:** These are the bedrock of most solutions. Expect problems involving two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, or prefix sums, often using a hash map for O(1) lookups to achieve optimal time complexity.
- **String:** Duolingo’s domain is language, so string manipulation—anagrams, palindromes, parsing, and matching—is extremely common. KMP or rolling hash (Rabin-Karp) patterns can appear in Hard problems.
- **Design:** This reflects the system design round, but can also appear as "object-oriented design" for a specific feature (e.g., designing a leaderboard or a quiz system). Focus on clear APIs, class relationships, and scalability trade-offs.
- **Trie:** The standout data structure for Duolingo. Given their work with dictionaries, word games, and autocomplete features, the Trie (prefix tree) is a critical tool for problems involving word storage, prefix searches, and efficient string lookups.

The **Trie** is arguably the most distinctive topic. Here is the essential pattern for implementing a basic Trie for insertion and search operations:

<div class="code-group">

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word
```

```javascript
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isEndOfWord = false;
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true;
  }

  search(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    return node.isEndOfWord;
  }
}
```

```java
class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
    boolean isEndOfWord = false;
}

class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            node.children.putIfAbsent(ch, new TrieNode());
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            if (!node.children.containsKey(ch)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        return node.isEndOfWord;
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is key to covering the required depth.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Start with Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings. Solve 15-20 Medium problems for each topic. Focus on mastering patterns like two-pointers, sliding window, and hash map indexing. Implement basic data structures like Trie from scratch.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Topics & Hard Problems.** Dedicate this time to Tries and Design. Solve every Trie problem you can find, including Hard ones (e.g., word search II). For Design, practice both object-oriented design (e.g., design a parking lot) and high-level system design (e.g., design Duolingo's streak feature). Begin mixing in 1-2 Hard problems from other topics daily.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Shift to full problem sets without topic hints. Simulate the interview environment: 45 minutes for a Medium-Hard problem. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly. Review and re-solve the most challenging problems from your earlier practice, ensuring you understand the optimal solution inside out.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Never go silent. Explain your brute-force idea first, then analyze its complexity, and then iterate towards optimization. Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving journey as much as the final code.
2.  **Prioritize Trie Fluency.** Being able to whip out a bug-free Trie implementation and modify it for a problem (e.g., adding a prefix search method) will give you a significant advantage for a large subset of Duolingo's problems.
3.  **Practice Design Clarifications.** For any design question, start by asking clarifying questions about scope, scale, and requirements. A common mistake is jumping into deep technical details before aligning on what exactly needs to be built.
4.  **Optimize Early for Hard Problems.** With a 40% chance of a Hard problem, you must look for the optimal approach from the outset. If your initial thought is O(n²), pause and immediately consider if a hash table, heap, or specialized structure like a Trie can bring it to O(n log n) or O(n).

Your goal is to make solving a Medium problem look easy and to demonstrate systematic, resilient thinking on a Hard one. Target your practice accordingly.
