When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Meta and Atlassian represent two distinct archetypes: a FAANG giant with a massive, well-defined question bank and a major enterprise software company with a more concentrated, but still rigorous, interview process. A direct comparison of their question data reveals clear strategic differences in how you should prepare.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is scale. Meta's question bank is vast, with 1387 catalogued questions. This volume reflects its standardized, high-throughput interview process used across many engineering roles. The difficulty distribution (414 Easy, 762 Medium, 211 Hard) shows a strong emphasis on Medium-level problems, which are the core of their algorithmic interviews. You must be exceptionally fluent in solving Medium problems under time pressure.

In stark contrast, Atlassian's known question pool is significantly smaller at just 62 questions. This suggests a more curated or role-specific interview approach. Its distribution (7 Easy, 43 Medium, 12 Hard) indicates an even heavier relative weighting on Medium-difficulty questions. While the absolute number is low, the probability of encountering a known problem or a close variant may be higher, making deep mastery of this smaller set very valuable.

**Key Takeaway:** For Meta, prepare for breadth and pattern recognition across a huge problem space. For Atlassian, prepare for depth on a narrower, high-impact set of problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures. The top topics are nearly identical:

- **Meta:** Array, String, Hash Table, Math
- **Atlassian:** Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

This overlap is your strategic advantage. Proficiency in these areas is non-negotiable for both. The core techniques—two-pointers, sliding window, hash map indexing, and string manipulation—are universally applicable.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common pattern (Two-Pointer for a sorted array)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# This pattern is highly relevant for both companies.
```

```javascript
// Example: A common pattern (Two-Pointer for a sorted array)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common pattern (Two-Pointer for a sorted array)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

The main difference lies in potential context. Meta questions may more frequently involve large-scale system thinking or optimization (e.g., "Design a data structure for..."), even within a coding question. Atlassian's questions, while still algorithmic, might occasionally lean toward scenarios relevant to collaboration, data integrity, or workflow, reflecting their product domain.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Build robust competency in Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, and Sorting. Solve a mix of Easy and Medium problems from general lists (like LeetCode's Top Interview Questions) to internalize the patterns.

If you have interviews at both, **prepare for Meta's format first**. The rigor and breadth required to tackle Meta's large question bank will inherently cover the technical depth needed for Atlassian. Practicing under Meta's typical constraints—clear communication, optimal solution derivation, and handling follow-ups—creates a strong baseline.

Then, **specialize for Atlassian**. Conduct a targeted review of their specific 62-question list. Understand each problem thoroughly, including edge cases and potential variations. The goal here is not just to memorize solutions but to ensure you can fluidly apply the core patterns you've already learned to their preferred problem set.

Ultimately, Meta preparation is a marathon of pattern recognition, while Atlassian preparation is a sprint of focused depth. Mastering the common core makes you competitive for both.
