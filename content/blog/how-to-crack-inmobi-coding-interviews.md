InMobi’s technical interviews are known for their depth over breadth, focusing heavily on complex problem-solving and algorithmic optimization. The process typically involves multiple rounds of coding interviews where you'll be expected to write clean, efficient code and clearly articulate your thought process. Understanding their specific focus areas is the key to efficient preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Analyzing InMobi's coding question patterns reveals a clear emphasis on high-difficulty problems. The data shows a distribution of 0% Easy, 33% Medium, and a striking 67% Hard questions. This breakdown is critical: it means you must be prepared for intricate algorithmic challenges from the outset. The interview is not designed to warm you up with simple tasks; it tests your ability to handle complex, multi-layered problems under pressure. Your preparation should mirror this intensity, prioritizing mastery of advanced patterns over covering a wide range of simple topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Given the difficulty, you must go deep on the core topics. Here are the top areas with their key patterns.

**Dynamic Programming:** This is non-negotiable. Expect problems involving optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, often disguised in string or array manipulation. Master both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.

**String:** Problems often involve complex manipulations, palindromes, subsequences, or matching patterns, frequently combined with DP. Knowing advanced string algorithms is crucial.

**Breadth-First Search:** Applied in grid traversal, shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, and level-order tree operations. It's a fundamental tool for exploring state space.

**Stack:** Essential for parsing, monotonic stack problems (like next greater element), and simulating recursion. It's frequently the optimal solution for problems requiring "last in, first out" state management.

**Binary Search:** Not just for sorted arrays; be ready for its application in searching over a solution space or in complex data structures. This is a key optimization technique.

The most critical pattern to master is **Dynamic Programming on Strings**, as it combines the two most frequent topics. A classic example is the "Longest Palindromic Subsequence" problem.

```python
def longestPalindromeSubseq(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    # dp[i][j] = LPS length in s[i:j+1]
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1

    # Build from shorter to longer substrings
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                # If ends match, add 2 to inner subsequence
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
            else:
                # Otherwise, take the max of skipping one end
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[0][n - 1]
```

```javascript
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s) {
  const n = s.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => new Array(n).fill(0));

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) dp[i][i] = 1;

  for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
    for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
      const j = i + len - 1;
      if (s[i] === s[j]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[0][n - 1];
}
```

```java
public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) dp[i][i] = 1;

    for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[0][n - 1];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 6-Week Plan

Given the high proportion of Hard problems, a surface-level review won't suffice. Follow this intensive plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Dynamic Programming and Strings. Solve at least 15-20 problems from each topic, focusing on medium-to-hard difficulty. Understand the derivation of state transitions; don't just memorize solutions. Implement both recursive+memoization and iterative DP.

**Weeks 3-4: Secondary Topics & Integration.** Deep dive into BFS, Stack, and Binary Search. Solve another 10-15 problems per topic. Start integrating topics: solve string problems using DP, use BFS for grid-based DP, or apply monotonic stacks in array challenges. This mimics the complexity of actual InMobi questions.

**Week 5: Company-Specific & Mock Interviews.** Solve all available InMobi questions from platforms like TidyBit. Time yourself strictly. Participate in at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or mentor, simulating the full interview environment. Focus on explaining your approach clearly before coding.

**Week 6: Revision & Weakness Attack.** Revisit all problems you found difficult. Redo them without looking at the solution. Systematically review patterns, not individual problems. In the final days, focus on mental readiness and concise communication.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second:** With Hard problems, brute force is rarely the point. Spend the first 5-10 minutes of any problem discussing trade-offs and optimizing your approach before writing a single line of code. Interviewers want to see your optimization mindset.
2.  **Master State Transition Verbally:** For DP problems, practice stating the subproblem definition and transition function aloud. Clear articulation here is often as important as the code itself.
3.  **Test with Complex Edge Cases:** Don't just test with the given example. Actively propose edge cases (empty input, large `n`, descending sequences) and walk through how your algorithm handles them. This demonstrates thoroughness.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor:** Get used to coding without IDE auto-completion. This will improve your recall of syntax and method names, making you more efficient during the interview.

Success in an InMobi interview is built on a foundation of deep, pattern-based practice for high-difficulty problems. Focus your energy accordingly.
