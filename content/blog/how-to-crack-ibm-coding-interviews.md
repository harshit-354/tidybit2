IBM has been reinventing itself around hybrid cloud and AI, and the engineering hiring process has evolved to match. Today's IBM interviews for software engineering roles are more technically demanding than the IBM of a decade ago, but they remain grounded and practical. The company hires across a huge range of teams — Watson, Red Hat, Cloud Pak, Quantum — and the interview difficulty can vary by division. That said, the coding fundamentals expected are consistent.

The typical IBM interview process includes an online assessment (often on HackerRank), a phone or video technical screen, and two to three on-site rounds covering coding, technical depth in your domain, and behavioral fit. Some teams add a system design round for senior roles. IBM also runs coding challenges and hackathons as alternative entry points.

## By the Numbers

IBM's TidyBit question bank contains **170 questions** with a notably approachable difficulty curve:

- **Easy: 52 questions (31%)** — Almost a third of the bank, giving you plenty of warmup material.
- **Medium: 102 questions (60%)** — The clear majority. IBM interviews are anchored in Medium-level problem solving.
- **Hard: 16 questions (9%)** — The lowest hard-question percentage among major tech companies. Hard problems are rare in IBM interviews.

The 31/60/9 distribution tells you that IBM values reliable problem-solving skills over algorithmic heroics. If you can consistently solve Medium problems without bugs, you are well-positioned.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Array** — The dominant topic. IBM array problems cover a wide range: searching, merging, partitioning, and subarray calculations. Many of these appear on the HackerRank assessment, so practice solving them quickly and correctly. A classic example is finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (Kadane's Algorithm). Understanding how to manipulate indices and use prefix sums is crucial.

**String** — Expect string manipulation, substring problems, and basic parsing tasks. IBM string problems tend to be straightforward in their requirements but can trip you up on edge cases if you are not careful. Common tasks include checking for palindromes, reversing strings in-place, and finding the longest common prefix. Always consider character encoding (ASCII vs. Unicode) and empty string cases.

**Two Pointers** — IBM leans into two-pointer problems more than many companies at a similar difficulty tier. Pair sums, removing duplicates, and partitioning arrays around a pivot — these are high-frequency patterns. The two-pointer approach also shows up in string problems like palindrome verification. Mastering the technique of having one pointer at the start and another at the end, or both moving from the start at different speeds, is key.

**Sorting** — Custom sorting, sorting as a preprocessing step for binary search or two-pointer techniques, and problems that require stable versus unstable sort awareness. IBM questions frequently set up a scenario where sorting the input first makes the actual algorithm trivial. For instance, many "find pairs" or "triplet sum" problems become linear or O(n log n) after sorting. Know the time and space complexities of common sorts like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.

**Hash Table** — The utility player in IBM's question set. Hash maps turn up in frequency counting, lookup optimization, and grouping problems. While not the primary topic, nearly every Medium problem benefits from hash table thinking. They are often used to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) at the cost of O(n) space. Be prepared to implement a simple hash table from scratch to demonstrate understanding of collision handling (chaining or open addressing).

## Preparation Strategy

**Weeks 1-2: Core Fundamentals**

Start with Easy problems across arrays, strings, and hash tables. Solve 4 to 5 per day. IBM's HackerRank assessment often starts with easier problems to filter quickly, and you want to clear those fast without losing time. In week two, begin incorporating two-pointer problems on sorted arrays and linked lists. Build muscle memory for basic operations.

**Weeks 3-4: Medium Mastery**

Shift to Medium-difficulty problems. Focus on arrays and sorting first — IBM loves problems where sorting the input reveals the solution. Then layer in two-pointer and hash table patterns. Aim for 2 to 3 mediums per day with a 30-minute time limit each. Practice writing clean, readable code; IBM values code quality. Include comments and use meaningful variable names even in practice.

**Week 5: HackerRank Simulation**

Simulate IBM's online assessment format. Set a timer for 90 minutes and attempt 3 to 4 problems of mixed difficulty. Practice on HackerRank specifically if possible, since the platform's input/output format and testing environment differ from LeetCode. Get comfortable with standard I/O handling in your language of choice. For example, know how to read multiple lines of input until EOF.

**Week 6: Technical Depth and Review**

IBM interviews often include questions about your technical background, your understanding of data structures, and theoretical computer science concepts. Review hash table collision resolution, sorting algorithm properties, tree and graph basics, and Big-O analysis. Spend three days on this and three days revisiting coding problems you found difficult. Be able to walk through the step-by-step execution of an algorithm on a whiteboard.

## Key Tips

1. **Ace the online assessment.** IBM's HackerRank round is a hard gate — if you do not pass it, you will not get to the interview stage. Practice specifically on HackerRank's platform to get familiar with their editor, test case format, and submission process. Time management is critical; don't get stuck on one problem.

2. **Lean on sorting as a strategy.** Many IBM problems become much simpler after sorting the input. When you see an array problem and your first instinct is a hash map, also consider whether sorting plus two pointers or binary search gives a cleaner solution. For example, the "Two Sum" problem can be solved with a hash map in O(n) time, but if you need to find all unique pairs, sorting and using two pointers might be more efficient and avoid extra space.

3. **Know your computer science fundamentals.** IBM technical interviews may ask you to explain the internals of a hash map, the difference between stable and unstable sorts, or how a binary search tree maintains balance. Be ready to discuss data structures at a conceptual level, not just use them. You might be asked to implement a basic version of these structures.

4. **Prepare for domain-specific questions.** Depending on the team — whether it is cloud infrastructure, AI, or quantum computing — IBM may ask questions related to your area of expertise. Research the specific team you are interviewing for and review relevant technical concepts. For cloud roles, understand basic networking and distributed systems principles. For AI, know machine learning fundamentals.

5. **Do not over-prepare on Hard problems.** With only 9% of questions at Hard difficulty, your time is better spent perfecting your Medium-problem execution speed and accuracy. A candidate who solves two Mediums flawlessly will outperform one who struggles through a Hard. Focus on robustness and edge case handling for Medium problems.

### Example Problem: Two Sum (Using Hash Table and Two Pointers)

This classic problem illustrates the choice between a hash table approach and a two-pointer approach after sorting. The hash table method is optimal for finding a single pair, while the two-pointer method is useful when the array is sorted and you need to find all pairs or the array is already sorted.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Hash Table Solution (Optimal for unsorted array, O(n) time)
def two_sum_hash(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # No solution

# Two Pointer Solution (Requires sorted array, O(n log n) time for sort)
def two_sum_two_pointers(nums, target):
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)  # Creates a sorted copy
    left, right = 0, len(nums_sorted) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_sorted[left] + nums_sorted[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            # Find original indices (simplified, assumes unique values for demo)
            idx1 = nums.index(nums_sorted[left])
            # Handle case where same value appears twice
            idx2 = nums.index(nums_sorted[right], idx1 + 1) if nums_sorted[left] == nums_sorted[right] else nums.index(nums_sorted[right])
            return sorted([idx1, idx2])
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Hash Table Solution (Optimal for unsorted array, O(n) time)
function twoSumHash(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution
}

// Two Pointer Solution (Requires sorted array, O(n log n) time for sort)
function twoSumTwoPointers(nums, target) {
  // Create an array of objects to preserve original indices
  const indexedNums = nums.map((num, idx) => ({ num, idx }));
  indexedNums.sort((a, b) => a.num - b.num);

  let left = 0,
    right = indexedNums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = indexedNums[left].num + indexedNums[right].num;
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [indexedNums[left].idx, indexedNums[right].idx].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

// Hash Table Solution (Optimal for unsorted array, O(n) time)
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSumHash(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { numMap.get(complement), i };
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {}; // No solution
    }

    // Two Pointer Solution (Requires sorted array, O(n log n) time for sort)
    public int[] twoSumTwoPointers(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Create an array of indices and sort based on values
        Integer[] indices = new Integer[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) indices[i] = i;

        Arrays.sort(indices, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(nums[a], nums[b]));

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int currentSum = nums[indices[left]] + nums[indices[right]];
            if (currentSum == target) {
                return new int[] { indices[left], indices[right] };
            } else if (currentSum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

### Example Problem: Removing Duplicates from Sorted Array (Two Pointers)

This is a classic two-pointer problem where you maintain one pointer for the position of the last unique element and another to scan through the array. It demonstrates in-place modification, which is common in IBM array problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # Pointer for the position of the last unique element
    unique_pos = 0
    # Pointer to scan through the array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[unique_pos]:
            unique_pos += 1
            nums[unique_pos] = nums[i]
    # Length of the array with unique elements is unique_pos + 1
    return unique_pos + 1

# Example usage:
# nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
# new_length = remove_duplicates(nums)
# nums[:new_length] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  // Pointer for the position of the last unique element
  let uniquePos = 0;
  // Pointer to scan through the array
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[uniquePos]) {
      uniquePos++;
      nums[uniquePos] = nums[i];
    }
  }
  // Length of the array with unique elements is uniquePos + 1
  return uniquePos + 1;
}

// Example usage:
// let nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
// let newLength = removeDuplicates(nums);
// nums.slice(0, newLength) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```java
public class RemoveDuplicates {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        // Pointer for the position of the last unique element
        int uniquePos = 0;
        // Pointer to scan through the array
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[uniquePos]) {
                uniquePos++;
                nums[uniquePos] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        // Length of the array with unique elements is uniquePos + 1
        return uniquePos + 1;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// int[] nums = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5};
// int newLength = new RemoveDuplicates().removeDuplicates(nums);
// Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, newLength) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Example Problem: Custom Sorting (Comparator Usage)

IBM often asks problems requiring custom sorting logic. For example, sorting strings by length, or sorting numbers by the number of 1s in their binary representation. Understanding how to write custom comparators is essential.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Sort strings by length, then alphabetically
def sort_strings(strings):
    # Sort by length first (primary key), then by the string itself (secondary key)
    return sorted(strings, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))

# Sort integers by the number of 1s in their binary representation
def sort_by_bit_count(nums):
    # Precompute bit counts or use bin(x).count('1')
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))

# Example:
# strings = ["apple", "cat", "banana", "dog", "elephant"]
# sorted_strings = sort_strings(strings) -> ['cat', 'dog', 'apple', 'banana', 'elephant']
# nums = [3, 7, 8, 9]  # binary: 11, 111, 1000, 1001 -> bit counts: 2,3,1,2
# sorted_nums = sort_by_bit_count(nums) -> [8, 3, 9, 7] (bit counts: 1,2,2,3)
```

```javascript
// Sort strings by length, then alphabetically
function sortStrings(strings) {
  return strings.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.length !== b.length) {
      return a.length - b.length;
    }
    return a.localeCompare(b);
  });
}

// Sort integers by the number of 1s in their binary representation
function countBits(x) {
  let count = 0;
  while (x > 0) {
    count += x & 1;
    x >>= 1;
  }
  return count;
}

function sortByBitCount(nums) {
  return nums.sort((a, b) => {
    const bitCountA = countBits(a);
    const bitCountB = countBits(b);
    if (bitCountA !== bitCountB) {
      return bitCountA - bitCountB;
    }
    return a - b;
  });
}

// Example:
// let strings = ["apple", "cat", "banana", "dog", "elephant"];
// let sortedStrings = sortStrings(strings); // -> ['cat', 'dog', 'apple', 'banana', 'elephant']
// let nums = [3, 7, 8, 9]; // binary: 11, 111, 1000, 1001 -> bit counts: 2,3,1,2
// let sortedNums = sortByBitCount(nums); // -> [8, 3, 9, 7] (bit counts: 1,2,2,3)
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CustomSorting {
    // Sort strings by length, then alphabetically
    public List<String> sortStrings(List<String> strings) {
        strings.sort((a, b) -> {
            if (a.length() != b.length()) {
                return a.length() - b.length();
            }
            return a.compareTo(b);
        });
        return strings;
    }

    // Sort integers by the number of 1s in their binary representation
    private int countBits(int x) {
        int count = 0;
        while (x > 0) {
            count += x & 1;
            x >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public List<Integer> sortByBitCount(List<Integer> nums) {
        nums.sort((a, b) -> {
            int bitCountA = countBits(a);
            int bitCountB = countBits(b);
            if (bitCountA != bitCountB) {
                return bitCountA - bitCountB;
            }
            return a - b;
        });
        return nums;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("apple", "cat", "banana", "dog", "elephant");
// List<String> sortedStrings = new CustomSorting().sortStrings(strings); // -> ["cat", "dog", "apple", "banana", "elephant"]
// List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(3, 7, 8, 9); // binary: 11, 111, 1000, 1001 -> bit counts: 2,3,1,2
// List<Integer> sortedNums = new CustomSorting().sortByBitCount(nums); // -> [8, 3, 9, 7]
```

</div>

### Example Problem: Hash Table for Frequency Counting

A common use of hash tables is to count frequencies of elements. This pattern is used in problems like finding the first non-repeating character or checking if two strings are anagrams.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Find the first non-repeating character in a string
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    freq = {}
    # First pass: count frequencies
    for ch in s:
        freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1
    # Second pass: find first character with frequency 1
    for ch in s:
        if freq[ch] == 1:
            return ch
    return None  # or empty string

# Check if two strings are anagrams
def are_anagrams(s1, s2):
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False
    freq = {}
    # Count frequencies in s1
    for ch in s1:
        freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1
    # Decrement frequencies based on s2
    for ch in s2:
        if ch not in freq or freq[ch] == 0:
            return False
        freq[ch] -= 1
    return True

# Example:
# first_non_repeating_char("swiss") -> 'w'
# are_anagrams("listen", "silent") -> True
```

```javascript
// Find the first non-repeating character in a string
function firstNonRepeatingChar(s) {
  const freq = new Map();
  // First pass: count frequencies
  for (const ch of s) {
    freq.set(ch, (freq.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Second pass: find first character with frequency 1
  for (const ch of s) {
    if (freq.get(ch) === 1) {
      return ch;
    }
  }
  return null; // or empty string
}

// Check if two strings are anagrams
function areAnagrams(s1, s2) {
  if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
  const freq = new Map();
  // Count frequencies in s1
  for (const ch of s1) {
    freq.set(ch, (freq.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Decrement frequencies based on s2
  for (const ch of s2) {
    if (!freq.has(ch) || freq.get(ch) === 0) {
      return false;
    }
    freq.set(ch, freq.get(ch) - 1);
  }
  return true;
}

// Example:
// firstNonRepeatingChar("swiss") -> 'w'
// areAnagrams("listen", "silent") -> true
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class HashTableExamples {
    // Find the first non-repeating character in a string
    public Character firstNonRepeatingChar(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        // First pass: count frequencies
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(ch, freq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        // Second pass: find first character with frequency 1
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (freq.get(ch) == 1) {
                return ch;
            }
        }
        return null; // or empty character
    }

    // Check if two strings are anagrams
    public boolean areAnagrams(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        // Count frequencies in s1
        for (char ch : s1.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(ch, freq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        // Decrement frequencies based on s2
        for (char ch : s2.toCharArray()) {
            if (!freq.containsKey(ch) || freq.get(ch) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            freq.put(ch, freq.get(ch) - 1);
        }
        return true;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// new HashTableExamples().firstNonRepeatingChar("swiss") -> 'w'
// new HashTableExamples().areAnagrams("listen", "silent") -> true
```
