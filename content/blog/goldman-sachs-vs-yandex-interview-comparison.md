When preparing for technical interviews at top firms, understanding the specific focus and difficulty of their question banks can dramatically improve your efficiency. Goldman Sachs and Yandex, while both prestigious, present distinct profiles in their coding interview preparation resources on TidyBit. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you strategize your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Goldman Sachs's question bank is significantly larger and more challenging overall. With 270 total questions, it nearly doubles Yandex's 134. The difficulty distribution reveals a key strategic difference.

- **Goldman Sachs (270q): E51/M171/H48**
  The majority of questions (171) are tagged as Medium difficulty. The Hard count (48) is substantial, nearly five times larger than Yandex's. This indicates that preparing for Goldman Sachs requires deep comfort with complex problem-solving and optimization, going beyond just implementing standard patterns.

- **Yandex (134q): E52/M72/H10**
  The distribution here is more balanced between Easy and Medium, with a much smaller pool of Hard questions (only 10). This suggests Yandex's technical screen might place a stronger emphasis on foundational correctness, speed, and clean implementation of common algorithms, with fewer extreme optimization puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form a crucial common foundation. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The primary divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic:

- **Goldman Sachs** emphasizes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with its higher volume of Hard questions, as DP problems often test advanced state definition and optimization. You must be proficient in classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, LIS) and comfortable deriving recurrence relations.
- **Yandex** emphasizes **Two Pointers**. This technique is fundamental for solving a wide range of Medium-difficulty problems efficiently, particularly those involving sorted arrays, linked lists, or sliding windows. It tests your ability to manipulate indices and reason about multiple positions in a sequence.

Here is a classic Two Pointers problem, highly relevant for Yandex:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

In contrast, a foundational DP problem for Goldman Sachs would be something like climbing stairs or minimum path sum.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Yandex's profile**. Its strong focus on Array, String, Hash Table, and Two Pointers covers the absolute essentials of algorithmic interviewing. Mastering these will build a robust foundation for solving a high percentage of Easy and Medium problems across any question bank. The smaller number of Hard questions allows you to solidify core patterns without initially getting bogged down in the most complex DP or graph problems.

After conquering the Yandex core, transition to **Goldman Sachs preparation**. This becomes an exercise in scale and depth. You will need to:

1.  **Solve a much larger volume** of Medium problems to build stamina and speed.
2.  **Systematically study Dynamic Programming** to tackle its significant Hard question set.
3.  **Practice problem decomposition** on more complex, multi-step questions that are characteristic of the higher difficulty distribution.

Effectively, preparing for Goldman Sachs encompasses the Yandex foundation and then adds a heavy layer of additional complexity and breadth. Using the Yandex topics as a starting point creates a logical and efficient progression in your interview preparation journey.
