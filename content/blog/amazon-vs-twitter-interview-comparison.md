When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Amazon and Twitter (now X) represent two distinct archetypes in the coding interview landscape: one with a massive, well-documented repository of questions and another with a smaller, more curated set. A strategic comparison reveals how to tailor your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is scale. Amazon's list of nearly 2000 questions is one of the largest available, indicating a vast and frequently recycled question pool. The difficulty distribution (E530/M1057/H351) shows a heavy emphasis on **Medium** problems, which form the core of their on-site interviews. You can expect questions that test a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms under moderate time constraints.

In stark contrast, Twitter's list is much smaller, with only 53 questions. The distribution (E8/M33/H12) also skews heavily toward Medium difficulty. This smaller pool suggests that while questions may be recycled, the focus is less on sheer volume and more on specific problem-solving approaches or design thinking. The limited number means each question in their list carries more relative weight in preparation.

**Key Takeaway:** For Amazon, breadth of practice across many Medium problems is crucial. For Twitter, depth of understanding on a smaller set of patterns is key.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are paramount for each, forming the basis for most interview questions.

- **Amazon** adds a significant focus on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with their leadership principles like "Dive Deep" and "Bias for Action," often tested through complex optimization problems. You must be prepared to break down a problem and build an efficient solution from the ground up.
- **Twitter** uniquely lists **Design** as a top topic. This reflects the company's product-centric engineering culture, where system design or object-oriented design questions are common even in coding rounds, especially for more senior roles.

Here is a typical array/hash table problem (Two Sum) common at both companies:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

An example of Amazon's DP focus would be a problem like "Longest Increasing Subsequence," while Twitter might follow a coding question with a design discussion about a feature like "Twitter's Trending Topics."

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Amazon**. Its enormous question bank covers a wider swath of the algorithmic domain you'll need for any interview. Mastering Amazon's emphasis on arrays, strings, hash tables, and dynamic programming will build a formidable foundation. The process of tackling a high volume of Medium-difficulty problems will sharpen your speed and pattern recognition, which is transferable to almost any other company, including Twitter.

Once comfortable with that broad base, pivot to **Twitter-specific preparation**. Drill into their smaller list of questions to understand their particular phrasing and potential twists. Most importantly, integrate **design practice**. For any Twitter interview, be ready to transition from writing efficient code to discussing scalable system architecture or clean object-oriented design.

In essence, Amazon prep builds your general algorithmic muscle; Twitter prep requires you to apply that muscle to more product-aware problems.
