Dynamic Programming (DP) is a core algorithmic technique for optimizing solutions to complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems. At JPMorgan, where systems must process vast amounts of financial data, execute trades efficiently, and manage risk in real-time, DP is not an academic exercise—it’s a practical tool. Engineers use it to optimize resource allocation, calculate optimal trading strategies, and model probabilistic outcomes. The 11 DP questions in their interview repertoire (out of 78 total) test a candidate's ability to move from brute-force thinking to efficient, scalable solutions. Mastering DP demonstrates you can handle the performance-critical and computationally intensive challenges inherent in large-scale financial systems.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

JPMorgan's DP questions typically fall into two categories, focusing on practical optimization rather than obscure puzzles.

**1. Classic Knapsack & Sequence Problems:** These are foundational. Expect variations of the "Knapsack" problem, which directly models capital allocation or portfolio optimization—how to select items (or investments) with given values and weights (or risks) to maximize value within a constraint. Sequence problems like "Longest Common Subsequence" or "Edit Distance" are also common, as they underpin data comparison, transaction reconciliation, and string processing tasks.

**2. Pathfinding & State Transition Problems:** These involve finding optimal paths or making sequential decisions. Problems like "Unique Paths," "Minimum Path Sum," or "House Robber" test your ability to model state transitions and cumulative optimization. They mirror real-world scenarios like navigating transaction dependencies or minimizing cost/risk across a series of steps.

The problems are designed to be approachable but require a clear, optimized DP solution. Interviewers will expect you to explain the recurrence relation, time/space complexity, and potential trade-offs.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by understanding the core patterns: **Memoization (top-down)** and **Tabulation (bottom-up)**. Learn to spot the "optimal substructure" (an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems) and "overlapping subproblems."

1.  **Identify the State:** What parameters define a subproblem? (e.g., current index, remaining capacity).
2.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:** The formula that relates the current state to previous states.
3.  **Choose an Implementation Strategy:** Often, starting with a recursive memoized solution is easier for understanding, then converting to an iterative tabulated one for optimal space.

**Example: Classic 0/1 Knapsack Problem**
Given weights, values, and a capacity, find the maximum total value you can carry.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    n = len(values)
    # dp[i][w] = max value using first i items with capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take item i-1
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip item i-1
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w] # Cannot take this item
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

```javascript
function knapsack(values, weights, capacity) {
  const n = values.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] values, int[] weights, int capacity) {
        int n = values.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                    int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

Do not jump into hard problems. Build competence sequentially.

1.  **Foundation:** Start with one-dimensional DP problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber). Master the state transition.
2.  **Core Patterns:** Practice the essential 2D patterns: 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, and Unbounded Knapsack (Coin Change).
3.  **Pathfinding:** Solve grid-based problems (Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum).
4.  **JPMorgan-Specific:** Finally, tackle problems tagged for JPMorgan on platforms like TidyBit. This focuses your effort on their known question bank.

Consistency is key. Solve at least one DP problem daily, and always verbalize your reasoning—this is what you'll do in the interview.
