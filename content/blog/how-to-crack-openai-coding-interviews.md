OpenAI’s technical interviews are designed to assess not just raw algorithmic skill, but also the ability to design robust, scalable systems and reason through complex, often novel, problems. While the exact process can vary, candidates typically face a mix of coding rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, and system design or research-oriented discussions. The coding portion is a critical filter, and the data from recent interviews reveals a clear pattern for how to prepare effectively.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 15 recent OpenAI coding questions shows a distinct distribution: **2 Easy (13%), 11 Medium (73%), and 2 Hard (13%)**. This breakdown is highly instructive. The overwhelming focus on Medium-difficulty problems indicates that interviewers are testing for strong fundamentals and the ability to apply core patterns to non-trivial scenarios. You won't be wasting time on trivial `fizzbuzz` problems, but you also likely won't face the most esoteric, competition-level Hard problems. The two Hard problems serve as differentiators, often testing advanced graph algorithms, complex dynamic programming, or intricate design under constraints. Your goal is to master the Medium tier to pass the bar, and then tackle a subset of Hard patterns to excel.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five dominant areas. Prioritize these in your study.

- **Array:** The most frequent topic. Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, subarray sums, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Stack:** A critical data structure for problems involving nested structures, parsing, and monotonic properties (like next greater element).
- **Design:** This is a standout for OpenAI. It often refers to designing data structures like LRU caches, Tic-Tac-Toe, or other object-oriented systems with specific APIs.
- **Matrix:** Problems involve traversal (spiral, diagonal), search (sorted matrix), or dynamic programming on grids.
- **String:** Common operations include palindrome checks, anagram grouping, and substring searches, often requiring hash maps or two pointers.

For a top pattern like **Design**, the most important concept is often designing a data structure that combines a hash map for O(1) access with another structure (like a doubly linked list) to maintain order. Here is the classic LRU Cache implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key=0, val=0):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.cap = capacity
        self.cache = {}
        self.left, self.right = ListNode(), ListNode()
        self.left.next, self.right.prev = self.right, self.left

    def _remove(self, node):
        prev, nxt = node.prev, node.next
        prev.next, nxt.prev = nxt, prev

    def _insert(self, node):
        prev, nxt = self.right.prev, self.right
        prev.next = nxt.prev = node
        node.prev, node.next = prev, nxt

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            self._remove(self.cache[key])
            self._insert(self.cache[key])
            return self.cache[key].val
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self._remove(self.cache[key])
        self.cache[key] = ListNode(key, value)
        self._insert(self.cache[key])
        if len(self.cache) > self.cap:
            lru = self.left.next
            self._remove(lru)
            del self.cache[lru.key]
```

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(key, val) {
    this.key = key;
    this.val = val;
    this.prev = null;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LRUCache {

    this.cap = capacity;
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.left = new ListNode(0, 0);
    this.right = new ListNode(0, 0);
    this.left.next = this.right;
    this.right.prev = this.left;
  }

  _remove(node) {
    const prev = node.prev;
    const nxt = node.next;
    prev.next = nxt;
    nxt.prev = prev;

  _insert(node) {

    const nxt = this.right;
    prev.next = nxt.prev = node;
    node.prev = prev;
    node.next = nxt;
  }

  get(key) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      const node = this.cache.get(key);
      this._remove(node);
      this._insert(node);
      return node.val;
    }
    return -1;
  }

  put(key, value) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      this._remove(this.cache.get(key));
    }
    const newNode = new ListNode(key, value);
    this.cache.set(key, newNode);
    this._insert(newNode);
    if (this.cache.size > this.cap) {
      const lru = this.left.next;
      this._remove(lru);
      this.cache.delete(lru.key);
    }
  }
}
```

```java
class LRUCache {
    class Node {
        int key, val;
        Node prev, next;
        Node(int k, int v) { key = k; val = v; }
    }

    private void remove(Node node) {
        Node prev = node.prev;
        Node nxt = node.next;
        prev.next = nxt;

    private Map<Integer, Node> cache = new HashMap<>();
    private int cap;
    private Node head, tail;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        cap = capacity;

        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            Node node = cache.get(key);
            remove(node);
            insert(node);
            return node.val;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            remove(cache.get(key));
        }
        Node newNode = new Node(key, value);
        cache.put(key, newNode);
        insert(newNode);
        if (cache.size() > cap) {
            Node lru = head.next;
            remove(lru);

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Stack, Design, Matrix, String), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Focus on internalizing the pattern, not just solving. For example, for Arrays, ensure you can implement two-pointer and sliding window solutions from memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Mock Interviews.** Start mixing problems from different topics. Practice solving Medium problems within 25 minutes. Begin tackling the Hard problems, focusing on understanding the solution approach rather than brute-force memorization. Do at least 2-3 mock interviews per week under timed conditions.

**Weeks 5-6: Refinement & Company-Specific Prep.** Revisit your problem log and re-solve any you struggled with. Deep dive into "Design" problems, as they are a signature area for OpenAI. Practice explaining your thought process aloud for every problem you solve. In the final days, focus on rest and mental preparation, not cramming.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process Relentlessly.** OpenAI values clarity of thought. Narrate your assumptions, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and explain your code as you write it. Silence is a red flag.
2.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Write clean, modular code with clear variable names. A correct, readable Medium solution is better than a buggy, "clever" one. Comment on time/space complexity.
3.  **Don't Ignore the "Easy" Problems.** They may seem trivial, but they are often used to assess coding hygiene, attention to detail, and communication under low stress. A sloppy "Easy" solve can break trust.
4.  **Test Your Code with Edge Cases.** Before declaring a problem solved, verbally run through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicates. Proactively catching a bug is impressive.
5.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before diving in, confirm the function signature, input constraints, and expected output. It shows you think about the problem space and API design.

Success in an OpenAI coding interview is built on a foundation of mastered Medium patterns, clear communication, and thoughtful design. Target your preparation on the high-frequency areas, and practice articulating your reasoning every step of the way.
