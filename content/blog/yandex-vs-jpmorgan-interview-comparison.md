When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of your target companies can dramatically improve your efficiency. Yandex, a major Russian tech giant, and JPMorgan Chase, a leading global financial institution, represent two distinct sectors: pure technology and finance-driven technology. While both assess core algorithmic skills, their interview question profiles reveal different priorities in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a clear difference in the sheer volume of documented questions. Yandex's repository of **134 questions** significantly outnumbers JPMorgan's **78 questions**. This suggests Yandex's technical interviews may draw from a broader, more extensive problem bank, requiring wider preparation.

Breaking down by difficulty:

- **Yandex:** 52 Easy (39%), 72 Medium (54%), 10 Hard (7%)
- **JPMorgan:** 25 Easy (32%), 45 Medium (58%), 8 Hard (10%)

Both companies have a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty** problems, which form the core of their interviews. However, Yandex presents a slightly higher volume of Easy questions, which could indicate more initial screening questions or a wider range of candidate levels. The proportion of Hard problems is similar and relatively low for both, suggesting these are likely reserved for more advanced roles or final-round interviews. The key takeaway is that mastering Medium problems is the most critical task for either company.

## Topic Overlap

The core technical topics are nearly identical, highlighting the universal importance of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

**Primary Shared Topics:** Array, String, Hash Table.
These are the absolute essentials. You must be proficient in manipulating arrays and strings, and using hash tables (dictionaries/maps) for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

**Key Differentiator:** Yandex explicitly lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic, while JPMorgan lists **Sorting**.
This nuance is revealing. Two Pointers is a technique often used for problems involving sorted arrays, linked lists, or sliding windows (e.g., finding a pair with a target sum, removing duplicates, substring problems). Its prominence at Yandex points to an interview style that deeply tests in-place array/string manipulation and optimization.

```python
# Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array in-place (Yandex-style)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array in-place (Yandex-style)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers example: Removing duplicates from sorted array in-place (Yandex-style)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

JPMorgan's focus on **Sorting** indicates a strong expectation that candidates understand comparison-based sorts (QuickSort, MergeSort) and can leverage sorting as a pre-processing step to simplify problems, which is a common pattern in financial data processing.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Sorting as a pre-processing step (JPMorgan-style)
def findMinDifference(timePoints):
    # Convert times to minutes and sort
    minutes = sorted([int(t[:2]) * 60 + int(t[3:]) for t in timePoints])
    # Find minimum difference between consecutive sorted times
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(minutes)):
        min_diff = min(min_diff, minutes[i] - minutes[i-1])
    # Check circular difference
    min_diff = min(min_diff, (1440 + minutes[0]) - minutes[-1])
    return min_diff
```

```javascript
// Sorting as a pre-processing step (JPMorgan-style)
function findMinDifference(timePoints) {
  // Convert times to minutes and sort
  const minutes = timePoints
    .map((t) => parseInt(t.substring(0, 2)) * 60 + parseInt(t.substring(3)))
    .sort((a, b) => a - b);
  // Find minimum difference between consecutive sorted times
  let minDiff = Infinity;
  for (let i = 1; i < minutes.length; i++) {
    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1]);
  }
  // Check circular difference
  minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, 1440 + minutes[0] - minutes[minutes.length - 1]);
  return minDiff;
}
```

```java
// Sorting as a pre-processing step (JPMorgan-style)
public int findMinDifference(List<String> timePoints) {
    // Convert times to minutes and sort
    int[] minutes = new int[timePoints.size()];
    for (int i = 0; i < timePoints.size(); i++) {
        String t = timePoints.get(i);
        minutes[i] = Integer.parseInt(t.substring(0, 2)) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(t.substring(3));
    }
    Arrays.sort(minutes);
    // Find minimum difference between consecutive sorted times
    int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 1; i < minutes.length; i++) {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1]);
    }
    // Check circular difference
    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, (1440 + minutes[0]) - minutes[minutes.length - 1]);
    return minDiff;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are targeting both types of companies, **start with JPMorgan's profile**. Here’s why:

1.  **Foundation First:** Its slightly smaller question set and strong focus on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting build a perfect, manageable foundation. Mastering these will cover a vast majority of Yandex's requirements as well.
2.  **Efficient Overlap:** The core topics are the same. By preparing for JPMorgan, you automatically cover the essential ground for Yandex.
3.  **Add Technique Later:** Once comfortable with the shared fundamentals, you can layer on the specific **Two Pointers** technique emphasized by Yandex. This is more efficient than trying to learn everything from the larger Yandex problem set immediately.

In short, use the JPMorgan list to build core competency efficiently, then expand your practice to include Two Pointers problems and the broader Yandex question bank to cover the tech-focused depth.
