When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and focus areas of each can dramatically increase your efficiency. Roblox and Twitter (now X) are both prominent platforms, but their engineering interviews reflect different product priorities. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Both companies maintain a similar total number of tagged questions on TidyBit, with Roblox at 56 and Twitter at 53. Their difficulty distributions are nearly identical, heavily weighted toward medium problems.

- **Roblox:** 56 questions (Easy: 8, Medium: 36, Hard: 12)
- **Twitter:** 53 questions (Easy: 8, Medium: 33, Hard: 12)

This parity suggests the overall intellectual rigor required is comparable. You must be highly proficient with medium-difficulty problems that require combining 2-3 core concepts to arrive at an optimal solution. The similar hard count indicates both will test advanced algorithmic thinking for senior roles.

```python
# Example of a typical "Medium" combination problem (Array + Hash Table)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example of a typical "Medium" combination problem (Array + Hash Table)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example of a typical "Medium" combination problem (Array + Hash Table)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Topic Overlap

The fundamental technical screening for both roles rests on a nearly identical core.

- **Shared Core:** **Array, Hash Table, and String** problems form the absolute foundation for both companies. Mastery here is non-negotiable. Expect questions that involve manipulation, searching, and efficient lookups using these data structures.
- **Key Differentiator:** The most significant divergence is in Twitter's inclusion of **Design** as a top-tagged topic. This reflects Twitter's scale and the system design challenges inherent in building a global, real-time social media platform. Roblox's top tags include **Math**, hinting at a greater focus on game-adjacent logic, simulations, or physics calculations.

This means:

- For **Roblox**, drill into problems involving mathematical reasoning, geometry, or probability within your algorithms.
- For **Twitter**, you must prepare for both algorithmic rounds **and** system design interviews, which will cover scalable architecture for feeds, notifications, and real-time updates.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the shared foundation. The overlap in Array, Hash Table, and String questions is so substantial that preparing for one company directly benefits preparation for the other.

1.  **Build the Core First:** Solve the easy and medium problems for Array, Hash Table, and String from either company's list. This builds the muscle memory for data structure manipulation that is essential for both.
2.  **Branch Based on Your Target:**
    - If targeting **Twitter**, pivot early to **Design** practice (e.g., design Twitter, design a URL shortener) after solidifying the core algorithms.
    - If targeting **Roblox**, incorporate more **Math**-tagged problems and consider exploring graph algorithms (common in game logic) beyond the top tags.
3.  **Practice Hard Problems:** Finally, tackle the hard problems from your target company to prepare for the depth required in later interview stages.

By mastering the common algorithmic core, you create a versatile base. You can then layer on the specialized knowledge—system design for Twitter or mathematical algorithms for Roblox—to become target-ready.
