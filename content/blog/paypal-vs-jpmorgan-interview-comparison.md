When preparing for technical interviews at major companies, understanding their specific focus areas can dramatically increase your efficiency. PayPal and JPMorgan Chase (JPMorgan) represent two distinct sectors—fintech and traditional finance—yet their technical interviews share significant common ground. A direct comparison of their question profiles reveals clear priorities in volume, difficulty, and core topics, allowing you to tailor your study plan effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a clear difference in both the number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

PayPal's profile, with **106 total questions**, indicates a broader and potentially more rigorous coding interview process. The difficulty breakdown is **18 Easy, 69 Medium, and 19 Hard** questions. This skew towards Medium and Hard problems (over 83% combined) suggests that PayPal interviews are designed to test strong algorithmic problem-solving skills under pressure. You should expect to encounter complex scenarios that require optimized solutions.

JPMorgan's profile is smaller at **78 total questions**, with a notably different difficulty spread: **25 Easy, 45 Medium, and 8 Hard**. While Medium problems still dominate (58%), the higher proportion of Easy questions and significantly lower number of Hard questions indicates that JPMorgan's technical screen might place a greater emphasis on foundational correctness, clean code, and logical reasoning, rather than on solving the most algorithmically complex problems. The bar is still high, but the focus may differ.

## Topic Overlap

Despite their different sectors, the core technical topics for both companies are nearly identical, centering on fundamental data structures.

The top topics for both are:

1.  **Array**
2.  **String**
3.  **Hash Table**
4.  **Sorting**

This massive overlap is your strategic advantage. Mastering these four areas will build a foundation applicable to both interview processes. Problems in these categories often involve manipulation, searching, and efficient data lookup. For example, a classic problem that could appear at either company is the Two Sum problem, which perfectly combines Array and Hash Table usage.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the analysis, your preparation sequence should be guided by the **foundation-first principle**.

Start by mastering the shared core: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting**. Drill problems on these topics, focusing on writing bug-free, efficient code. This core study will effectively prepare you for the majority of JPMorgan's question profile and a significant portion of PayPal's.

If you are interviewing at both, **prioritize a deep dive into PayPal's question list after solidifying the fundamentals**. The higher volume and greater concentration of Medium/Hard problems mean you'll need extra practice with more complex algorithmic thinking, dynamic programming, and tree/graph problems that often accompany those core topics. Succeeding in PayPal-style interviews will inherently cover the skill level needed for JPMorgan.

If you are only targeting one company, tailor your effort: for **PayPal**, emphasize pattern recognition and optimization for challenging problems; for **JPMorgan**, ensure flawless execution on fundamentals and practice clearly explaining your thought process.
