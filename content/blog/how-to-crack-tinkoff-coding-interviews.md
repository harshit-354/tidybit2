Tinkoff coding interviews test practical problem-solving skills with a strong emphasis on algorithmic efficiency and clean code. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including an online assessment and technical interviews where you'll solve problems on a shared editor. Success hinges on a focused understanding of the specific patterns and topics they favor.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 27 Tinkoff interview questions reveals a clear pattern: **67% (18 questions) are Medium difficulty, and 33% (9 questions) are Easy. There are no Hard problems.** This distribution is critical for your preparation strategy.

It means Tinkoff prioritizes **foundational mastery and speed** over esoteric, complex algorithms. You won't need to grind advanced graph theory or dynamic programming puzzles. Instead, you must become exceptionally proficient at applying core data structures and techniques to common, practical problems. The expectation is to solve a Medium problem correctly and efficiently within the interview timeframe, demonstrating both logical thinking and coding fluency. Missing edge cases or writing messy code on an Easy problem can be just as disqualifying as failing a Hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of topics. Master these, and you'll be prepared for the vast majority of problems.

- **Array:** The most frequent topic. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations. Key patterns include prefix sum and sliding window.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems. Focus on two-pointer techniques for reversal/palindromes, character counting with hash maps, and string builders for efficient manipulation.
- **Hash Table:** The essential tool for achieving O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. Used for frequency counting, deduplication, and complement searching (like in Two Sum).
- **Two Pointers:** A fundamental technique for optimizing solutions on sorted arrays or strings. Crucial for problems involving pair searching, deduplication, or merging.
- **Matrix:** A 2D extension of array problems. Master traversal patterns—spiral, diagonal, layer-by-layer—and in-place rotation/transposition.

The most important combined pattern is using a **Hash Table with a Two Pointer or Array traversal** to find pairs or subarrays that meet a condition. Here is the classic "Two Sum" implementation, demonstrating this core pattern.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash Table: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]  # Found the pair
        seen[num] = i  # Store the current number and its index
    return []  # No solution found
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash Table: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i]; // Found the pair
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i); // Store the current number and its index
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash Table: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i}; // Found the pair
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i); // Store the current number and its index
    }
    return new int[]{}; // No solution found
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-based approach is optimal given Tinkoff's clear focus areas.

**Weeks 1-2: Core Foundation**
Dedicate one week to **Array** and **Hash Table** problems. Solve 15-20 problems, ensuring you can implement patterns like sliding window and frequency maps without hesitation. In the second week, focus on **String** and **Two Pointers**. Practice problems that combine these, like checking for palindromes or merging sorted arrays.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Matrix**
Tackle **Matrix** problems. Practice writing bug-free traversals. Spend the rest of your time on mixed-topic Medium problems that combine the core areas (e.g., an array problem that requires a hash table for efficiency). This is where your skills solidify.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Speed**
Stop learning new topics. Use the final two weeks for timed practice. Simulate the interview environment: solve 2-3 Medium problems in 60 minutes, explaining your thought process out loud. Focus on clarity, edge case handling, and writing production-ready code from the first line.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize from the Start.** For Tinkoff, a brute-force solution is rarely the end goal. When you hear an Array or String problem, immediately consider if a Hash Table or Two Pointers can bring it to O(n). Mention this trade-off to your interviewer.
2.  **Practice In-Place Operations.** Many Tinkoff array problems involve modifying the input array to save space. Become comfortable with swaps, overwriting indexes, and using the input array itself as a data structure when possible.
3.  **Clarify, Then Code.** Before writing a single line, ask detailed questions about input size, value ranges, and edge cases (empty input, negative numbers, duplicates). This demonstrates professional habits and prevents major logic errors.
4.  **Write Verbose, Readable Code.** Use descriptive variable names (`seen`, `complement`, `leftPtr`) and add brief inline comments for complex logic. The interviewer must be able to follow your solution easily. Avoid clever one-liners that obfuscate intent.

Master these focused topics, practice under time pressure, and communicate your thinking clearly. This targeted approach is how you crack the Tinkoff coding interview.
