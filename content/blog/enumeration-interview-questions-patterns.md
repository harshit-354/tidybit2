Enumeration questions test your ability to systematically generate, iterate through, or count all possible configurations of a problem. While brute force is often the starting point, interviewers assess your skill in optimizing this process—pruning invalid states early, using backtracking to explore possibilities efficiently, and applying combinatorial logic to avoid unnecessary work. Mastering these problems demonstrates core algorithmic thinking and attention to detail, which is why they appear in over 100 questions on our platform.

## Common Patterns

The key to enumeration is recognizing the underlying pattern, which dictates your search strategy.

**1. Backtracking (State Space Search)**
This is the most frequent pattern. You recursively build a candidate solution (e.g., a subset, permutation, or board configuration) and abandon it ("backtrack") as soon as it violates constraints. This prunes entire branches of the search tree.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def backtrack(path, choices):
    if is_solution(path):
        output.append(path[:]) # store a copy
        return
    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(choice):
            make_choice(path, choice)
            backtrack(path, new_choices)
            undo_choice(path, choice)

# Example: Generate all subsets
def subsets(nums):
    res = []
    def dfs(i, path):
        res.append(path[:])
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            path.append(nums[j])
            dfs(j + 1, path)
            path.pop()
    dfs(0, [])
    return res
```

```javascript
function backtrack(path, choices) {
  if (isSolution(path)) {
    output.push([...path]); // store a copy
    return;
  }
  for (let choice of choices) {
    if (isValid(choice)) {
      makeChoice(path, choice);
      backtrack(path, newChoices);
      undoChoice(path, choice);
    }
  }
}

// Example: Generate all subsets
function subsets(nums) {
  const res = [];
  function dfs(i, path) {
    res.push([...path]);
    for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
      path.push(nums[j]);
      dfs(j + 1, path);
      path.pop();
    }
  }
  dfs(0, []);
  return res;
}
```

```java
public void backtrack(List<Integer> path, List<Integer> choices) {
    if (isSolution(path)) {
        output.add(new ArrayList<>(path)); // store a copy
        return;
    }
    for (Integer choice : choices) {
        if (isValid(choice)) {
            makeChoice(path, choice);
            backtrack(path, newChoices);
            undoChoice(path, choice);
        }
    }
}

// Example: Generate all subsets
public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
    List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
    void dfs(int i, List<Integer> path) {
        res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        for (int j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            path.add(nums[j]);
            dfs(j + 1, path);
            path.remove(path.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    dfs(0, new ArrayList<>());
    return res;
}
```

**2. Combinatorial Enumeration with Constraints**
Here, you count or generate arrangements (like permutations or combinations) under specific rules. The challenge is to incorporate constraints directly into the generation logic to avoid filtering results later.

**3. Iterative Bitmasking**
For problems involving subsets of a fixed set, each subset can be represented by a bitmask where the `i`-th bit indicates whether the `i`-th element is included. You can iterate through all `2^n` masks.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Enumerate all subsets using bitmask
nums = [1, 2, 3]
n = len(nums)
all_subsets = []
for mask in range(1 << n): # 0 to 2^n - 1
    subset = []
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i): # Check if i-th bit is set
            subset.append(nums[i])
    all_subsets.append(subset)
```

```javascript
// Enumerate all subsets using bitmask
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const n = nums.length;
const allSubsets = [];
for (let mask = 0; mask < 1 << n; mask++) {
  // 0 to 2^n - 1
  const subset = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (mask & (1 << i)) {
      // Check if i-th bit is set
      subset.push(nums[i]);
    }
  }
  allSubsets.push(subset);
}
```

```java
// Enumerate all subsets using bitmask
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
int n = nums.length;
List<List<Integer>> allSubsets = new ArrayList<>();
for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) { // 0 to 2^n - 1
    List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) { // Check if i-th bit is set
            subset.add(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    allSubsets.add(subset);
}
```

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 110 enumeration questions split as: **Easy (25, 23%), Medium (55, 50%), Hard (30, 27%)**. This distribution is critical for your study plan.

- **Easy (23%):** These are foundational. They test basic backtracking or simple iteration, often asking you to generate all permutations or subsets without complex constraints. Mastering these is non-negotiable; they are the building blocks.
- **Medium (50%):** This is the core battleground. Questions add significant constraints (e.g., "generate parentheses," "subsets with duplicates," "combination sum"). You must implement efficient pruning and handle edge cases like duplicates. Most interview questions fall here.
- **Hard (27%):** These combine enumeration with other advanced concepts like dynamic programming (e.g., counting unique structures), optimization (find the _best_ configuration, not all), or involve complex spatial reasoning (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku solver). They test depth of understanding and endurance.

The 50% medium prevalence means you should prioritize becoming proficient with medium-difficulty backtracking and combinatorial problems before tackling hards.

## Which Companies Ask Enumeration

Enumeration is a staple at companies that deeply assess algorithmic fundamentals. Top askers include:

- [Google](/company/google) - Frequently asks backtracking and combinatorial problems in phone and onsite rounds.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) - Common in online assessments and interviews for roles requiring systematic problem-solving.
- [Meta](/company/meta) - Often includes permutation/subset generation and constraint-based enumeration.
- [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) - Uses these questions to test clean, recursive implementation and state management.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) - Appears in interviews for roles dealing with data analysis and scenario generation.

## Study Tips

1.  **Start with the Template:** Internalize the backtracking skeleton code. Practice modifying just the `is_valid`, `make_choice`, and `undo_choice` parts for different problems. Muscle memory here saves crucial time.
2.  **Draw the State Tree:** Before coding, sketch the decision tree for a small input. This visualizes the search space, clarifies where to prune, and helps you avoid duplicates.
3.  **Master Duplicate Handling:** A major pitfall in medium problems. Learn to sort inputs and skip identical choices at the same decision level (e.g., `if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue`).
4.  **Time Complexity Analysis:** Be ready to explain the O() of your enumeration. It's typically O(branching_factor^depth \* work_per_node). Understanding this helps you justify your approach and identify optimization opportunities.
