When preparing for technical interviews at Zoho and Accenture, a strategic approach involves understanding the distinct focus and expectations of each company's coding assessment. While both are major technology employers, their interview processes reflect different priorities in software development roles. Zoho, a product-based company, emphasizes algorithmic problem-solving to assess core engineering aptitude for building its software suites. Accenture, a global consulting and services firm, often focuses on foundational logic and data manipulation skills applicable to a wide range of client projects. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear patterns in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis that can guide your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Zoho's question bank is notably larger and more challenging. With 179 total questions, it presents a broader set of problems. The difficulty distribution—62 Easy, 97 Medium, and 20 Hard questions—shows a significant emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which often form the core of their technical screens. The presence of 20 Hard questions indicates that for certain roles, Zoho expects candidates to tackle complex algorithmic scenarios.

Accenture's bank is smaller at 144 questions and leans toward foundational concepts. Its distribution of 65 Easy, 68 Medium, and only 11 Hard questions highlights a focus on assessing competency and clear logical thinking rather than advanced algorithm optimization. The lower volume and reduced high-difficulty count suggest Accenture interviews may prioritize reliability, clarity, and practical application over solving esoteric algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, which are fundamental to most coding interviews. **Hash Table** usage is also critical for both, as it's the primary data structure for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

The key divergence is in the fourth major topic. Zoho includes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a clear signal that they value advanced problem-solving and optimization skills for recursive or combinatorial problems. Accenture replaces this with **Math**, focusing on numerical reasoning, basic arithmetic algorithms, and logical puzzles.

Here is a typical problem that might appear in both, solved using a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def find_pair_sum(arr, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: find_pair_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) returns [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function findPairSum(arr, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - arr[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(arr[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] findPairSum(int[] arr, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - arr[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(arr[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

A Zoho-specific DP problem might involve the classic "Climbing Stairs":

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

An Accentric Math problem could be checking for a prime number:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

```javascript
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false;
  if (n <= 3) return true;
  if (n % 2 === 0 || n % 3 === 0) return false;
  for (let i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
    if (n % i === 0 || n % (i + 2) === 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n <= 3) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Accenture first** if you are early in your interview preparation journey. Its focus on Easy and Medium Array, String, Hash Table, and Math problems provides a solid foundation. Mastering these will build the essential skills and confidence needed for most coding assessments. The relative absence of advanced Dynamic Programming lowers the initial barrier to entry.

Once comfortable with Accenture's scope, transition to **Zoho preparation**. This requires layering on the additional topic of Dynamic Programming and practicing a higher volume of Medium problems. The 20 Hard Zoho questions demand dedicated study of advanced algorithms and optimization techniques.

Effectively, preparing for Zoho will cover nearly all the technical ground needed for Accenture, plus the extra DP topic. The reverse is not true. Therefore, a logical sequence is to build core proficiency with Accenture's problem set, then extend your capability to meet Zoho's more rigorous demands.
