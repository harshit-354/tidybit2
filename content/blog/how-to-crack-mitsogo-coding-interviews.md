Mitsogo’s coding interviews are designed to assess strong foundational problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, followed by discussions on system design and behavioral fit. Success hinges on a targeted, efficient preparation strategy.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 16 recent Mitsogo coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 4 Easy (25%), 10 Medium (63%), and 2 Hard (13%). This breakdown is highly informative for candidates.

The overwhelming majority of questions are Medium difficulty. This indicates the primary goal is not to find academic researchers who can solve obscure puzzles, but to identify competent engineers who can reliably apply core computer science concepts to non-trivial, real-world adjacent problems. You must be exceptionally solid on standard algorithms and patterns. The presence of Hard questions means you should be prepared for at least one significant challenge that requires combining multiple concepts or employing advanced optimization. The 25% Easy questions often serve as warm-ups or are used to filter for basic coding competency. Do not underestimate them; a sloppy solution here can create a negative first impression.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Your study time is limited. Prioritize these high-frequency topics, which account for the bulk of Mitsogo's question pool.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving subarrays, sorting, searching, and in-place manipulations. Master prefix sums, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical topic for Medium and Hard problems. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Key patterns include 0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence, and DP on strings or arrays.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array and Two Pointers. Practice problems on palindromes, anagrams, subsequences, and string transformations. Know how to efficiently compare and manipulate strings.
- **Two Pointers:** An essential technique for optimizing solutions involving sequences (arrays, strings, linked lists). It's crucial for problems like finding pairs with a target sum, removing duplicates, or validating palindromes.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Appears less frequently but is a favorite for testing low-level understanding and clever problem-solving. Be comfortable with masks, XOR, and checking/setting individual bits.

The **Two Pointers** technique is particularly versatile and a must-know. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # `i` is the slow-runner, pointing to the last unique element.
    i = 0
    # `j` is the fast-runner, exploring new elements.
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    # New length is index of last unique element + 1.
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0; // slow-runner index
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1; // length of unique segment
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0; // slow pointer
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1; // new length
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Follow this plan, adjusting for your starting level.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers. Solve 15-20 problems on each topic, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Focus on understanding patterns, not memorizing solutions. Implement each solution from scratch.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & DP.** Tackle Dynamic Programming. Start with classic problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, 0/1 Knapsack) to grasp memoization and tabulation. Then move to string-based DP (LCS, Edit Distance). Concurrently, practice Bit Manipulation and revisit other topics with mixed problem sets.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new patterns. Focus exclusively on solving timed Medium-difficulty problems from a curated list (like TidyBit's company-specific questions). Simulate the interview environment: 30-45 minutes per problem, verbalizing your thought process, writing clean code, and testing edge cases. Complete at least 2-3 full mock interviews with a peer.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** From the moment you see the problem, talk. Explain your initial thoughts, discuss brute-force approaches, then optimize. Ask clarifying questions. A silent screen is your biggest enemy.
2.  **Optimize for Medium.** Since 63% of questions fall here, your default mindset should be to find a solution that is better than O(n²) brute force. Immediately consider if Hash Maps, Sets, Two Pointers, or Binary Search can be applied.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Don't just scribble pseudocode. Use proper variable names, handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values), and include brief comments if the logic is complex. Show you care about code quality.
4.  **Test Your Own Code.** Before declaring "done," walk through your code with a small sample input and a few edge cases. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches logical errors you can fix yourself.

Mastering these patterns and executing this disciplined strategy will dramatically increase your confidence and performance. For a targeted list of problems to practice, [browse all Mitsogo questions on TidyBit](/company/mitsogo).
