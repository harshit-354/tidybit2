Wells Fargo’s technical interviews for software engineering roles are a focused assessment of your core problem-solving and coding abilities. While the process may include multiple rounds, the coding portion typically centers on practical data structure and algorithm questions. Success hinges on methodical preparation targeting the specific patterns and difficulty levels they favor.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 24 recent Wells Fargo coding questions reveals a clear distribution: **Easy (42%)**, **Medium (50%)**, and **Hard (8%)**. This breakdown is critical for your strategy.

The high percentage of Easy and Medium questions means the primary gatekeeper is **consistent, clean execution**. You are not expected to solve obscure, complex graph problems under pressure. Instead, you must demonstrate flawless mastery of fundamentals—manipulating strings, traversing arrays, and using hash tables efficiently. The few Hard questions serve as tie-breakers for top candidates; you can secure an offer by dominating the Easy and Medium tiers. Your goal is to write bug-free, optimal solutions for the first two difficulty levels every single time.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **String & Array Manipulation:** The most frequent topics. Expect questions on searching, filtering, and transforming sequences of data.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often used in tandem with arrays or strings.
- **Two Pointers:** A fundamental pattern for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings with optimal space, such as finding pairs or removing duplicates.
- **Design:** A practical category that may involve designing data structures like a cache (LRU) or a parking lot system, testing OOP principles.

For the **Two Pointers** pattern, which is essential for optimal array solutions, here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # 'write' pointer places the next unique element
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write  # New length
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Follow this plan to build and reinforce the necessary skills.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition**

- Dedicate each day to one core data structure (Array, String, Hash Table, Linked List). Study its properties and the 2-3 most common patterns associated with it (e.g., Sliding Window for Arrays, Two Pointers for Sorted Arrays).
- For each pattern, solve 3-5 Easy and Medium problems from a curated list. Focus on understanding the template, not memorizing solutions.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Depth & Company Focus**

- Shift to solving Wells Fargo-specific and general banking-sector problems. Cluster your practice by the identified top topics.
- Simulate interview conditions: set a 30-minute timer, verbalize your thought process, and write code on a whiteboard or in a plain text editor.
- Begin integrating **Design** practice. Review object-oriented design principles and classic problems like LRU Cache.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gap Analysis**

- Conduct at least 3-5 full mock interviews with a peer or mentor. Use a mix of Easy and Medium questions.
- Analyze every mistake—was it a logical flaw, a syntax error, or a missed edge case? Systematically review weak topics.
- In the final days, revisit the most frequent patterns and ensure you can code them from scratch without hesitation.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A brute-force solution that works is better than an optimal one with bugs. State the brute force, then optimize. Wells Fargo interviewers value clear, working code.
2.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Narrate your thought process from the moment you see the question. Explain your approach, trade-offs, and why you chose a particular data structure. Silence is your biggest enemy.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through standard edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, and duplicates. This demonstrates professional thoroughness.
4.  **Know Your Hash Functions.** For design questions, be prepared to discuss how you would hash keys for a custom object and handle collisions, as this is a common follow-up.

Mastering these focused areas will position you strongly for the Wells Fargo interview. Consistent, pattern-based practice on the core topics is your most reliable path to success.
