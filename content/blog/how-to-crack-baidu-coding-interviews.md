Baidu’s coding interviews are a rigorous test of algorithmic problem-solving and system design, designed to identify engineers who can handle the scale and complexity of China’s leading search and AI company. The process typically involves multiple rounds, including phone screens, online coding assessments, and several on-site (or virtual) technical interviews focusing on data structures, algorithms, and real-world system implementation. Success requires targeted, efficient preparation.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Baidu interview questions reveals a clear, challenging trend: **0% Easy, 55% Medium, and 45% Hard problems**. This distribution is telling. Baidu does not waste time on trivial checks. The interview is a direct assessment of your ability to handle complex, non-obvious problems under pressure. The high percentage of Hard questions indicates they are probing for depth—candidates must not only implement standard algorithms but also optimize them and handle intricate edge cases. The Medium questions serve as a baseline; failing to solve these quickly and correctly is often an immediate disqualification. Your preparation must be calibrated for this high-difficulty environment from day one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of core topics. Master these, as they form the backbone of Baidu’s technical screening.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** The most frequent topic. You must be proficient in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, especially for string and array manipulation. Key patterns include knapsack, LCS, and partition problems.
- **Array:** Fundamental to almost all problems. Expect questions involving traversal, sorting, searching, and complex in-place manipulations. Master two-pointer and sliding window techniques.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize brute-force solutions. Crucial for problems involving frequency counting, deduplication, or mapping relationships.
- **String:** Often intertwined with DP and array techniques. Focus on palindrome checks, subsequence problems, anagram matching, and string transformations.
- **Divide and Conquer:** Appears in high-difficulty problems, such as optimized binary search variations, merge sort modifications, or complex tree operations.

Given DP's prominence, the most important pattern to master is the **"Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)"** framework. It's a classic DP problem that teaches state definition and transition, which applies to many other string and array problems.

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    # dp[i][j] = LCS length for text1[:i], text2[:j]
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[m][n]
```

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
  const m = text1.length,
    n = text2.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[m][n];
}
```

```java
public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
    int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();
    int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

With the high difficulty bar, a structured, intensive plan is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Topic Mastery**

- Days 1-3: Revisit core data structures (Arrays, Hash Maps, Trees, Graphs). Implement them from scratch.
- For the next 10 days, dedicate each day to one of the top topics. For DP, spend at least 3 days. For each topic:
  1.  Study the fundamental patterns (e.g., for DP: top-down memoization vs. bottom-up tabulation).
  2.  Solve 5-8 curated Medium problems.
  3.  Solve 2-4 Hard problems. Focus on understanding the solution derivation, not just memorization.

**Weeks 3-4: Problem Integration & Pattern Recognition**

- Stop solving by topic. Start doing mixed problem sets that mimic an actual interview.
- Practice on platforms with timer settings. For every problem, enforce the 30-35 minute rule: 5-10 minutes to understand and plan, 15-20 minutes to code, 5 minutes to test and debug.
- Begin each session with 1-2 Medium problems as a warm-up, then tackle 1-2 Hard problems.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Weakness Attack**

- Schedule at least 2-3 mock interviews per week with peers or using professional services. Simulate the exact format (video call, shared editor, no IDE).
- Analyze every mistake from the previous weeks. Create a "mistake journal" categorizing errors: misreading the problem, missing edge cases, suboptimal complexity, or buggy implementation. Systematically eliminate these weaknesses.
- In the final days, review your journal and re-solve your most-missed problems.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your DP State First.** When a DP problem appears, immediately articulate your `dp` array definition aloud. "I will define `dp[i][j]` as the optimal value for the subproblem up to index `i` in string A and index `j` in string B." This demonstrates structured thinking before you write a single line of code.
2.  **Optimize Space After Correctness.** For DP and array problems, first write the correct solution with clear, readable logic—even if it uses O(n²) space. Once it's correct and explained, then propose and implement the space-optimized version (e.g., rolling array). This shows prioritization of correct, maintainable code over premature optimization.
3.  **Practice Chinese-Language Problem Statements.** Many Baidu assessments and interviewers will use Chinese. Familiarize yourself with common technical terminology in Chinese (算法, 时间复杂度, 动态规划, 数组) to avoid misinterpreting a problem under stress.
4.  **Test with Complex Edge Cases.** Before declaring a problem solved, verbally run through edge cases: empty input, single element, large duplicates, sorted/reverse-sorted arrays, and extreme values. Then, write a few test lines in the editor to prove it. This attention to robustness is expected.

Cracking Baidu's interview is about demonstrating deep, flexible mastery of algorithmic fundamentals under high-stakes conditions. Target the hard problems, internalize the core patterns, and practice with relentless focus on quality and communication.
