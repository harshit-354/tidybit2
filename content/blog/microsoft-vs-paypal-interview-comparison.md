When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. Microsoft and PayPal, while both major players, present distinct interview landscapes. Microsoft's process is a high-volume, broad-spectrum test of core computer science fundamentals, whereas PayPal's is a more concentrated assessment of practical data manipulation and problem-solving skills. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question banks. Microsoft's list, with **1,352 questions**, dwarfs PayPal's **106 questions**. This volume reflects Microsoft's vast array of product teams and its long-standing, highly standardized interview process. The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Microsoft (E379/M762/H211):** The majority of questions are Medium difficulty (762), indicating a strong emphasis on applying core concepts to non-trivial problems. The significant number of Easy questions (379) often serves as warm-ups or tests for fundamental coding correctness, while the Hard questions (211) are typically reserved for senior or specialized roles.
- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The distribution is heavily skewed toward Medium difficulty (69 out of 106), with a smaller proportion of Easy and Hard questions. This suggests PayPal's interviews are consistently challenging but perhaps less focused on extreme algorithmic optimization than on robust, clean solutions to common technical problems.

This disparity means preparation for Microsoft requires a longer, more endurance-based study plan to cover potential question breadth, while PayPal prep can be more focused and deep.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily prioritize **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These form the bedrock of practical coding interviews, testing a candidate's ability to manipulate data efficiently.

**Microsoft** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a core topic. This signals an expectation for strong foundational knowledge in optimization and recursive problem-solving, which is common for companies with deep roots in algorithms and systems software. You must be prepared to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

**PayPal** lists **Sorting** as a core topic alongside the big three. This highlights a focus on data organization, searching, and often, the application of these techniques to solve business-logic adjacent problems (e.g., transaction logs, user data). While sorting is a component of many solutions, its explicit mention suggests it may be a primary focus in some PayPal questions.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, focusing on Hash Tables:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

A problem more specific to Microsoft's listed topics might involve Dynamic Programming:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Microsoft first**. Its broader and deeper question pool covers a wider range of fundamental computer science topics, particularly Dynamic Programming. Mastering the Microsoft-style questions will inherently cover nearly all the technical ground needed for PayPal's interviews (Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Sorting). The reverse is not true; focusing solely on PayPal's scope would leave significant gaps for a Microsoft interview.

A solid strategy is to build a foundation using the Microsoft question list, ensuring comfort with Medium-difficulty problems across all its core topics. Then, closer to a PayPal interview, refine your skills by practicing PayPal-specific questions, paying extra attention to sorting algorithms and their applications. This approach maximizes efficiency and builds the strongest overall problem-solving skills.
