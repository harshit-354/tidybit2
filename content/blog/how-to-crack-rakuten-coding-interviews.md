Rakuten’s coding interviews are a direct test of practical problem-solving. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on algorithmic questions, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live coding environment. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication. Understanding the specific patterns Rakuten favors is the fastest way to prepare.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Rakuten coding questions reveals a clear profile: **89% Medium difficulty, 11% Easy, and 0% Hard**. This distribution is critical for your strategy.

It means Rakuten is not trying to eliminate candidates with obscure, complex algorithms. Instead, they are assessing a solid, reliable foundation. Can you consistently solve standard problems under pressure? Can you handle the common variations and edge cases? The absence of Hard questions suggests that deep, specialized knowledge in advanced data structures (like segment trees or flow algorithms) is less important than mastery of core topics. Your goal is to become extremely proficient at Medium-level problems, aiming for a near-perfect solve rate.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **Array:** The most fundamental data structure. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place manipulation, and subarray calculations.
- **String:** Often intertwined with Array problems. Focus on character counting, palindrome checks, and sliding window techniques for substrings.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions. It's frequently the key to turning an O(n²) brute-force approach into an O(n) one.
- **Math:** Problems involving number properties, basic arithmetic, or simulation. These test logical reasoning and careful handling of constraints (like overflow).
- **Matrix:** A 2D extension of array problems. The core patterns are traversal (spiral, diagonal) and performing calculations based on neighboring cells.

The most critical pattern across these topics is using a **Hash Table to complement an Array or String traversal**, often to find pairs or subarrays satisfying a condition. The classic "Two Sum" problem is the archetype.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // No solution found
}
```

</div>

This pattern extends directly to problems like finding a subarray with a given sum or checking for anagrams. Master this first.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-based plan is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Math, Matrix). For each, solve 8-10 curated Medium problems. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern, not just the specific solution. Implement each solution in your primary interview language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Move to mixed-topic problem sets. This is where you practice identifying which pattern to apply. Is this a sliding window (String/Array) or a prefix sum with a hash map (Array)? Start timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Rakuten-Specific Prep.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Seek out problems tagged with Rakuten or from similar companies. In the final days, review your notes on the core patterns and write clean, boilerplate code for common operations (e.g., matrix traversal, character frequency counting).

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Before you write code, state your brute-force idea, then explain the optimization. Rakuten interviewers want to see your thought process, not just a silent coding sprint.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First.** Given the Medium-heavy focus, a complete, correct, and well-explained O(n²) solution is often better than an incomplete or buggy O(n) attempt. You can always optimize later if time permits.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Explicitly run through examples like empty input, single-element arrays, large values, and negative numbers. Mentioning these shows systematic thinking.
4.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use clear variable names, consistent indentation, and include a brief comment for complex logic. Treat the editor as if you were writing real code for their team.

Success in Rakuten's interviews comes from consistent, pattern-focused practice on Medium-difficulty problems in their favorite domains. Build that muscle memory.
