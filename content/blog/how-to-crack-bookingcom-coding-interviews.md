Booking.com’s coding interviews are a critical filter for software engineering roles, known for a strong emphasis on practical problem-solving and data manipulation. The process typically involves one or two technical phone screens focusing on algorithms and data structures, followed by a virtual onsite with multiple rounds that may include system design and behavioral components. The coding problems are designed to assess your ability to handle real-world data processing scenarios efficiently.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 14 recent Booking.com coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 2 Easy (14%), 8 Medium (57%), and 4 Hard (29%). This breakdown is telling. The majority of your interview will be fought in the "Medium" difficulty tier. These problems require more than just knowing syntax; they demand a solid grasp of core algorithms and the ability to combine concepts under time pressure. The significant presence of "Hard" problems (nearly 1 in 3) indicates that for senior or more competitive roles, you must be prepared for complex scenarios involving optimization, advanced data structures, or tricky edge cases. You cannot afford to be weak on fundamentals. The low count of "Easy" questions suggests they are used more as warm-ups or for very junior positions—expect the bar to be set at Medium as a baseline.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **Array:** The foundation. Expect problems involving traversal, in-place manipulation, and subarray calculations.
- **Hash Table:** The most frequent companion to arrays. Used for instant O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). Mastering two-sum style problems is non-negotiable.
- **String:** Closely related to array problems. Focus on anagrams, palindromes, and string transformation using arrays or hash tables for counting.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Critical for problems involving ordering, scheduling, or finding top/bottom K elements. It’s often the key to optimizing a naive sorting approach.
- **Sorting:** Rarely the final answer but a crucial preprocessing step. Many problems become tractable once data is ordered.

The most important pattern to master is combining a **Hash Table with an Array or String** to achieve efficient lookups. This pattern is at the heart of countless Booking.com problems involving data deduplication, frequency counting, or validating conditions.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: Find two hotel IDs that sum to a target reward points value.
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Find two flight durations that sum to a target layover.
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Example: Find two property ratings that sum to a target score.
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is essential. Here is a focused plan.

- **Week 1-2: Core Foundations.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics: Array, Hash Table, String, Heap, and Sorting. For each topic, solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Understand every variant. Implement heaps from scratch in your primary language.
- **Week 3-4: Pattern Integration and Practice.** Move to problems that combine these topics. Focus on patterns like Two Pointers with sorted arrays, Sliding Window with hash maps, and Heap for top-K problems. Start timing your sessions (45 minutes per problem).
- **Week 5: Mock Interviews and Company-Specific Problems.** Simulate the actual interview environment. Use platforms to do live mocks with peers. Solve every Booking.com tagged problem you can find. The patterns will repeat.
- **Week 6: Refinement and Review.** Revisit your mistakes. Drill weak areas. Ensure you can clearly explain your thought process for every problem you've solved. Polish your code for readability and edge case handling.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Medium First.** Your highest ROI is mastering Medium-difficulty problems across the top topics. Ensure you can solve these flawlessly and articulately before diving deep into Hard problems.
2.  **Talk Through the Brute Force First.** Never jump straight to the optimal solution. Start by stating a simple, brute-force approach, analyze its complexity (O(n²) time, O(1) space), then iterate towards optimization. This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Think Aloud, Constantly.** Interviewers evaluate your problem-solving process. Verbalize your thoughts: "I need to find pairs, so a hash table could store seen elements. The trade-off is O(n) space for O(n) time."
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring completion, run your logic through edge cases: empty input, single element, large values, duplicates. State these out loud and adjust your code if needed.
5.  **Practice with Real Data Scenarios.** When solving problems, mentally frame them in Booking.com's domain: arrays of hotel prices, strings of guest names, heaps for sorting search results. This helps you anticipate the types of manipulations required.

Success in Booking.com interviews hinges on methodical preparation focused on high-probability topics and patterns. Structure your study, practice communication, and drill until efficient problem-solving becomes automatic.
