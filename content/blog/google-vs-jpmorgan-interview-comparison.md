When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the distinct profiles of top tech companies versus major financial institutions is crucial. Google, representing the pinnacle of the tech industry, and JPMorgan Chase, a leader in finance and technology, have vastly different approaches to assessing software engineering talent. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is sheer scale. Google's question bank is massive, with **2,217** documented questions, dwarfing JPMorgan's **78**. This reflects Google's longer history of intense, algorithm-focused interviews and its position as a primary target for engineers worldwide.

The difficulty distribution also reveals contrasting priorities. Google's breakdown is **588 Easy (26.5%), 1153 Medium (52.0%), 476 Hard (21.5%)**. This shows a strong emphasis on Medium and Hard problems, testing deep algorithmic reasoning and optimization under pressure. In contrast, JPMorgan's distribution is **25 Easy (32%), 45 Medium (58%), 8 Hard (10%)**. The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions, with a minimal number of truly Hard problems. This suggests JPMorgan's technical screen is more about assessing solid foundational competency and problem-solving approach rather than pushing candidates to the limits of algorithmic complexity.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** are top topics for both, forming a critical common ground. These are fundamental to most software development and are essential to master.

The key divergence lies in advanced topics. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a major topic for Google (#4) but is absent from JPMorgan's top list. Google frequently uses DP problems to evaluate a candidate's ability to handle optimization and state transition, a hallmark of their interview difficulty. Conversely, **Sorting** appears as a distinct top topic for JPMorgan. While sorting algorithms are foundational, their explicit prominence at JPMorgan may indicate a focus on practical data manipulation and a slightly different problem style.

```python
# Example of a common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example of a Google-favored DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example of a common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example of a Google-favored DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Example of a Google-favored DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order depends entirely on your target. If your goal is **Google**, you must prepare for it first and with singular focus. The volume and difficulty demand months of dedicated practice, especially on Medium/Hard Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and Trees. Mastering Google's bar will make you over-prepared for JPMorgan's technical screen.

If your primary target is **JPMorgan or similar finance tech roles**, you can follow a more streamlined path. Focus intensely on mastering **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting** problems at the Easy and Medium level. Ensure you can clearly communicate your reasoning. Once this foundation is solid, you can selectively practice a few Hard problems and explore Dynamic Programming if you have extra time or are also considering tech companies.

In essence, Google preparation is a marathon that covers JPMorgan's sprint. The reverse is not true. Prioritize based on your highest-priority, highest-difficulty target.
