When preparing for technical interviews at specific companies, understanding their question patterns is crucial for efficient study. Both Wix and Twitter ask a similar number of questions in their tagged LeetCode datasets, but the distribution of difficulty and the emphasis on certain problem types differ significantly. This comparison breaks down their profiles to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of tagged questions is nearly identical: **56 for Wix** and **53 for Twitter**. The major difference lies in the difficulty spread.

**Wix (E16/M31/H9)** shows a strong focus on **Medium** problems, which make up over 55% of their questions. Their Easy count is substantial, and Hard problems are relatively few. This suggests Wix interviews are likely structured to assess solid foundational and applied problem-solving skills, with fewer extreme optimization challenges.

**Twitter (E8/M33/H12)** has a very similar Medium count but a starkly different distribution on the ends. It has **far fewer Easy** questions and **significantly more Hard** problems. This indicates Twitter's process may involve a higher bar for initial problem-solving or may include more complex, multi-part questions that push into advanced optimization and system design thinking.

In short: Wix's distribution is more balanced and accessible, while Twitter's skews toward more challenging problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures. The top four topics for each are nearly identical:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Hash Table**
- **Depth-First Search (Wix)** / **Design (Twitter)**

This overlap means preparing for one company will build strong fundamentals for the other. The key divergence is the fourth topic.

**Wix's inclusion of Depth-First Search** highlights a clear emphasis on **tree and graph traversal algorithms**. You can expect problems involving pathfinding, subtree analysis, or recursive backtracking.

```python
# Example DFS structure (Tree)
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Process node
    dfs(node.left)
    dfs(node.right)
```

```javascript
// Example DFS structure (Tree)
function dfs(node) {
  if (!node) return;
  // Process node
  dfs(node.left);
  dfs(node.right);
}
```

```java
// Example DFS structure (Tree)
public void dfs(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    // Process node
    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
}
```

</div>

**Twitter's inclusion of Design** signals that **object-oriented design (OOD)** or **low-level system design** questions are a staple. This could range from designing a parking lot or a deck of cards to initial concepts for a scalable service.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Sketch of a simple OOD answer
class TwitterUser:
    def __init__(self, userId):
        self.userId = userId
        self.following = set()

    def follow(self, followeeId):
        self.following.add(followeeId)
```

```javascript
// Sketch of a simple OOD answer
class TwitterUser {
  constructor(userId) {
    this.userId = userId;
    this.following = new Set();
  }
  follow(followeeId) {
    this.following.add(followeeId);
  }
}
```

```java
// Sketch of a simple OOD answer
public class TwitterUser {
    private int userId;
    private Set<Integer> following;

    public TwitterUser(int userId) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.following = new HashSet<>();
    }
    public void follow(int followeeId) {
        following.add(followeeId);
    }
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Wix**. Its higher volume of Easy and Medium problems provides a gentler on-ramp to master the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) that are essential for both companies. Solving Wix's DFS problems will solidify your recursive and graph traversal skills, which are transferable to many Hard problems.

Once comfortable, transition to **Twitter** preparation. This shift requires two key adjustments:

1.  **Upping the difficulty:** Practice more Hard problems focusing on optimization and edge cases.
2.  **Adding a new skill set:** Study object-oriented design principles and practice translating vague requirements into clean class diagrams and interactions.

Effectively, preparing for Wix builds your algorithmic core, while preparing for Twitter adds a layer of advanced problem-solving and design on top of that core. If interviewing for both, this sequential approach is efficient. If you have only one target, focus intensely on its specific profile: algorithmic depth and trees for Wix, versus high difficulty and design for Twitter.
