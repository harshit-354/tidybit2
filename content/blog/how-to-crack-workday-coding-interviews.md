Workday’s technical interviews for software engineering roles are known for a strong emphasis on practical problem-solving and clean code. While the process may include system design and behavioral rounds, the coding screen and on-site technical sessions are typically leetcode-style. The focus is less on obscure algorithms and more on applying fundamental techniques to real-world adjacent problems. Understanding the specific patterns they favor is the fastest path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Workday coding questions reveals a clear profile: out of a sample of six problems, **five were of Medium difficulty (83%) and one was Hard (17%)**. Notably, there were zero Easy problems.

This distribution is telling. Workday isn't screening for basic syntax; they are testing for solid competency. The high concentration of Medium problems indicates they want candidates who can reliably decompose a non-trivial problem, select an appropriate algorithm, implement it correctly under time pressure, and discuss trade-offs. The occasional Hard problem serves as a differentiator for senior roles or particularly competitive positions. Your preparation should be squarely aimed at mastering Medium-level questions across their favorite domains.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a focused set of core topics. Prioritize these in your study.

- **Array & String Manipulation:** The absolute bedrock. Expect problems involving in-place transformations, partitioning, and subarray/substring analysis.
- **Sorting:** Rarely just "sort a list." More often, sorting is the key preprocessing step that enables an efficient solution (like the two-pointer technique) for a larger problem.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** A favorite for Medium problems. The challenge is recognizing when a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution and proving it (at least conceptually).
- **Two Pointers:** This is the most critical _technique_ to master for Workday. It's the workhorse for solving a huge swath of Array, String, and Sorting-related problems efficiently, often turning an O(n²) solution into O(n).

The two-pointer technique is non-negotiable. A classic pattern is using a left and right pointer to converge towards the center of a sorted array. Here’s the quintessential example: finding two numbers in a sorted array that sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed as per common problem
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1  # Need a larger sum
        else:
            right -= 1  # Need a smaller sum
    return [-1, -1]  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

</div>

This pattern extends to problems like removing duplicates, container with most water, and 3Sum. Master its variations.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill the top topics: Array, String, Sorting, Greedy, and Two Pointers. Solve 15-20 Medium problems for each topic. Don't just solve—for each problem, articulate _why_ you chose your approach and its time/space complexity. Use a platform that categorizes problems by company and topic.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration & Workday-Specific Practice.** Start solving mixed-topic problem sets to simulate the actual interview. Dedicate significant time to **Workday-tagged problems**. The patterns will repeat. Begin practicing aloud: explain your thought process as you code, as you will be expected to do this during the interview.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gaps.** Conduct at least 4-6 mock interviews with a peer or mentor using Workday-style Medium problems. Time yourself strictly (30-40 minutes per problem). Identify any remaining weak spots in the core topics and review the underlying theory. In the final days, revisit and re-solve the most common Workday problems you've seen.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** From the moment you read the problem, talk. Clarify edge cases, state your initial brute-force idea, then explain the optimized approach. Your interviewer is evaluating your problem-solving _process_ as much as the final code.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First, Then Optimization.** A buggy, "optimal" solution is worse than a correct, slightly slower one. Get a working solution (even if it's brute-force) on the virtual whiteboard first. Then, and only then, discuss how to optimize it. This demonstrates structured thinking.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names, include consistent indentation, and write helper functions when logic becomes complex. Comment briefly on tricky sections. Workday values clean, maintainable code.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution done, walk through a few test cases: empty input, single element, large values, and the examples provided. This is the easiest way to catch off-by-one errors and show thoroughness.

Success in a Workday coding interview comes from targeted, deliberate practice on their preferred problem set. Master the core topics, internalize the two-pointer and greedy patterns, and practice articulating your logic.
