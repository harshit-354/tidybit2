GitHub’s technical interview process is designed to assess not just raw coding ability, but also problem-solving clarity, communication, and collaboration—values central to the platform itself. While the specific format can vary by team, you can generally expect a series of live coding sessions focused on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted in a shared editor. The problems are practical, testing your ability to write clean, efficient, and correct code under time constraints. Success hinges on a targeted preparation strategy that aligns with GitHub’s known focus areas.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of GitHub’s recent coding interviews reveals a clear pattern in difficulty distribution: approximately 50% Easy, 25% Medium, and 25% Hard questions. This breakdown is strategic.

The high proportion of **Easy** questions serves as a critical filter. These aren’t free passes; they test fundamental competency, attention to detail, and the ability to write bug-free code quickly. Fumbling an Easy question is often an immediate red flag. The **Medium** question is the core of the evaluation, designed to see how you handle a non-trivial problem requiring a known algorithm or pattern. The **Hard** question is a differentiator. It’s less about solving it perfectly and more about demonstrating structured problem-solving under pressure—how you break it down, communicate your approach, and make meaningful progress.

This mix means your preparation must be balanced. You cannot afford to neglect fundamentals while chasing complex algorithms. Consistency across all difficulty levels is key.

## Top Topics to Focus On

Data shows a strong emphasis on a few core areas. Mastering these will cover a significant portion of what you’ll encounter.

- **Array & Hash Table:** The cornerstone of practical problem-solving. Expect to use arrays for in-place manipulations and hash tables (dictionaries, maps) for O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often turning O(n²) brute force into O(n).
- **Math & Bit Manipulation:** GitHub frequently includes problems requiring number theory or clever use of bitwise operations. These test your low-level understanding and ability to write highly efficient, often constant-space, solutions.
- **Sorting:** While you may not implement a sort from scratch, understanding the properties of sorted data (enabling binary search, two-pointer techniques) is essential. Many array problems are solved by “sort first, then apply logic.”

The most critical pattern to master is the **Hash Table for frequency or complement tracking**, frequently used in Array problems. The classic example is the Two Sum problem.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {}; // No solution
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured, topic-focused approach is more effective than random practice.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this phase to **Easy** and **Medium** problems exclusively. Cycle through the core topics: Array, Hash Table, Math, Bit Manipulation. Solve 2-3 problems per topic daily. The goal is to internalize patterns like the hash map complement check, two-pointers on sorted arrays, and basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts).

**Weeks 3-4: Depth & Integration.** Shift focus to **Medium** problems that combine topics (e.g., an Array problem solved with Hash Table and Sorting). Begin timed practice sessions (45-60 minutes). Start attempting one **Hard** problem every other day, focusing on deconstructing the problem and writing a clear brute-force solution first before optimizing.

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Review.** Conduct full mock interviews under realistic conditions. Use a platform with a shared editor and have a friend act as interviewer, or record yourself explaining your thought process aloud. Revisit all problems you struggled with. In the final days, prioritize rest and mental preparation over cramming.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Treat the interview as a collaborative debugging session. Think out loud from the moment you see the problem. Explain your brute-force idea, its complexity, and then how you plan to optimize. Silence is your biggest enemy.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness First.** For any problem, especially the Easy ones, your first goal is to produce a working, syntactically correct solution. Write clean code with sensible variable names. _Then_ discuss and implement optimizations. A fast but buggy solution is worse than a slightly slower, correct one.
3.  **Validate with Examples.** Before you start coding, walk through 2-3 custom test cases, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). This catches misunderstandings early and demonstrates thoroughness.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Never assume. Ask about input constraints (size, value ranges), expected output format, and whether you can modify the input. This shows you’re thinking about the problem’s scope and practical details.

Mastering these patterns and strategies will build the muscle memory and confidence needed to perform under the unique pressure of a GitHub interview. The process tests your ability to be a reliable, communicative engineer—exactly the kind of contributor they value on their platform.
