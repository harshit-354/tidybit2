When preparing for technical interviews at major IT services companies, TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and Zoho represent two distinct profiles. TCS is a global IT services, consulting, and business solutions giant, while Zoho is a privately-held, product-based company known for its suite of business software. This difference in corporate focus—services versus product—influences their technical interview processes, even as they share common ground in fundamental computer science concepts. Understanding the nuances in their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics is crucial for efficient preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows TCS has a larger overall question bank (217 questions) compared to Zoho (179 questions). The difficulty breakdown is revealing.

**TCS (217 questions):** Easy (94), Medium (103), Hard (20). The distribution is balanced between Easy and Medium, with a significant emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems. This suggests TCS interviews often test a solid, practical grasp of core algorithms and data structures, with a smaller portion dedicated to challenging optimization problems.

**Zoho (179 questions):** Easy (62), Medium (97), Hard (20). While also Medium-heavy, Zoho has a slightly higher proportion of Medium questions relative to its total. The identical number of Hard questions (20) indicates both companies include complex problems, likely for more advanced roles or later interview rounds.

The takeaway: For both companies, mastering Medium-difficulty problems is the key. The larger volume for TCS implies a broader but similarly-tiered question pool.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily prioritize **Array** and **String** manipulation, the bedrock of coding interviews. **Hash Table** is also a shared critical topic, essential for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

The primary divergence is in the fourth major topic. TCS emphasizes **Two Pointers**, a technique optimal for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists (e.g., finding pairs, removing duplicates, or palindrome checks).

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
    if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
      i++;
      nums[i] = nums[j];
    }
  }
  return i + 1;
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers: Removing duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}
```

</div>

Conversely, Zoho highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems. This aligns with Zoho's product-development focus, where algorithmic optimization for scalable software is highly valued (e.g., in problems like the Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, or maximum subarray sum).

<div class="code-group">

```python
# DP: Classic Fibonacci (Memoization)
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

```javascript
// DP: Classic Fibonacci (Memoization)
function fib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

```java
// DP: Classic Fibonacci (Memoization)
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int fib(int n, HashMap<Integer, Integer> memo) {
        if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
        if (n <= 2) return 1;
        int result = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
        memo.put(n, result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the shared foundation. **Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables** are non-negotiable for both. Drill into problems involving traversal, sorting, searching, and hashing.

If your primary target is **TCS**, prioritize mastering the **Two Pointers** technique after the core topics. Practice problems on sorted data sets and linked lists. The balanced Easy/Medium spread means you should be able to solve most common array/string problems efficiently.

If your primary target is **Zoho**, invest significant time in **Dynamic Programming**. Begin with classic problems (Fibonacci, climbing stairs) before moving to more advanced 1D and 2D DP challenges. Since Zoho's distribution skews slightly more toward Medium, ensure your solutions are not only correct but also optimized for time and space complexity.

For candidates interviewing at both, the overlap is substantial. Build a strong base in the three common topics, then branch out to cover Two Pointers and Dynamic Programming. This strategy will make you competitive for the coding rounds at either company.
