When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns is crucial for efficient study. NVIDIA and Airbnb represent two distinct ends of the spectrum in terms of interview focus, volume, and difficulty distribution. NVIDIA, a hardware and AI giant, emphasizes core data structure proficiency at scale, while Airbnb, a consumer-facing marketplace, blends these fundamentals with more complex algorithmic problem-solving. A strategic comparison helps candidates allocate their preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data reveals a significant difference in the breadth of questions you might encounter.

**NVIDIA** presents a much larger pool with **137 questions**, categorized as 34 Easy, 89 Medium, and 14 Hard. This high volume, dominated by Medium-difficulty problems, suggests NVIDIA's interviews are designed to test broad, solid competency across fundamental topics. The process likely involves solving several problems where correctness, clean implementation, and handling edge cases on standard concepts are key. The relatively lower proportion of Hard questions indicates that while depth is tested, extreme algorithmic complexity might be less frequent than at pure software companies.

**Airbnb** has a more concentrated set of **64 questions**, with a distribution of 11 Easy, 34 Medium, and 19 Hard. Notably, the proportion of Hard questions is significantly higher (~30% vs. NVIDIA's ~10%). This points to an interview process that, after establishing basics, delves deeper into challenging scenarios. You can expect to encounter more problems requiring non-trivial insights, advanced pattern application, or multi-step optimization.

```python
# Example of a common "Medium" depth problem (relevant to both)
# Find all anagrams in a string (LeetCode 438)
def findAnagrams(s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
    if len(p) > len(s):
        return []
    p_count, s_count = {}, {}
    for i in range(len(p)):
        p_count[p[i]] = 1 + p_count.get(p[i], 0)
        s_count[s[i]] = 1 + s_count.get(s[i], 0)
    res = [0] if p_count == s_count else []
    l = 0
    for r in range(len(p), len(s)):
        s_count[s[r]] = 1 + s_count.get(s[r], 0)
        s_count[s[l]] -= 1
        if s_count[s[l]] == 0:
            del s_count[s[l]]
        l += 1
        if s_count == p_count:
            res.append(l)
    return res
```

```javascript
// Find all anagrams in a string
function findAnagrams(s, p) {
  if (p.length > s.length) return [];
  const pCount = {},
    sCount = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
    pCount[p[i]] = (pCount[p[i]] || 0) + 1;
    sCount[s[i]] = (sCount[s[i]] || 0) + 1;
  }
  const res = compareMaps(pCount, sCount) ? [0] : [];
  let l = 0;
  for (let r = p.length; r < s.length; r++) {
    sCount[s[r]] = (sCount[s[r]] || 0) + 1;
    sCount[s[l]]--;
    if (sCount[s[l]] === 0) delete sCount[s[l]];
    l++;
    if (compareMaps(pCount, sCount)) res.push(l);
  }
  return res;
}
function compareMaps(map1, map2) {
  if (Object.keys(map1).length !== Object.keys(map2).length) return false;
  for (let key in map1) {
    if (map1[key] !== map2[key]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Find all anagrams in a string
public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (p.length() > s.length()) return result;
    Map<Character, Integer> pCount = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> sCount = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < p.length(); i++) {
        pCount.put(p.charAt(i), pCount.getOrDefault(p.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        sCount.put(s.charAt(i), sCount.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
    }
    if (pCount.equals(sCount)) result.add(0);
    int left = 0;
    for (int right = p.length(); right < s.length(); right++) {
        char rChar = s.charAt(right);
        sCount.put(rChar, sCount.getOrDefault(rChar, 0) + 1);
        char lChar = s.charAt(left);
        sCount.put(lChar, sCount.get(lChar) - 1);
        if (sCount.get(lChar) == 0) sCount.remove(lChar);
        left++;
        if (pCount.equals(sCount)) result.add(left);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These form the essential toolkit for most coding interviews. Mastering sliding window, two-pointer techniques on arrays/strings, and efficient lookups with hash maps is mandatory for either company.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. NVIDIA emphasizes **Sorting**, which aligns with a focus on foundational data manipulation and algorithm efficiency. Problems often involve sorting as a preprocessing step or implementing custom comparators.

Airbnb highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This signals a stronger emphasis on optimizing recursive problems, breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems, and system design considerations that may involve optimal decision-making—skills highly relevant for building scalable marketplace features.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example highlighting a potential DP focus (Airbnb)
# House Robber (LeetCode 198) - A classic DP problem
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, len(nums) + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])
    return dp[-1]
```

```javascript
// House Robber - Dynamic Programming
function rob(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  const dp = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = nums[0];
  for (let i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1]);
  }
  return dp[nums.length];
}
```

```java
// House Robber - Dynamic Programming
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length + 1];
    dp[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 2; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[nums.length];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **NVIDIA's profile**. Its vast number of Medium problems on core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) provides the perfect training ground to build speed, accuracy, and fluency with the fundamentals that are _also essential for Airbnb_. Achieving comfort here ensures you can reliably solve the baseline problems in any interview.

Once fundamentals are automatic, pivot to **Airbnb's profile**. This involves intensifying practice on Hard problems and deepening your understanding of **Dynamic Programming** and other advanced patterns. The smaller question set is more concentrated but requires higher problem-solving maturity.

Effectively, preparing for NVIDIA builds the robust foundation, and preparing for Airbnb adds the advanced layer on top of it. A candidate solid on Airbnb-style questions will likely find NVIDIA's emphasis on fundamentals manageable, while the reverse might not be true due to the gap in required depth for complex algorithms.

For targeted practice, visit the NVIDIA question list at [TidyBit /company/nvidia](/company/nvidia) and the Airbnb list at [TidyBit /company/airbnb](/company/airbnb).
