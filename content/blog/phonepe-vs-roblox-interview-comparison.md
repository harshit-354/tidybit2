When preparing for technical interviews at different companies, understanding their specific question patterns, difficulty distribution, and favored topics is crucial for efficient study. PhonePe and Roblox, while both assessing core software engineering skills, present distinct interview landscapes. PhonePe's process is characterized by a higher volume of questions with a significant emphasis on advanced problem-solving, whereas Roblox focuses on a more curated set with a stronger tilt towards fundamental data structures and applied mathematics. This comparison breaks down their question banks to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. PhonePe's tagged question bank is substantially larger at **102 questions** compared to Roblox's **56 questions**. This suggests PhonePe's interview process may draw from a broader pool of problems or that its historical data is more extensively documented.

The difficulty distribution reveals their technical bar. PhonePe's breakdown is 102 questions (E3/M63/H36). The majority (63%) are **Medium** difficulty, but there is a substantial portion of **Hard** problems (35%). This indicates PhonePe interviews rigorously test complex algorithm optimization and sophisticated dynamic programming.

In contrast, Roblox's distribution is 56 questions (E8/M36/H12). Here, **Medium** problems also dominate (64%), but the share of **Hard** questions is much lower at roughly 21%, with a correspondingly higher number of **Easy** questions (14%). This points to an interview that deeply tests core competency and clean implementation under pressure, rather than solely on solving the most complex algorithmic puzzles.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **Hash Table** manipulation, making these absolute must-know areas.

**PhonePe's** key topics are Array, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, and Hash Table. The explicit prominence of **Dynamic Programming** and **Sorting** signals a deep, algorithmic focus. You can expect problems involving optimal substructure, memoization/tabulation, and efficient sorting-based solutions.

**Roblox's** key topics are Array, Hash Table, String, and Math. The inclusion of **String** and **Math** highlights an application-oriented focus. Interviews likely involve text processing, encoding, game-related calculations, geometry, or probability—skills directly relevant to building a gaming platform.

Here is a typical problem that might appear at either company, solved using a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should align with your interview timeline and the company's focus.

**Prepare for PhonePe first if:** Your interview is sooner, or you need to ramp up on advanced algorithms. The large volume and high density of Medium/Hard problems, especially in Dynamic Programming, require significant dedicated practice. Mastering PhonePe's question bank will inherently cover the core Array and Hash Table skills needed for Roblox, while also pushing your algorithmic limits.

**Prepare for Roblox first if:** Your interview is sooner, or you want to solidify fundamentals before tackling more complex problems. Excelling at Roblox requires impeccable mastery of Array, Hash Table, and String manipulation—foundational skills that are also essential for PhonePe. This approach builds a strong base. You can then layer on the additional Depth-First Search and Dynamic Programming knowledge required for PhonePe's harder problems.

In essence, Roblox preparation builds a robust foundation, while PhonePe preparation demands advanced specialization. A strong candidate for either will have Arrays and Hash Tables down cold.
