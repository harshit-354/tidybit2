Palantir Technologies’s coding interviews are known for their focus on practical problem-solving with data. The process typically involves 2-3 technical rounds, often featuring questions that blend algorithmic reasoning with data structure manipulation to solve problems that feel adjacent to real-world data analysis and system design. Success requires a strong foundation in core patterns and the ability to write clean, efficient code under pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of 30 questions, the difficulty distribution is: **5 Easy (17%), 20 Medium (67%), and 5 Hard (17%)**. This breakdown is telling. The overwhelming majority of problems are at the Medium level, which means Palantir is primarily testing for strong, all-around competency. You must be able to reliably solve Medium problems within 30-35 minutes, including time to explain your approach. The Hard problems are the differentiator; they often involve combining multiple patterns or optimizing a solution beyond the first intuitive approach. Don't neglect Easy problems—they are excellent for practicing bug-free, optimal code as a warm-up. The key takeaway: master Medium problems to pass the bar, and practice Hard problems to secure a top evaluation.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are **Array, String, Sorting, Hash Table, and Two Pointers**. These are not isolated; they frequently combine. For example, a sorting step can enable an efficient two-pointer solution on an array.

- **Array & String:** The fundamental data structures. Palantir questions often involve manipulating, traversing, or transforming array and string data. Think in terms of in-place operations, subarray/substring problems, and matrix traversal.
- **Sorting:** Rarely the final answer, but a critical preprocessing step. Mastering efficient sorts (and knowing when to use them) is key to unlocking optimal solutions for pairing, searching, or comparison-based problems.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to track frequencies, indices, or seen elements. It’s indispensable for problems involving duplicates, complements (like Two Sum), or caching intermediate results.
- **Two Pointers:** A supremely efficient pattern for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings, often to find pairs, remove duplicates, or check for palindromes. It’s a classic technique to reduce O(n²) brute-force ideas to O(n).

The **Two Pointers** pattern is particularly crucial for Palantir-style data manipulation. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # `write` pointer tracks the position of the last unique element.
    write = 0
    # `read` pointer scans through the array.
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[write]:
            write += 1
            nums[write] = nums[read]
    # Length of the unique segment is `write + 1`.
    return write + 1
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 0;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[write]) {
      write++;
      nums[write] = nums[read];
    }
  }
  return write + 1;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 0;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[write]) {
            write++;
            nums[write] = nums[read];
        }
    }
    return write + 1;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Focus exclusively on the top five topics. Solve 15-20 problems for each topic (Array, String, Hash Table, etc.), prioritizing Medium difficulty. Understand the underlying pattern of every solution. Don’t just memorize—categorize.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Speed.** Start solving problems that combine topics (e.g., Sort + Two Pointers, Hash Table + String). Begin timing yourself: 25 minutes for Medium, 40 for Hard. Participate in mock interviews. Start tackling the curated list of Palantir-specific problems to understand their problem flavor.

**Weeks 5-6: Refinement and Gaps.** In the final stretch, do full interview simulations (2 problems back-to-back). Revisit your mistakes from earlier weeks. Dedicate time to system design fundamentals, as Palantir interviews may touch on data-intensive system concepts. Ensure you can clearly articulate your thought process for every line of code you write.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** Always restate the problem in your own words, discuss edge cases (empty input, large values, duplicates), and outline your algorithm and its complexity _before_ writing a single character of code. Interviewers assess your problem-solving process.
2.  **Optimize with Purpose.** Start with a brute-force solution if necessary, but immediately follow with, "The complexity is O(n²). We can optimize this by using a hash map to reduce the lookup time." This shows intentionality.
3.  **Write Production-Ready Code.** Use meaningful variable names (`writeIndex` instead of `i`), add brief comments for complex logic, and check for edge cases in your code (null input, single-element arrays). This demonstrates you think about maintainable software.
4.  **Practice with Data-Intensive Problems.** Seek out problems that involve merging datasets, deduplicating records, time-series analysis, or efficient geographic queries. These align closely with Palantir’s domain.
5.  **Master One Language Deeply.** You must know your chosen language's standard library for collections (lists, maps, sets) and utilities (sorting, string manipulation) inside and out. Wasting time looking up syntax is a luxury you don’t have.

Consistent, focused practice on the core patterns is what will build the muscle memory needed to succeed. Start with the fundamentals, integrate them under time pressure, and refine your communication.
