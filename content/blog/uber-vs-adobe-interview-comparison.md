When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Uber and Adobe, while both major players, have distinct interview landscapes. Uber's process is known for its high volume and algorithmic rigor, often tied to real-world logistics problems. Adobe's interviews, while still challenging, tend to have a narrower scope with a stronger emphasis on core data structure manipulation and clean implementation. A strategic approach to studying their respective question sets is key.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers reveal a significant difference in scale and intensity. Uber's list, at 381 questions, is substantially larger than Adobe's 227. This volume alone suggests a broader potential range of problems to encounter.

The difficulty distribution is more telling. Uber's breakdown (54 Easy, 224 Medium, 103 Hard) shows a heavy skew towards Medium and Hard problems, with Hard questions making up over 27% of the total. This aligns with Uber's reputation for demanding, algorithmically complex interviews that often involve multi-step reasoning, system design components, or optimization.

Adobe's distribution (68 Easy, 129 Medium, 30 Hard) presents a different profile. While Medium problems are still the majority, the proportion of Hard questions is much lower (about 13%). The interview process here often prioritizes correctness, clarity, and the ability to handle edge cases over extreme algorithmic complexity. The higher count of Easy questions suggests you may encounter more straightforward "warm-up" problems or screening questions.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational trio: **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Uber's Focus:** The prominent inclusion of **Dynamic Programming** is a major differentiator. Many of Uber's problems related to routing, pricing, or resource optimization can be framed as DP problems (e.g., unique paths, coin change, knapsack variants). Expect graph problems (though not listed in the top tags) to appear frequently due to the nature of their business.
- **Adobe's Focus:** The explicit mention of **Two Pointers** highlights a preference for problems involving in-place array/string manipulation, searching, or sorting. Think problems like removing duplicates, sorting colors, or finding a target sum in a sorted array. Adobe's questions often test your ability to write efficient, clean, and bug-free code for manipulating data structures.

Here is a classic problem that could appear at either company, solved with a Hash Table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your goals and timeline.

**Prepare for Adobe first if:** You are earlier in your interview preparation journey or want to build confidence. The smaller question set and lower proportion of Hard problems make it a more manageable first target. Solidifying your skills on Array, String, Hash Table, and Two Pointer patterns from Adobe's list will give you a strong, versatile foundation. This core competency will directly transfer to a significant portion of Uber's problems.

**Prepare for Uber first if:** You are already comfortable with core data structures and are aiming for roles that require deep algorithmic problem-solving, or if Uber is your primary target. Tackling Uber's list will force you to grapple with a wider variety of advanced patterns, particularly Dynamic Programming and graph algorithms. Successfully working through this larger, more difficult set will make Adobe's focused list feel like a subset of what you've already mastered.

In practice, a blended approach is effective. Start by mastering the common core topics. Then, if targeting Uber, dive deep into DP and graph traversal. If targeting Adobe, drill down on Two Pointers and string manipulation problems. Ultimately, the strong foundational overlap means preparation for one company significantly benefits the other.
