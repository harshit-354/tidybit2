When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Adobe and Twitter (now X) represent two distinct interview landscapes—one with a massive, well-documented question bank and another with a more selective, design-focused approach. This comparison breaks down their key differences to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of documented problems.

**Adobe** has a vast repository of 227 questions, heavily weighted towards **Medium (129)** difficulty. This large, established set suggests a more traditional, algorithmic interview process where breadth of practice is a significant advantage. The high number of Easy (68) questions indicates they may test fundamental coding fluency early in the process, while the 30 Hard questions target senior or specialized roles.

**Twitter's** list is more curated at 53 total questions. The distribution skews even more towards **Medium (33)** difficulty, with a smaller proportion of Easy (8) and Hard (12) questions. This lower volume doesn't mean the interview is easier; it often indicates that questions are more frequently recycled or that the interview loop places a higher premium on other skills like system design and behavioral fit, with coding serving as a key but narrower filter.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, but with subtle differences in priority.

The top topics for both are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Adobe** explicitly lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic. This highlights a focus on efficient in-place array/string manipulation and is a classic pattern for Medium-difficulty problems.
- **Twitter's** fourth top topic is **Design**. This is a critical differentiator. While Adobe's list is dominated by pure algorithms, Twitter's inclusion of Design at this level signals that object-oriented design (like designing a parking lot or a deck of cards) or even preliminary system design concepts may be integrated into the coding rounds or as separate interviews.

Here is a common array problem that could appear at either company, solved with a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Example
// twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9); // Output: [0, 1]
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your timeline and the specific company focus.

**Start with Adobe if:** Your goal is to build a strong, broad algorithmic foundation. The enormous question bank provides extensive practice material across core topics. Succeeding here requires disciplined, wide-ranging study. Mastering Adobe's list will inherently cover a large portion of Twitter's algorithmic expectations, making it an excellent base of knowledge.

**Start with Twitter if:** You are interviewing with them imminently or want to prioritize quality over sheer quantity. Focus intensely on their Medium-difficulty problems and **dedicate significant time to Object-Oriented Design practice**. You must be ready to translate ambiguous requirements into clean, maintainable class structures, not just write efficient algorithms. Their smaller list allows for deeper, more repetitive practice of each problem type.

A strategic approach is to **use Adobe's list for foundational drill** and then **layer on Twitter's specific design focus**. This ensures you have both the algorithmic muscle memory and the design thinking required for Twitter's unique blend of questions.
