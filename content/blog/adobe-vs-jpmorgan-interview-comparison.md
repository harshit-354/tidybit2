When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies versus large financial institutions, candidates often face distinct question patterns and expectations. Adobe, as a traditional software product company, and JPMorgan Chase, as a leading investment bank with significant technology divisions, represent two common archetypes. While both assess core algorithmic proficiency, their interview structures, question volume, and emphasis differ notably. This comparison analyzes their technical interview questions based on aggregated data to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Adobe's question pool is substantially larger and more challenging. With 227 total questions categorized by difficulty (68 Easy, 129 Medium, 30 Hard), the volume is nearly three times that of JPMorgan. The distribution shows a strong focus on Medium-difficulty problems, which are typical for software engineering roles at product-based tech companies. These questions often test not just correctness but optimal solutions within constraints.

JPMorgan's pool is smaller and less difficult, with 78 total questions (25 Easy, 45 Medium, 8 Hard). The lower volume and reduced proportion of Hard questions reflect a different interview focus. For many technology roles in finance, the emphasis may lean more towards system design, financial knowledge, or practical coding skills rather than solving highly complex algorithmic puzzles under extreme time pressure. The presence of Hard questions, however, indicates that senior or specialized roles may still encounter challenging problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The core topics are nearly identical: **Array, String, Hash Table** are top for both. This strong overlap means mastering these fundamentals is universally beneficial.

**Adobe** adds **Two Pointers** as a primary topic. This technique is crucial for solving efficient array and string manipulation problems (e.g., finding pairs, removing duplicates, or palindrome checks) and is a hallmark of more algorithmically intensive interviews.

**JPMorgan** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic alongside the core three. While sorting is implicit in many algorithms, its explicit mention suggests direct questions on sorting algorithms, comparisons, or problems where sorting is the key preprocessing step.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common at Adobe)
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

# Example: Hash Table & Sorting (common at JPMorgan)
def top_k_frequent(nums: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    # Sort numbers by frequency, descending, and take top k
    sorted_items = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])
    return [num for num, _ in sorted_items[:k]]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Adobe)
function isPalindrome(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (s[left] !== s[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

// Example: Hash Table & Sorting (common at JPMorgan)
function topKFrequent(nums, k) {
  const freq = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }
  // Sort numbers by frequency, descending, and take top k
  return [...freq.entries()]
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .slice(0, k)
    .map((entry) => entry[0]);
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common at Adobe)
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Example: Hash Table & Sorting (common at JPMorgan)
public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    // Sort numbers by frequency, descending, and take top k
    List<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>(freq.entrySet());
    list.sort((a, b) -> b.getValue() - a.getValue());
    int[] result = new int[k];
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        result[i] = list.get(i).getKey();
    }
    return result;
}
```

The overlap suggests a preparation foundation: solve Array, String, and Hash Table problems from LeetCode's Easy and Medium categories. For Adobe, prioritize practicing the Two Pointers technique. For JPMorgan, ensure you understand sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) and their applications.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both, **start with Adobe's question list**. Preparing for its larger, more challenging pool will inherently cover the core topics and difficulty level needed for JPMorgan. Mastering Medium problems and Two Pointers techniques will make the typical JPMorgan question feel more manageable. The reverse is not true; preparing only for JPMorgan's scope may leave you underprepared for the depth and variety at Adobe.

After building competency with Adobe-style questions, tailor your final preparation for JPMorgan by reviewing specific company-tagged questions and ensuring comfort with sorting-related problems. For Adobe, allocate significant time for pattern recognition across its extensive Medium problem set and practice explaining optimized solutions.

Focus your study on the shared core, then branch out to the company-specific emphasis areas.
