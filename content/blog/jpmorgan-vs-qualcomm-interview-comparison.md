When preparing for technical interviews at top companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. JPMorgan and Qualcomm, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in their coding interview challenges. JPMorgan's dataset shows a heavier emphasis on medium-difficulty problems across core data structures, while Qualcomm's list is smaller but maintains a significant easy-difficulty component with a tighter focus on specific techniques like two pointers. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company's interview process.

**JPMorgan** lists **78 questions**, with a difficulty distribution of 25 Easy, 45 Medium, and 8 Hard. This larger volume suggests a broader question bank, meaning your preparation must be more comprehensive. The high concentration of Medium-difficulty problems (nearly 58% of the total) indicates that interviews are likely designed to test solid, practical problem-solving skills on common patterns rather than extreme algorithmic optimization. You should be very comfortable with the core concepts.

**Qualcomm** lists **56 questions**, with a distribution of 25 Easy, 22 Medium, and 9 Hard. While the number of Easy questions is identical to JPMorgan's, they represent a much larger proportion (about 45%) of Qualcomm's total. This suggests the initial screening or phone interview might lean towards foundational problems. The presence of 9 Hard questions, slightly more than JPMorgan's 8, hints that the bar for the most challenging on-site problems is similarly high, but you may encounter fewer medium-difficulty hurdles along the way.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, making these absolute fundamentals for either interview.

**JPMorgan's** top topics are **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting**. The prominence of Hash Table and Sorting points to a strong emphasis on problems involving lookups, frequency counting, and organizing data—skills highly relevant to financial data processing and transaction logic.

**Qualcomm's** top topics are **Array, Two Pointers, String, and Math**. The specific call-out of **Two Pointers** is significant. This indicates a clear preference for problems involving searching, pairing, or manipulating data within a single array or string, such as finding a sum pair, reversing, or dealing with sorted sequences. The inclusion of **Math** suggests a higher likelihood of numerical, bit manipulation, or computational geometry problems, aligning with hardware-adjacent software roles.

Here is a classic Two Pointers problem, highly relevant for Qualcomm:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing for both, **start with JPMorgan's list**. Its larger volume and strong medium-difficulty core will force you to build a broader, more robust foundation in Hash Tables and Sorting algorithms. Mastering these will automatically cover a significant portion of Qualcomm's Array and String requirements. Once this base is solid, you can pivot to sharpen specific skills for Qualcomm: drill into **Two Pointers** patterns and review fundamental **Math** problems (prime numbers, GCD, bitwise operations). This approach is efficient because JPMorgan's preparation casts a wider net, while Qualcomm's requires targeted refinement on top of that core.

Ultimately, JPMorgan's interview seems to test for consistent, reliable application of common data structures, while Qualcomm's delves deeper into efficient in-place algorithms and mathematical reasoning. Tailor your depth accordingly.
