When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes. Infosys and Twitter represent two distinct ends of the spectrum: a global IT services giant and a product-focused social media company. Their interview question banks on TidyBit—158 questions for Infosys and 53 for Twitter—highlight fundamental differences in their hiring approach, from volume and difficulty to core topics tested.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of questions indicates a key strategic difference. Infosys's large bank (158 questions) suggests a broader, more generalized screening process, likely used for a high volume of candidates across various experience levels and roles. The difficulty distribution (Easy: 42, Medium: 82, Hard: 34) is weighted toward Medium and Hard problems, pointing to an expectation of solid algorithmic competency.

In contrast, Twitter's curated list of 53 questions reflects a more focused, role-specific interview process for product engineering positions. The distribution (Easy: 8, Medium: 33, Hard: 12) is heavily concentrated on Medium difficulty, which is typical for companies assessing practical problem-solving under interview constraints. The lower volume doesn't mean easier interviews; it often means questions are more carefully selected to evaluate deeper understanding and design thinking.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, as seen in their shared top topics: **Array**, **String**, and **Dynamic Programming** (for Infosys). This overlap means mastering these areas provides a strong foundation for both.

**Infosys** includes **Math** as a top topic, which often involves number theory, combinatorics, or mathematical modeling in problems. **Twitter** uniquely lists **Design** and **Hash Table** as top topics. The "Design" tag is critical—it signifies Twitter's emphasis on system design or object-oriented design questions, which are essential for senior software engineering roles and building scalable systems.

A typical array problem for both might involve two-pointer techniques:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read-1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```javascript
// Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (!nums.length) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
// Two-pointer: Remove duplicates from sorted array
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

</div>

However, a Twitter-specific "Design" question could involve designing a simplified social graph or a rate limiter, which requires a different skill set entirely.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your target role and interview timeline.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your coding interview journey. The larger, broader question bank provides extensive practice across fundamental algorithms and data structures. Solving a wide range of problems, especially the many Medium-difficulty ones, will build a strong algorithmic foundation applicable to many companies. The inclusion of Math problems also encourages developing flexible problem-solving skills.

**Prepare for Twitter first if:** You are targeting senior engineering roles or product companies specifically. The focus on Medium problems and Design requires you to shift from pure algorithm solving to architecting systems and discussing trade-offs. You need to pair deep algorithmic practice (particularly on arrays, strings, and hash tables) with dedicated system design preparation.

A strategic approach is to **build your foundation with Infosys-style problems**—tackling a high volume of questions across arrays, strings, DP, and math. Once competent, **specialize with Twitter's list**, focusing on refining problem-solving clarity and layering on design skills. This path ensures you have both the breadth for general technical screens and the depth for product company interviews.
