Akuna Capital’s coding interviews are a rigorous test of algorithmic problem-solving and systems design, with a strong emphasis on performance and correctness. The process typically involves multiple rounds of technical screening, often featuring real-time coding on platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank, followed by more in-depth onsite interviews that can include domain-specific questions related to low-latency trading systems. Success requires not just solving problems, but doing so with optimal efficiency and clean code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 16 recent Akuna Capital coding questions reveals a stark distribution: only 1 Easy (6%), 7 Medium (44%), and a significant 8 Hard (50%) problems. This breakdown is telling. It indicates that Akuna’s interviews are designed to be challenging from the outset. You are unlikely to encounter simple warm-up questions. Instead, expect problems that require deep thought, careful implementation, and often the synthesis of multiple concepts. The high proportion of Hard problems suggests they are actively probing for candidates who can handle complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges under time pressure. Your preparation must be geared towards this high level of difficulty.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data highlights five critical areas. Mastery of these is non-negotiable.

- **Array:** Fundamental for representing data sequences. Problems often involve in-place manipulation, sliding windows, or prefix sums.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups. Essential for frequency counting, memoization in DP, and graph adjacency lists.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A cornerstone for optimization problems. You must be fluent in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, especially for Hard questions.
- **Graph Theory:** Critical for modeling relationships and networks. Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are the building blocks for traversal, cycle detection, and shortest-path algorithms.
- **Heap (Priority Queue):** Key for managing dynamic sets where you constantly need the "top K" or "minimum/maximum" element, common in scheduling and streaming data problems.

Given that Dynamic Programming and Graph Theory are prevalent in Hard problems, a deep understanding of their core patterns is essential. For DP, the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" pattern is a classic that teaches state definition and transition.

```python
def lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  if (!nums.length) return 0;
  // dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return Math.max(...dp);
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    // dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
    int maxAns = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxAns;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured, intensive approach is required to tackle Akuna's difficulty curve.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate the first two weeks to the top five topics. For each topic (Array, Hash Table, DP, Graph, Heap), solve 10-15 problems, mixing Medium and Hard. Focus on understanding the underlying patterns, not just memorizing solutions. Implement each solution in your primary language.
- **Week 3: Pattern Integration & Synthesis.** Akuna's Hard problems often combine topics. Spend this week on problems that require multiple techniques (e.g., DP on Graphs, Heaps with Hash Tables). Practice breaking down complex problem statements into manageable sub-problems.
- **Week 4: Mock Interviews & Performance.** Simulate the actual interview environment. Use a timer and a platform like CoderPad to solve 2-3 problems back-to-back in 60-90 minutes. Prioritize Akuna-specific and other trading firm questions. Focus on communicating your thought process clearly while writing bug-free code.
- **Weeks 5-6 (If Needed): Deep Dive & Weakness Repair.** Identify your remaining weak spots through mock interviews. Allocate time for a deep dive into those specific areas. Revisit the most challenging problems you've solved and re-implement them from scratch to ensure mastery.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize First, Code Second.** With so many Hard problems, a brute-force solution is rarely sufficient. Spend the first few minutes of any problem analyzing time and space complexity. Verbally state your optimization rationale before you start coding.
2.  **Practice Under Real Constraints.** Always code with a time limit and without an IDE's auto-complete. Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code for graphs, heaps, and DP tables from memory. This builds the muscle memory needed for a live screen-share.
3.  **Clarify Edge Cases Proactively.** Trading firms value robustness. Before finalizing your algorithm, explicitly list edge cases (empty input, large values, negative numbers). Mentioning these shows a thorough, production-quality mindset.
4.  **Explain the "Why" Behind Your Data Structure.** When you choose a min-heap or a adjacency list, briefly justify it. For example, "I'll use a min-heap here because we need constant access to the smallest element as we process the stream."

Success in an Akuna Capital coding interview is a function of targeted, high-difficulty practice and precise execution. Focus your energy on the patterns that matter most.
