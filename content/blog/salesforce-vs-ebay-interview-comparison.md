When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution can significantly optimize your study time. Salesforce and eBay represent two distinct interview landscapes—one with a broad, challenging question set and another with a more concentrated, moderate scope. This comparison breaks down their key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of questions. With **189 questions** cataloged, Salesforce's interview process covers a much wider range of problems. Its difficulty distribution (27 Easy, 113 Medium, 49 Hard) reveals a strong emphasis on **Medium-level problems**, which form the core of their technical screens and on-site interviews. The significant number of Hard questions indicates that roles, especially senior ones, may involve complex algorithmic challenges requiring optimized solutions.

In contrast, eBay's list is more focused with **60 questions**. Its distribution (12 Easy, 38 Medium, 10 Hard) shows a similar skew toward Medium problems, but with a much smaller absolute number of Hard questions. This suggests that while eBay certainly tests for proficiency, the algorithmic depth might not be as extreme as at Salesforce for most general software engineering roles. The smaller volume makes eBay's question set more approachable for targeted study.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The core overlapping topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for interviews at either company.

- **Salesforce** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a key topic. This aligns with its larger number of Medium and Hard questions, as DP is a common theme for complex problems. You must be prepared to solve problems involving sequences, paths, or optimization.
- **eBay** lists **Sorting** as a primary topic instead of DP. This implies a focus on problems where arranging data efficiently is crucial, often combined with the core topics of arrays and hash tables.

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, focusing on the core overlap of arrays and hash tables:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

A problem highlighting Salesforce's DP focus might be a classic like "Longest Increasing Subsequence," while eBay's sorting focus could lead to problems like "Merge Intervals."

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your goals and timeline.

If your target is **eBay**, start there. The focused question list allows you to achieve coverage faster. Solidify your skills on arrays, strings, hash tables, and sorting algorithms. Because the number of Hard problems is limited, ensure you can solve all Medium problems confidently before tackling the few Hard ones.

If your target is **Salesforce**, you must commit to a longer, more rigorous study plan. Begin with the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) but **prioritize Dynamic Programming early**. DP concepts often require more time to internalize. Practice a wide variety of Medium problems, as they form the bulk of the question pool, and do not neglect the substantial set of Hard questions.

For a generalist preparing for both or any major tech interview, a hybrid approach is effective: **Start with the eBay-focused list**. This builds a strong foundation in the universal topics. Once proficient, **expand your study to cover Salesforce's additional demands**, specifically diving deep into Dynamic Programming and practicing more complex problem variations. This method ensures you build from a solid base to advanced concepts efficiently.
