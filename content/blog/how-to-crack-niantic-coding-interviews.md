Niantic’s interview process for software engineering roles is designed to assess both your technical problem-solving skills and your ability to design scalable systems. The process typically involves a recruiter screen, one or two technical phone screens focusing on data structures and algorithms, and a final round of virtual on-site interviews. The on-site often includes a mix of coding, system design, and behavioral sessions. Understanding the specific patterns in their technical questions is the most direct path to success.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Niantic's coding questions show a clear pattern: 100% of their problems are rated at a **Medium** difficulty level. There are no Easy or Hard problems in their typical question set. This is a critical insight.

What does this mean for you? Niantic is not looking for trivial solutions or academic deep dives into esoteric algorithms. They are testing for **strong fundamentals applied to practical, non-trivial problems**. You must be proficient in translating a problem statement into a clean, efficient, and bug-free implementation under time pressure. The absence of Hard problems suggests they value robust, correct solutions over clever, complex optimizations that are prone to errors. Your goal is to consistently solve Medium problems within 20-25 minutes, with clear communication and optimal time/space complexity.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data reveals five key areas: **String**, **Hash Table**, **Linked List**, **Design**, and **Doubly-Linked List**. Mastery of these will cover the vast majority of their technical screens.

- **String:** Expect problems involving parsing, manipulation, and validation. A core pattern is using a hash table or two pointers to track character counts or positions.
- **Hash Table:** This is the most versatile tool. It's used for frequency counting, caching results (memoization), and providing O(1) lookups to optimize other algorithms.
- **Linked List & Doubly-Linked List:** These test your understanding of pointers/references and in-place modifications. The doubly-linked list is a classic data structure for designing caches (LRU Cache) or ordered lists.
- **Design:** This often refers to "Object-Oriented Design" problems, where you model real-world systems using classes and relationships. Think designing a game entity system, a location-based check-in service, or a deck of cards.

The most important combined pattern is implementing an **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache**, as it directly incorporates Hash Tables and Doubly-Linked Lists, a common Niantic topic.

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top topics. Solve 15-20 problems total, focusing on patterns. For example: 5 String problems (e.g., group anagrams, longest substring without repeating characters), 5 Hash Table problems, and 5 Linked List problems (including reversing, detecting cycles, and the LRU Cache). Implement each solution in your primary language.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Speed.** Start mixing topics. Practice problems that combine these areas, like a string parsing problem that requires a hash map for efficiency. Begin timing yourself. Aim to solve a fresh Medium problem in under 25 minutes, including explaining your approach and writing clean code. Do 2-3 such timed sessions per week.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Review.** Conduct at least 4-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Simulate the exact Niantic format: 45 minutes, one or two Medium problems, with verbal explanation. In the final week, stop learning new topics. Revisit and re-implement the problems you found most challenging, especially any design or LRU Cache variants. Ensure you can write the core patterns from memory.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second:** Before you write a single line of code, verbally outline your approach, including time and space complexity. Niantic interviewers want to follow your problem-solving process.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness:** Given the Medium-difficulty focus, a complete, correct, and readable solution is better than an optimal-but-flawed one. Handle edge cases explicitly.
3.  **Practice Object-Oriented Design:** Be ready to design a small system. Use clear class diagrams (even verbally), define key methods, and discuss trade-offs. Think about how you would model a game mechanic or a location-based service.
4.  **Know Your Chosen Language In-Depth:** You will be asked about your implementation choices. Be prepared to explain the time complexity of built-in operations (e.g., `dict` lookup in Python, `Map` in JavaScript, `HashMap` in Java).

Focus your preparation on consistent, clear execution of Medium-difficulty problems centered on Strings, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists. This targeted approach will give you the highest chance of success.
