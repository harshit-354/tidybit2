When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty profiles can dramatically increase your efficiency. DoorDash and eBay, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview landscapes. DoorDash's process is known for its high volume and difficulty, heavily emphasizing system design and on-the-job problem-solving. eBay's interviews, while still rigorous, tend to be more focused on core data structures and algorithms with a slightly more conventional structure. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topics to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a clear difference in scale and intensity. DoorDash has a larger question bank with **87 questions**, distributed as 6 Easy, 51 Medium, and 30 Hard. This 34% Hard question rate indicates a strong emphasis on complex problem-solving, often involving multi-step logic, optimization, and scenarios mimicking real-world delivery logistics. Expect questions that test not just correctness but also efficiency and edge-case handling under constraints.

In contrast, eBay's catalog contains **60 questions**, with a distribution of 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard. With only about 17% Hard questions, the overall difficulty leans more towards Medium. This suggests eBay's interviews are more accessible at the initial screening stages but still require mastery of medium-difficulty algorithms. The higher number of Easy questions might correspond to more frequent phone screens or initial assessments.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. The top three topics for both are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. This means a significant portion of your preparation for either company will be identical: mastering two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, substring problems, and efficient lookups.

- **DoorDash's Unique Focus:** DoorDash places a notable emphasis on **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, which is its fourth most frequent topic. This aligns with problems involving tree/graph traversal, pathfinding, and state exploration—common themes in mapping, routing, and menu/category systems.
  <div class="code-group">
  ```python
  # Example DFS skeleton for tree path problems
  def dfs(node, path, result):
      if not node:
          return
      path.append(node.val)
      if not node.left and not node.right:  # Leaf node
          result.append("->".join(map(str, path)))
      dfs(node.left, path, result)
      dfs(node.right, path, result)
      path.pop()  # Backtrack
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Example DFS skeleton for tree path problems
  function dfs(node, path, result) {
      if (!node) return;
      path.push(node.val);
      if (!node.left && !node.right) { // Leaf node
          result.push(path.join("->"));
      }
      dfs(node.left, path, result);
      dfs(node.right, path, result);
      path.pop(); // Backtrack
  }
  ```
  ```java
  // Example DFS skeleton for tree path problems
  public void dfs(TreeNode node, List<String> path, List<String> result) {
      if (node == null) return;
      path.add(String.valueOf(node.val));
      if (node.left == null && node.right == null) { // Leaf node
          result.add(String.join("->", path));
      }
      dfs(node.left, path, result);
      dfs(node.right, path, result);
      path.remove(path.size() - 1); // Backtrack
  }
  ```
  </div>

- **eBay's Unique Focus:** eBay's list highlights **Sorting** as a key fourth topic. This points to a focus on algorithms involving ordering, merging, and searching within sorted data, which is critical for catalog, search, and auction listing functionalities.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should depend on your target companies and interview timeline.

**Prepare for DoorDash first if:** You are aiming for roles at high-growth, operationally complex companies (like other delivery or logistics firms). The depth required for DoorDash—especially in DFS and Hard problems—will over-prepare you for eBay's core topics. Mastering DoorDash's question set builds resilience for tackling more intricate scenarios, which is beneficial for any interview. Prioritize graph/traversal algorithms and dynamic programming alongside the core Array/String/Hash Table problems.

**Prepare for eBay first if:** You are early in your interview practice cycle or have eBay interviews scheduled sooner. Conquering eBay's emphasis on Medium-difficulty Array, String, and Sorting problems will solidify your fundamentals. This strong base will then make it easier to layer on the advanced concepts (like sophisticated DFS and graph problems) needed for DoorDash. It's an effective strategy for building confidence and core competency.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in top topics means preparing for one inherently benefits you for the other. Start with the company whose difficulty profile best matches your current skill level to build momentum.
