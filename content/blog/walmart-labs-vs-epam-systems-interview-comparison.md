When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Walmart Labs and Epam Systems represent two distinct profiles in terms of interview question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topic emphasis. Analyzing their patterns helps you tailor your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data shows a significant difference in the breadth of documented questions and their challenge levels.

**Walmart Labs** has a much larger public question pool with **152 questions**. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium and hard problems: 105 Medium (M) and 25 Hard (H) questions, compared to just 22 Easy (E). This suggests their interviews are rigorous, often involving complex problem-solving and optimization. You must be comfortable with problems that extend beyond basic implementation.

**Epam Systems** has a smaller pool of **51 questions**. The distribution is skewed towards easier problems: 19 Easy and 30 Medium questions, with only 2 Hard. This indicates their technical screening might prioritize foundational knowledge, clean code, and problem-solving on standard topics, with less emphasis on highly optimized solutions for obscure scenarios.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies frequently test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. These are fundamental data structures for handling and manipulating data, making them essential for any interview prep.

**Walmart Labs** shows a strong emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is a complex topic that often forms the core of their harder questions. Mastering DP patterns (like knapsack, LCS, or Kadane's algorithm variations) is critical for success here.

**Epam Systems** prominently features **Two Pointers** as a core topic. This technique is crucial for solving many array and string problems efficiently (e.g., finding pairs, palindromes, or removing duplicates) and is a key indicator of their focus on algorithmic efficiency within a defined scope.

Here is a classic problem that could appear at either company, solved with both a Hash Table and a Two Pointers approach:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Sum - Hash Table approach (O(n) time, O(n) space)
def two_sum_hash(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Two Sum - Two Pointers approach (O(n log n) time, O(1) space if sorted in-place)
def two_sum_two_pointers(nums, target):
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)  # Requires sorting first
    left, right = 0, len(nums_sorted) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_sorted[left] + nums_sorted[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            # Need to find original indices, which adds complexity
            return [left, right]  # Simplified for example
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Sum - Hash Table approach
function twoSumHash(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Two Sum - Two Pointers approach
function twoSumTwoPointers(nums, target) {
  const sorted = [...nums].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let left = 0,
    right = sorted.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = sorted[left] + sorted[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      // Finding original indices is non-trivial
      return [left, right];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Sum - Hash Table approach
public int[] twoSumHash(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Two Sum - Two Pointers approach
public int[] twoSumTwoPointers(int[] nums, int target) {
    int[] sorted = nums.clone();
    Arrays.sort(sorted);
    int left = 0, right = sorted.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = sorted[left] + sorted[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            // Index mapping back to original array omitted for brevity
            return new int[]{left, right};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your current skill level and interview timeline.

If you are **new to technical interviews** or need to build confidence, start with **Epam Systems**. Their focus on Easy/Medium problems on core topics like Arrays, Strings, and Two Pointers provides a solid foundation. Mastering these will prepare you for a wide range of companies and build the muscle memory needed for more complex problems.

If you are **already comfortable with fundamentals** and are aiming for roles requiring advanced algorithmic skills, or if you have an interview with Walmart Labs scheduled, prioritize their question set. Dedicate significant time to **Dynamic Programming** and the larger set of Medium/Hard problems. The breadth of their question pool means you should practice extensively to recognize patterns.

Ultimately, the shared foundation in Array, String, and Hash Table problems means preparation for one company benefits the other. Begin with the core topics, then branch out into DP for Walmart Labs or deepen your Two Pointers technique for Epam.
