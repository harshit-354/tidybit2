When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically improve your efficiency. Salesforce and Expedia, while both prominent in their industries, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and core topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their technical interview question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer number of documented questions is the most immediate difference. Salesforce's list is significantly larger, with **189 questions** compared to Expedia's **54**. This volume suggests that Salesforce has a more extensive, and possibly more varied, historical question bank that candidates report on.

The difficulty distribution also reveals contrasting profiles:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The majority of questions are rated Medium (113), with a substantial number of Hard questions (49). This indicates a strong emphasis on complex problem-solving. The relatively low number of Easy questions suggests the interview process is designed to quickly move into challenging territory.
- **Expedia (E13/M35/H6):** The focus here is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty problems (35). The number of Hard questions is minimal (6), and Easy questions make up a notable portion. This points to an interview process that tests solid fundamentals and applied problem-solving, with less frequent forays into highly optimized, complex algorithms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures, as seen in their shared top topics: **Array, String, and Hash Table**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator lies in their fourth most frequent topic:

- **Salesforce: Dynamic Programming (DP).** The high frequency of DP aligns with its abundance of Medium and Hard questions. DP problems are classic tests of advanced problem decomposition, state definition, and optimization. Preparing for Salesforce necessitates a deep dive into DP patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and state machine DP.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP pattern (Coin Change)
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example DP pattern (Coin Change)
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example DP pattern (Coin Change)
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

- **Expedia: Greedy Algorithms.** This focus complements its profile of Medium-difficulty questions. Greedy problems test your ability to find locally optimal choices that lead to a global solution, often involving sorting and interval manipulation. They require strong reasoning to prove the greedy choice is valid.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Greedy pattern (Merge Intervals)
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
// Example Greedy pattern (Merge Intervals)
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (const interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// Example Greedy pattern (Merge Intervals)
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] = Math.max(merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by the breadth of coverage.

**Prepare for Salesforce first if you are interviewing at both.** The reason is coverage: mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) plus the advanced topic of Dynamic Programming will inherently cover the vast majority of what you'll see at Expedia. The rigorous practice for Medium/Hard Salesforce questions will make Expedia's Medium-focused Greedy and core topic questions feel more manageable. It's a more comprehensive foundation.

If you are only preparing for **Expedia**, your path is more focused. Drill deeply into Array, String, and Hash Table problems, then dedicate specific practice to common Greedy algorithm patterns (e.g., interval scheduling, task scheduling, greedy choice with sorting). You can afford to spend less time on the most complex DP problems.

Ultimately, a strong grasp of fundamental data structures is the universal key. Prioritize Salesforce's list for its broader, deeper challenge, or focus narrowly on Expedia's fundamentals-and-greedy combo for a targeted approach.
