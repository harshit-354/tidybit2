When preparing for technical interviews at major companies, understanding their specific focus areas and difficulty distributions is crucial for efficient study. IBM and JPMorgan Chase (JPMorgan) both assess core algorithmic and data structure knowledge, but their approach, volume, and emphasis differ significantly. This comparison breaks down their interview question profiles to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions associated with each company's interview process.

**IBM** has a significantly larger pool of **170 questions**, with a difficulty distribution of Easy (52), Medium (102), and Hard (16). This high volume, especially the dominance of Medium-difficulty problems, suggests that IBM's technical interviews are comprehensive and require broad, intermediate-level proficiency. Preparing for IBM means being ready to encounter a wide variety of problem statements within their core topics.

**JPMorgan** has a more focused pool of **78 questions**, distributed as Easy (25), Medium (45), and Hard (8). The smaller total and the similar emphasis on Medium-difficulty questions indicate a more concentrated interview loop. The goal here is depth within a narrower scope, testing solid fundamentals and common patterns rather than a vast array of edge cases.

In short, IBM's process is a marathon of breadth, while JPMorgan's is a sprint of depth on key concepts.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **String** manipulation, which are foundational to most coding interviews. **Sorting** algorithms and their applications are also a common thread. This shared foundation means mastering these topics is beneficial for interviews at either firm.

The key divergence is in the next most frequent topic:

- **IBM** prominently features **Two Pointers**. This pattern is essential for solving problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes, or searching for pairs.
- **JPMorgan** prominently features **Hash Table**. This indicates a strong focus on problems involving frequency counting, lookups, and ensuring uniqueness.

Consider this classic "Two Sum" problem, which highlights the different primary approaches:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two Pointers approach (effective for sorted input - common IBM style)
def two_sum_two_pointers(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Hash Table approach (works on unsorted input - common JPMorgan style)
def two_sum_hash_table(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Two Pointers approach (effective for sorted input - common IBM style)
function twoSumTwoPointers(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target)
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    else if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Hash Table approach (works on unsorted input - common JPMorgan style)
function twoSumHashTable(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Two Pointers approach (effective for sorted input - common IBM style)
public int[] twoSumTwoPointers(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Hash Table approach (works on unsorted input - common JPMorgan style)
public int[] twoSumHashTable(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should depend on your goals and timeline.

Prepare for **IBM first** if you are aiming for a software engineering role at a large tech company. The vast question pool and emphasis on algorithmic patterns like Two Pointers provide a rigorous, broad-based training ground. Succeeding here will build a strong foundation that makes preparing for JPMorgan's more focused set feel comparatively manageable. It's the "harder" preparation path in terms of scope.

Prepare for **JPMorgan first** if you are targeting finance or bank tech roles specifically, or if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. The concentrated question set allows you to deeply master a few critical data structures (especially Hash Tables) and problem patterns. This builds confidence and core competency, which you can then expand upon for a company like IBM that requires wider coverage.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in Arrays, Strings, and Sorting means effort spent on either company is transferable. Prioritize based on your target role, but know that mastering the combined topics from both lists will make you a strong candidate for a wide range of positions.
