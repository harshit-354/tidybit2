When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. TikTok and Snowflake represent two distinct types of companies—a social media giant and a cloud data platform—which is reflected in their technical interview content. While both assess core computer science fundamentals, their approach, volume, and emphasis differ significantly.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of documented questions. TikTok's list of 383 questions dwarfs Snowflake's 104. This doesn't necessarily mean TikTok asks more unique questions, but it suggests a larger, more active applicant pool contributing to a public repository, and potentially a broader question bank used in interviews.

Analyzing the difficulty breakdown is revealing:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The distribution is heavily weighted toward Medium (68%) and Hard (21%) questions. This indicates that passing a TikTok interview typically requires solving complex problems, often under significant time pressure. The high percentage of Hard questions suggests you may encounter at least one problem requiring deep algorithmic insight or tricky optimization.
- **Snowflake (E12/M66/H26):** The distribution is similar in shape but scaled down: 63% Medium, 25% Hard. While still challenging, the slightly lower proportion of Hard questions might indicate a marginally greater emphasis on correctness, clean code, and system design thinking alongside algorithmic problem-solving.

The volume implies that for TikTok, you might need to practice a wider variety of problems to avoid surprises. For Snowflake, deeper mastery of a slightly more focused set might be sufficient.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational building blocks of coding interviews:

- **Common Ground (Array, String, Hash Table):** These are universal. Expect questions on string manipulation, array traversal, and leveraging hash maps for efficient lookups at both companies.

  ```python
  # Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Common at both
  def two_sum(nums, target):
      seen = {}
      for i, num in enumerate(nums):
          complement = target - num
          if complement in seen:
              return [seen[complement], i]
          seen[num] = i
      return []
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Common at both
  function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      const complement = target - nums[i];
      if (map.has(complement)) {
        return [map.get(complement), i];
      }
      map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return [];
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Example: Two Sum (Hash Table) - Common at both
  public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
      Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          int complement = target - nums[i];
          if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
              return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
          }
          map.put(nums[i], i);
      }
      return new int[0];
  }
  ```

- **Key Differentiator - Dynamic Programming (TikTok) vs. Depth-First Search (Snowflake):**
  - **TikTok's** inclusion of **Dynamic Programming** as a top topic is significant. DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, unique paths) are classic "Hard" problem fodder and test optimal substructure and state transition thinking. This aligns with their high percentage of Hard questions.
  - **Snowflake's** emphasis on **Depth-First Search** (and by extension, tree/graph traversal) points to a focus on data structures and recursive/iterative navigation of hierarchical or networked data. This is highly relevant for a company whose product is built on structured and semi-structured data warehousing.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your target and timeline.

Prepare for **TikTok first** if you are aiming for companies with very high coding bars or if you have more time. Mastering TikTok's large volume and high difficulty, especially Dynamic Programming, will over-prepare you for many other companies, including Snowflake. The path from TikTok-level prep to Snowflake is smoother than the reverse.

Prepare for **Snowflake first** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey or are specifically targeting data-centric or infrastructure roles. The focused topic list and slightly (though not trivially) lower difficulty curve allow you to build deep competency in core data structures (arrays, strings, hash tables, trees/graphs) without the immediate pressure of the most complex DP problems. This creates a strong foundation you can later expand upon.

Ultimately, both require rigorous practice. Start with the company you are most interested in, but use the other's focus areas to identify and shore up your weaknesses. A strong candidate will be comfortable with the common topics and proficient in each company's specialty.
