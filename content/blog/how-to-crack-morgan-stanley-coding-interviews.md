Morgan Stanley’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving fundamentals. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focused on data structures and algorithms, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live coding environment. The questions are designed to assess not just whether you can find an answer, but how you structure your logic, communicate your approach, and handle edge cases under pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 53 recent Morgan Stanley coding questions reveals a clear distribution: 13 Easy (25%), 34 Medium (64%), and 6 Hard (11%). This breakdown is your strategic guide. The overwhelming focus on Medium-difficulty problems means your preparation must prioritize mastering core algorithmic patterns and their application. The goal is not to solve obscure puzzles, but to demonstrate consistent, clean, and efficient solutions to common problems. The presence of Hard questions, while smaller, signals that you must be prepared for a challenging follow-up or optimization step, often within a classic problem type.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-yield topics. Allocate your study time accordingly.

- **Array & Two Pointers:** Frequently combined. The two-pointer technique is essential for solving problems in-place with optimal time complexity, such as manipulating sorted arrays or sliding windows.
- **String:** Often involves parsing, comparison, or transformation. Common patterns include two-pointer checks for palindromes and using auxiliary data structures for anagrams.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. It's fundamental for problems involving frequency counting, pair finding, or memoization.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical topic for Medium and Hard questions. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in classic scenarios like maximizing profit or finding minimum paths.

The most important pattern to master is the **Two Pointers** technique, especially for array manipulation. Here is a classic example: removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place with O(1) extra space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # 'write' pointer tracks the position for the next unique element
    write = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[read - 1]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write  # New length
```

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  let write = 1;
  for (let read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
    if (nums[read] !== nums[read - 1]) {
      nums[write] = nums[read];
      write++;
    }
  }
  return write;
}
```

```java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int write = 1;
    for (int read = 1; read < nums.length; read++) {
        if (nums[read] != nums[read - 1]) {
            nums[write] = nums[read];
            write++;
        }
    }
    return write;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to the top topics: Array, String, Hash Table, and Two Pointers. Solve 2-3 problems daily from each category, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Ensure you can implement and explain the two-pointer code above and similar patterns from memory.
- **Week 3: Dynamic Programming & Advanced Patterns.** Tackle DP systematically. Start with the fundamentals (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs) before moving to classic 1D and 2D problems (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence). Revisit previous Medium problems to identify any that could have a DP solution.
- **Week 4: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new patterns. Use this week for full problem integration. Solve 2-3 mixed-topic Medium problems daily under timed conditions (45-60 minutes). Simulate the interview environment by verbally explaining your thought process as you code.
- **Weeks 5-6 (If Available): Depth & Company-Specific Practice.** This is for refinement and targeting. Re-solve any problems you struggled with. Dive into the 11% of Hard questions to understand the complexity ceiling. Finally, practice exclusively with known Morgan Stanley questions to acclimate to their style.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** The interviewer evaluates your process. Always restate the problem in your own words, ask clarifying questions about input boundaries, and verbally outline your algorithm and its complexity before writing a single line of code.
2.  **Optimize Deliberately.** Start with a brute-force solution if necessary, but immediately follow with, "I can optimize this by..." and implement the more efficient approach (usually involving a hash table or two-pointer technique). This demonstrates systematic thinking.
3.  **Prioritize Correctness and Clarity.** A bug-free, readable Medium solution is better than a buggy, complex Hard solution. Write clean code with sensible variable names. Handle edge cases explicitly (empty input, single element, large values).
4.  **Practice Under Real Constraints.** Use a plain text editor without auto-complete for some sessions. Time yourself. This builds the muscle memory and focus you'll need in the actual interview.

Success in a Morgan Stanley coding interview is built on precise execution of fundamentals, not theoretical genius. Master the core patterns, communicate your logic clearly, and structure your preparation to match their demonstrated focus on Medium-difficulty array, string, and hash table problems.
