UiPath coding interviews test your ability to translate business logic into efficient, clean code. While the company is known for Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the technical screen and onsite loops focus on core computer science fundamentals through algorithmic problem-solving. You'll typically face 1-2 coding rounds, often conducted on platforms like HackerRank or CoderPad, assessing your problem decomposition, coding speed, and communication.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 14 UiPath coding questions reveals a clear emphasis on intermediate to advanced problem-solving:

- **Easy:** 1 question (7%)
- **Medium:** 9 questions (64%)
- **Hard:** 4 questions (29%)

This distribution is telling. With nearly two-thirds of questions at a Medium level, UiPath expects you to reliably solve problems involving multiple steps or data structures. The significant 29% Hard component indicates they actively probe for depth—you must be prepared for complex scenarios involving optimization, nuanced edge cases, or combining multiple algorithmic patterns. Your goal is to master Medium problems to a point of fluency, ensuring you can tackle them confidently within the interview timeframe, which builds the foundation needed to approach Hard problems effectively.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form a focused study list. Prioritize these areas.

**Array & String Manipulation:** The bedrock of most problems. Expect slicing, searching, and in-place modifications.
**Hash Table:** The most crucial tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize solutions, often used for frequency counting or mapping relationships.
**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Essential for shortest path problems in grids (2D arrays) or tree/graph level-order traversal, common in automation scenario modeling.
**Dynamic Programming (DP):** A key differentiator for Hard problems. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in sequences or grids.

The most critical pattern to master is **Hash Table for frequency and complement tracking**, as it's the cornerstone for optimizing a vast array of problems, from Array two-sum variants to String anagrams.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Hash map: value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: Find indices for target 9 in [2, 7, 11, 15]
# Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map(); // Hash map: value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Find indices for target 9 in [2, 7, 11, 15]
// Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Hash map: value -> index
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Example: Find indices for target 9 in [2, 7, 11, 15]
// Output: [0, 1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable given the difficulty curve.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Patterns.** Dedicate this phase to core data structures (Array, String, Hash Table, Queue, Graph) and essential algorithms. Solve 2-3 classic problems for each pattern: two-pointers, sliding window, BFS/DFS, and basic DP (Fibonacci, climbing stairs). Use platforms like TidyBit to filter by topic and easy/medium difficulty.

**Weeks 3-4: Topic Depth & Medium Mastery.** Drill into the top UiPath topics. For each, solve 5-8 progressively harder Medium problems. For BFS, practice matrix traversal (rotting oranges, shortest path in binary matrix). For DP, move to medium challenges like coin change or longest increasing subsequence. Time your sessions.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Simulation.** Shift to solving complete, unfiltered Medium and Hard problems, particularly those tagged for UiPath. Participate in mock interviews. Practice articulating your thought process aloud before writing code. Revisit and re-solve the most challenging problems from previous weeks to ensure retention.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Treat the interview as a collaborative design session. Verbally walk through examples, discuss brute-force approaches first, then explain your optimization using data structures. This is as important as your working code.
2.  **Optimize with Hash Maps Early.** When you hear a problem involving finding pairs, checking for duplicates, or counting frequencies, your first thought should be "can a hash table solve this in O(n)?" It's the most common leap from a brute-force O(n²) to an optimal solution.
3.  **Practice Grid-Based BFS.** UiPath's domain in automation makes problems involving navigating or processing 2D grids (like simulating robot movements or process flows) highly relevant. Have the BFS template with direction vectors memorized.
4.  **Don't Ignore Brute-Force.** For Hard DP problems, start by describing the recursive brute-force solution. Explicitly point out the overlapping subproblems, then introduce memoization (top-down DP), and finally discuss the iterative (bottom-up) approach. This demonstrates deep understanding.
5.  **Test with Custom Examples.** Before finalizing your code, run through a small, non-trivial test case you design, including edge cases (empty input, single element, large values). Verbally walk through the execution to catch logical errors.

Mastering these patterns and executing this focused plan will position you strongly for the problem-solving demands of a UiPath coding interview.
