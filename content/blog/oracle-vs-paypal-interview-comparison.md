When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. Oracle and PayPal, while both being large technology and financial services companies, present distinct interview landscapes. Oracle, a legacy enterprise software giant, has a massive, well-documented question bank. PayPal, a leader in digital payments, has a more focused but still rigorous set of problems. A strategic comparison of their question volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis will help you prioritize your study time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer volume of questions. With **340 questions** cataloged, Oracle's interview process draws from a vast pool. The difficulty distribution (70 Easy, 205 Medium, 65 Hard) indicates a strong emphasis on **Medium-level problems**, which often require combining multiple concepts or optimizing an initial brute-force solution. Succeeding here demands broad exposure to many problem patterns.

In contrast, PayPal's list contains **106 questions**, roughly one-third of Oracle's. Its distribution (18 Easy, 69 Medium, 19 Hard) also skews heavily toward Medium difficulty. This suggests that while the scope of potential questions is narrower, the depth of understanding required for that core set is just as high. You can afford to go deeper on each problem type for PayPal.

**Example: A classic "Two Sum" problem, common at both companies.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** fundamentals. These are the building blocks for more complex algorithms and are non-negotiable areas of mastery.

The key differentiator is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. DP is a major topic for Oracle (implied by its listing), meaning you must prepare for problems involving optimal substructure and memoization, such as longest common subsequence or knapsack variations. This significantly increases the preparation breadth for Oracle.

PayPal's listed topics include **Sorting** instead of DP. This suggests a focus on problems where sorting is a crucial preprocessing step (e.g., merging intervals, finding anagrams, or two-pointer solutions on sorted arrays). While DP questions _could_ appear, the listed emphasis is on algorithmic reasoning with sorted data.

**Example: A problem emphasizing sorting, relevant for PayPal.**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **PayPal first**. Its more focused question bank allows you to build a strong, deep foundation in the core topics of Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting. Mastering these will make you competitive for PayPal and will also cover a substantial portion of Oracle's fundamentals. You can achieve readiness with a more concentrated effort.

Then, expand your study for **Oracle**. This phase involves tackling the additional breadth, specifically diving into **Dynamic Programming** and practicing a much larger volume of Medium and Hard problems to cover the wider array of patterns. Preparing for Oracle second is a logical expansion of the core skills you built for PayPal.

Ultimately, a solid grasp of data structures and algorithm patterns will serve you for both. Start focused, then broaden your scope.
