Athenahealth’s coding interviews assess practical problem-solving skills with a focus on data manipulation and algorithmic efficiency. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds featuring live coding on a shared editor, followed by discussions on approach and complexity. Questions are designed to mirror real-world scenarios in healthcare technology, such as processing patient records or optimizing data workflows.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, the question distribution is approximately:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (25%)
- **Medium:** 5 questions (63%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (13%)

This breakdown is strategic. The easy questions are warm-ups to verify basic coding competency. The medium questions form the core of the evaluation, testing your ability to apply standard algorithms to slightly novel problems under time pressure. The single hard question is a differentiator; it’s where top candidates demonstrate advanced problem-solving, often involving optimization or combining multiple concepts. Your goal is to consistently solve all easy and medium problems while making meaningful progress on the hard one.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics reflect the data-centric nature of Athenahealth’s systems.

- **Array:** Fundamental for representing sequential data. Master in-place operations, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. Essential for frequency counting and memoization.
- **String:** Closely tied to Array problems. Focus on parsing, validation, and pattern matching algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Critical for optimization problems. Identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- **Sorting:** Often a preprocessing step. Understand how to leverage sorted order for efficient solutions.

A key pattern that combines **Array** and **Hash Table** is the "Two Sum" approach, which is foundational for many follow-up problems.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this phase to the top five topics. Solve 15-20 problems per topic, starting with easy and progressing to medium. For each problem, implement the solution in your primary language, then analyze time and space complexity. Re-solve problems after 24 hours without looking at the solution to ensure retention.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Focus on medium-difficulty problems that combine topics, such as using a hash table to optimize a dynamic programming state or applying sorting to enable a two-pointer array scan. Complete 50-60 mixed medium problems. Begin timing your sessions (30-40 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.

**Week 5: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Identify weak spots—perhaps graph traversals or specific DP patterns—and drill 10-15 problems on those subtopics. Review all previously solved problems' edge cases.

**Week 6: Final Review and Hard Problems.** Revisit your list of solved problems, especially those you found challenging. Attempt 5-7 hard problems, focusing on deriving a working approach even if you don't reach the optimal solution. Practice clearly explaining your thought process aloud while coding.

## Key Tips

1.  **Clarify Before Coding.** Athenahealth problems may involve healthcare data constraints. Ask clarifying questions about input size, character sets, or edge cases (e.g., empty records, duplicate IDs) before writing a single line of code.
2.  **Optimize for Readability First.** Write clean, modular code with clear variable names. A readable, correct solution is better than a cryptic, optimal one. You can always refactor later if time permits.
3.  **Discuss Trade-offs.** When presenting your solution, explicitly state the time and space complexity. If you considered alternative approaches, briefly explain why you rejected them (e.g., "A brute force would be O(n²), but the hash table reduces it to O(n) with O(n) space.").
4.  **Test with Your Own Cases.** After coding, walk through 2-3 test cases, including an edge case. Verbally trace the logic to demonstrate correctness and catch off-by-one errors.

Success in these interviews comes from methodical practice on the right patterns and clear communication under pressure.
