When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Visa and Expedia, while both major companies, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. Visa's process is known for a heavier emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving across a broad set of data structures, whereas Expedia's process, while still rigorous, tends to be more focused and slightly less intense in its highest difficulty tier. Your preparation strategy should be tailored accordingly.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Visa's interview question bank is significantly larger and more challenging. With 124 total questions categorized as Easy (32), Medium (72), and Hard (20), candidates face a substantial volume. The high number of Medium and Hard problems indicates that interviews are designed to test robust problem-solving and optimization skills under pressure. You must be comfortable not just with solutions, but with deriving efficient, optimal approaches.

Expedia's question set is more compact at 54 questions, with a distribution of Easy (13), Medium (35), and Hard (6). The lower total volume and notably fewer Hard questions suggest a process that still rigorously tests core competencies, but may place a greater emphasis on clean implementation of fundamental concepts and logical reasoning, rather than on solving the most complex algorithmic puzzles. The focus is on demonstrating proficiency.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** problems. This forms a critical common core for preparation. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

- **Array/String Manipulation:** Expect problems involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and in-place modifications.
- **Hash Table Usage:** Essential for frequency counting, lookups, and solving problems related to pairs or duplicates.

The key divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Visa emphasizes **Sorting**, which often serves as a prerequisite for more complex algorithms (e.g., "Kth Largest Element," "Merge Intervals"). Expedia highlights **Greedy** algorithms, which test your ability to make locally optimal choices for a globally optimal solution (e.g., "Task Scheduler," "Jump Game").

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common overlapping pattern (Two-Pointer with Array)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common overlapping pattern (Two-Pointer with Array)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common overlapping pattern (Two-Pointer with Array)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Visa first** if you are interviewing at both companies or have time for only one study path. The reasoning is strategic: mastering Visa's broader and more difficult question set inherently covers Expedia's core requirements. If you can solve Visa's Medium and Hard problems on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting, you will be well-equipped for the majority of Expedia's questions. You would then only need to supplement your knowledge with specific Greedy algorithm patterns.

Prepare for **Expedia first** only if your interview is imminent and your foundational skills need reinforcement. The smaller, slightly less daunting question bank allows for a focused, confidence-building review of absolute essentials. You can solidify the core topics before potentially tackling the additional breadth and depth required for Visa.

Ultimately, a strong foundation in the shared topics—Array, String, and Hash Table—is your highest priority. Build from there based on your target company's specific profile.
