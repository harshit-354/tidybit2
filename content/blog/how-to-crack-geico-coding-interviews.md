Geico’s technical interview process for software engineering roles is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills. Candidates can expect a mix of online assessments and virtual on-site interviews, typically focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, data structure manipulation, and sometimes system design for more senior positions. The questions are known to be applied and relevant to real-world scenarios in insurance and financial technology.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of 21 Geico coding questions, the difficulty distribution is clear: 2 Easy (10%), 18 Medium (86%), and 1 Hard (5%). This breakdown is critical for your preparation strategy. It tells you that Geico’s interviews are overwhelmingly centered on **Medium-difficulty problems**. These questions require more than just recalling syntax; they demand a solid grasp of core algorithms and the ability to implement clean, efficient solutions under moderate time constraints. The single Hard question indicates that while advanced optimization might appear, it is not the primary gatekeeper. Your goal should be to master Medium-level problems across the key topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Hash Table, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming. You should prioritize these.

- **Array & String:** These are the fundamental data structures. Questions often involve traversal, in-place manipulation, or sliding window techniques.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity, frequently used in tandem with Array or String problems for efficient counting or mapping.
- **Greedy:** Problems where a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution. Common in scheduling or interval-based questions.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Essential for optimization problems with overlapping subproblems (e.g., "find the longest/maximum/minimum of something"). While less frequent than Array or Hash Table, a DP question is a high-impact opportunity to demonstrate advanced problem-solving.

The most important pattern to master is the **Hash Table for frequency counting**, as it underpins solutions across multiple topics. Here is a classic example: finding two numbers in an array that sum to a specific target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
// Example usage would return [0, 1] for twoSum(new int[]{2,7,11,15}, 9)
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured plan is non-negotiable. Here is a focused 4-week schedule; stretch it to 6 weeks if you need more depth.

- **Week 1: Foundation.** Drill Array, String, and Hash Table problems. Implement the Two Sum pattern (above), sliding window, and basic string reversal/manipulation. Solve 15-20 problems.
- **Week 2: Core Algorithms.** Focus on Greedy (e.g., interval scheduling, coin change greedy variants) and begin Dynamic Programming. Start with foundational DP like Fibonacci, then climb stairs, and move to 1D DP problems. Solve 15-20 problems.
- **Week 3: Integration & Practice.** Tackle Medium problems that combine topics—e.g., a String problem solved with a Hash Table and a Greedy approach. Complete 2-3 timed mock interviews focusing on Geico's topic distribution.
- **Week 4: Refinement & Review.** Re-solve previously challenging problems. Systematically review each top topic's patterns. Complete another 2-3 mock interviews, ensuring you can clearly explain your thought process.

## Key Tips

1.  **Master the Mediums:** Do not get sidetracked by exotic Hard problems. Your ROI is highest in becoming flawless on Medium-difficulty questions from the top five topics.
2.  **Communicate Your Process:** Geico interviewers evaluate how you think. Verbally walk through your approach, discuss trade-offs (time vs. space complexity), and mention edge cases before you start coding.
3.  **Test with Examples:** Always run your code against a simple example, a edge case (empty input, single element), and a more complex case. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches bugs.
4.  **Practice with Constraints:** Simulate the interview environment by using a timer and a plain text editor without auto-complete for some of your practice sessions.

Success in Geico's interviews comes from consistent, topic-focused practice on Medium problems and clear communication. Start with the core patterns and build from there.
