Oscar Health’s technical interview process is designed to assess problem-solving skills and coding proficiency relevant to building and scaling their healthcare technology platform. Candidates can expect a mix of algorithmic coding challenges, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or CoderPad, followed by deeper technical discussions. The focus is on clean, efficient code and the ability to reason through complex problems—especially those involving data processing and optimization, which are core to their insurance and care management systems.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Oscar Health’s coding questions skew significantly toward advanced problem-solving. The breakdown is: **0% Easy, 67% Medium, and 33% Hard**. This distribution sends a clear message: you must be prepared for substantial complexity. An "Easy" warm-up is unlikely. Interviews are built to test your upper limit, often starting with a multi-layered Medium problem or diving directly into a Hard challenge that requires optimal dynamic programming or sophisticated string manipulation. This pattern indicates they prioritize candidates who can handle ambiguous, high-stakes problems under pressure—mirroring the real-world challenges of managing healthcare data and systems.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data reveals two dominant areas: **String** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Mastering these is non-negotiable.

**String Manipulation**
Expect problems involving parsing, transformation, comparison, or encoding of textual data, which is ubiquitous in healthcare for processing records, claims, or user inputs. Key patterns include sliding window, two-pointer techniques, and efficient hashing.

**Dynamic Programming**
This is the cornerstone of their hardest problems. DP is used for optimization—think minimizing costs, maximizing coverage, or finding optimal pathways, all relevant to insurance logistics. The most critical pattern is **DP on strings**, such as edit distance or longest common subsequence.

Here is a fundamental DP pattern, solving the classic "Longest Common Subsequence" problem, which combines both top topics:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    # DP table with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[m][n]
```

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
  const m = text1.length,
    n = text2.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[m][n];
}
```

```java
public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
    int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();
    int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

Given the difficulty curve, a rigorous, focused plan is essential.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate this phase to Strings and Dynamic Programming. Solve 15-20 problems on each topic, starting with Medium difficulty. For DP, internalize the patterns for 1D (like knapsack) and 2D (like LCS) problems. For strings, master sliding window for substrings and two-pointers for comparisons.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Problem Integration**
Shift to solving Hard problems that combine these topics, such as "Edit Distance" or "Regular Expression Matching." Practice under timed conditions (45-50 minutes per problem). Simultaneously, review other important areas like Graphs and Arrays, as they may appear in conjunction with the main topics.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Company-Specific Practice**
Conduct at least 6-8 mock interviews simulating Oscar’s format—no Easy problems, back-to-back Medium and Hard questions. Use platforms to practice on their past questions. Focus intensely on articulating your thought process, edge case consideration, and writing production-ready code with clear variable names.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** From the moment you see the problem, talk through your assumptions, initial brute-force thoughts, and optimization process. Silence is a red flag. Explain your DP state definition and transition logic aloud.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Premature Optimization.** With Hard problems, a working brute-force or suboptimal solution is better than no solution. Get a functional version running first, then analyze bottlenecks. For Oscar, a correct, well-explained O(n²) solution can be a strong starting point.
3.  **Test with Healthcare-Relevant Edge Cases.** When testing your code, think like a healthcare developer: empty strings, very long strings (simulating large data batches), Unicode characters (for names), and input with unexpected formatting. Explicitly stating these tests shows domain-aware thinking.
4.  **Write Clean, Modular Code.** Use helper functions for complex logic (e.g., a separate function to check a substring property). This improves readability and makes the code easier to debug and explain. Avoid clever one-liners that obfuscate your intent.

Success in an Oscar Health interview requires targeted preparation for high-complexity problems, with a sharp focus on string algorithms and dynamic programming. Practice under pressure, communicate clearly, and write robust code.
