PhonePe’s technical interviews frequently include graph theory because their core business—payments, financial services, and distributed systems—relies heavily on networked data models. Whether it’s modeling user transaction networks, detecting fraud cycles, optimizing routing for fund transfers, or managing dependencies in microservices, graph algorithms provide the essential toolkit. With 14 out of 102 total coding problems tagged for Graph Theory on their platform, it’s a domain you cannot skip. Mastering these concepts demonstrates you can handle the interconnected, scalable systems that process millions of transactions daily.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

PhonePe’s graph problems tend to be applied, focusing on real-world scenarios rather than abstract theory. You can expect the following categories:

1. **Traversal and Search:** Problems involving BFS or DFS to explore networks, such as finding connected components in a user graph or the shortest path steps in a service mesh.
2. **Cycle Detection:** Critical for financial systems to identify potential fraud loops or deadlocks in transaction dependencies. Both directed and undirected graph variations appear.
3. **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Applied to routing problems, like minimizing hops between services or optimizing cost paths in a network. Dijkstra’s algorithm is common.
4. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):** Used for dynamically connecting components, which is useful in clustering transactions or merging user groups efficiently.
5. **Topological Sorting:** Relevant for scheduling tasks with dependencies, such as processing sequenced financial operations or build systems.

The problems often present disguised graphs—where you must first model the given data (like lists of edges, adjacency lists, or matrices) into a graph structure before solving.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Start by solidifying the fundamentals: graph representations (adjacency list vs. matrix), BFS, DFS, and the core algorithms listed above. Practice translating problem statements into graph models. Implement each algorithm from scratch multiple times until it’s automatic.

A key pattern to internalize is **Breadth-First Search for shortest paths in unweighted graphs**. Below is a template for finding the shortest path length from a start node to a target in an undirected graph using BFS. This pattern is versatile for many PhonePe scenarios, like finding the minimum number of transaction hops.

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_shortest_path(adj_list, start, target):
    if start == target:
        return 0
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    distance = {start: 0}

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if neighbor == target:
                    return distance[node] + 1
                visited.add(neighbor)
                distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return -1  # No path exists
```

```javascript
function bfsShortestPath(adjList, start, target) {
  if (start === target) return 0;
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set([start]);
  const distance = { [start]: 0 };

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    for (const neighbor of adjList[node]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        if (neighbor === target) return distance[node] + 1;
        visited.add(neighbor);
        distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
  return -1; // No path exists
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GraphBFS {
    public int bfsShortestPath(List<List<Integer>> adjList, int start, int target) {
        if (start == target) return 0;
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[adjList.size()];
        int[] distance = new int[adjList.size()];

        queue.offer(start);
        visited[start] = true;
        distance[start] = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            for (int neighbor : adjList.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    if (neighbor == target) return distance[node] + 1;
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return -1; // No path exists
    }
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

1. **Foundation:** Begin with basic traversals (BFS/DFS) on adjacency lists. Solve problems about connected components and simple path existence.
2. **Core Algorithms:** Move to shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford for weighted graphs), cycle detection, and topological sort.
3. **Advanced Patterns:** Tackle union-find applications, minimum spanning trees (Kruskal’s, Prim’s), and more complex problems like finding strongly connected components.
4. **PhonePe-Specific:** Finally, work through all 14 Graph Theory problems on TidyBit’s PhonePe track. Simulate interview conditions: time yourself and explain your approach aloud.

Consistency is crucial. Aim to solve at least one graph problem daily in the weeks leading to your interview.
