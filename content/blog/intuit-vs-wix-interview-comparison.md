When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial for efficient study. Intuit and Wix, while both established technology companies, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question libraries on TidyBit. Intuit's list is larger and more challenging, while Wix's is more compact with a slightly different emphasis. This comparison breaks down the key differences to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a clear difference in both the quantity and the difficulty distribution of questions.

**Intuit** presents a larger and more challenging question bank with **71 total questions**. The difficulty breakdown is 10 Easy, 47 Medium, and 14 Hard questions. This 66% Medium rate is standard, but the nearly 20% Hard question rate is significant. It indicates that Intuit interviews are likely to include at least one complex problem requiring advanced algorithmic thinking, particularly in areas like Dynamic Programming.

**Wix** has a smaller, somewhat more approachable set with **56 total questions**. The breakdown is 16 Easy, 31 Medium, and 9 Hard questions. While still challenging, the proportion of Hard questions is lower (~16%), and the proportion of Easy questions is higher (~29%). This suggests Wix's process may place a slightly stronger initial emphasis on foundational problem-solving before escalating to highly complex algorithms.

```python
# Example of a potential "Medium" level problem common to both:
# Two Sum (using Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example of a potential "Medium" level problem common to both:
// Two Sum (using Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example of a potential "Medium" level problem common to both:
// Two Sum (using Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core data structures, but with one major divergence.

**Shared Core Topics:** **Array**, **String**, and **Hash Table** are top topics for both. You can expect frequent questions involving manipulation, iteration, and lookup operations on these fundamental structures. Mastering these is non-negotiable for either interview.

**Key Divergence:** The most notable difference is **Intuit's strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming (DP)**, which is not listed among Wix's top four topics. DP problems (like knapsack, longest common subsequence, or coin change) are classic Hard and Medium challenges that test optimization and state management. **Wix's list highlights Depth-First Search (DFS)**, indicating a greater focus on graph and tree traversal problems, which are also common in Medium-difficulty interviews.

```python
# Example highlighting Intuit's DP focus: Climbing Stairs
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

# Example highlighting Wix's DFS focus: Number of Islands
def num_islands(grid):
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r, c+1)
        dfs(r, c-1)

    count = 0
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                dfs(r, c)
                count += 1
    return count
```

```javascript
// Example highlighting Intuit's DP focus: Climbing Stairs
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

// Example highlighting Wix's DFS focus: Number of Islands
function numIslands(grid) {
  function dfs(r, c) {
    if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === "0") return;
    grid[r][c] = "0";
    dfs(r + 1, c);
    dfs(r - 1, c);
    dfs(r, c + 1);
    dfs(r, c - 1);
  }

  let count = 0;
  const rows = grid.length,
    cols = grid[0].length;
  for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
      if (grid[r][c] === "1") {
        dfs(r, c);
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
// Example highlighting Intuit's DP focus: Climbing Stairs
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

// Example highlighting Wix's DFS focus: Number of Islands
public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                dfs(grid, i, j);
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

private void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= grid.length || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == '0') return;
    grid[r][c] = '0';
    dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
    dfs(grid, r, c - 1);

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your interview timeline and the specific company's demands.

**Prepare for Intuit first if:** You are interviewing with both, or if you want to tackle the more demanding set initially. Mastering Intuit's list inherently covers the core (Array, String, Hash Table) needed for Wix and forces you to become proficient in **Dynamic Programming**, which is a high-leverage area for many tech interviews. The higher volume and proportion of Hard questions mean this preparation will be more rigorous.

**Prepare for Wix first if:** It is your only upcoming interview, or you are building foundational confidence. The slightly lower difficulty curve allows you to solidify core data structure skills and graph traversal (DFS) before moving on to more advanced optimization problems. It's a strong, focused list that covers essential patterns.

In either case, start with the shared core: drill problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables until you can solve Medium variants consistently. Then branch into the company-specific specialty: DP for Intuit, DFS and graph problems for Wix.

For targeted practice, visit the company question pages: [Intuit](/company/intuit) and [Wix](/company/wix).
