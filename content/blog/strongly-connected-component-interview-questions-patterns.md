Strongly Connected Component (SCC) questions are a hallmark of the hardest graph problems in technical interviews. While not common, their appearance is a strong signal: the interviewer is testing deep knowledge of graph theory and advanced algorithm design. Mastering SCCs means you can decompose complex directed graphs into their fundamental cycles and dependencies, a skill critical for systems involving web crawlers, compiler optimization, data lineage, and social network analysis. If you encounter one, you're likely in a final-round interview for a role demanding expert-level problem-solving.

## Common Patterns

SCC problems are built on Tarjan's Algorithm or Kosaraju's Algorithm. Interview questions typically don't ask for a vanilla SCC decomposition; they use it as a foundational step to solve a larger, more complex problem.

**Pattern 1: Condensation Graph (DAG of SCCs)**
After identifying all SCCs, you contract each component into a single node, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This simplifies problems about reachability or dependency resolution between groups of nodes.

**Pattern 2: Source and Sink SCCs in the Condensation Graph**
Many problems hinge on finding SCCs with zero incoming edges (source SCCs) or zero outgoing edges (sink SCCs) in the condensation DAG. This is key for problems about minimal connections or broadcast points.

**Pattern 3: 2-SAT as an SCC Problem**
The 2-Satisfiability problem can be modeled as an implication graph and solved by checking if a variable and its negation reside in the same SCC. This is a classic hard problem pattern.

Here is a template for Tarjan's Algorithm, the most common implementation in interviews:

```python
def tarjan_scc(n, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    index = 0
    stack = []
    on_stack = [False] * n
    indices = [-1] * n
    lowlink = [0] * n
    result = []

    def strongconnect(v):
        nonlocal index
        indices[v] = lowlink[v] = index
        index += 1
        stack.append(v)
        on_stack[v] = True

        for w in graph[v]:
            if indices[w] == -1:
                strongconnect(w)
                lowlink[v] = min(lowlink[v], lowlink[w])
            elif on_stack[w]:
                lowlink[v] = min(lowlink[v], indices[w])

        if lowlink[v] == indices[v]:
            component = []
            while True:
                w = stack.pop()
                on_stack[w] = False
                component.append(w)
                if w == v:
                    break
            result.append(component)

    for v in range(n):
        if indices[v] == -1:
            strongconnect(v)
    return result
```

```javascript
function tarjanSCC(n, edges) {
  const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  for (const [u, v] of edges) graph[u].push(v);

  let index = 0;
  const stack = [];
  const onStack = new Array(n).fill(false);
  const indices = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const lowlink = new Array(n).fill(0);
  const result = [];

  function strongconnect(v) {
    indices[v] = lowlink[v] = index;
    index++;
    stack.push(v);
    onStack[v] = true;

    for (const w of graph[v]) {
      if (indices[w] === -1) {
        strongconnect(w);
        lowlink[v] = Math.min(lowlink[v], lowlink[w]);
      } else if (onStack[w]) {
        lowlink[v] = Math.min(lowlink[v], indices[w]);
      }
    }

    if (lowlink[v] === indices[v]) {
      const component = [];
      let w;
      do {
        w = stack.pop();
        onStack[w] = false;
        component.push(w);
      } while (w !== v);
      result.push(component);
    }
  }

  for (let v = 0; v < n; v++) {
    if (indices[v] === -1) strongconnect(v);
  }
  return result;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TarjanSCC {
    public List<List<Integer>> scc(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] e : edges) graph[e[0]].add(e[1]);

        int index = 0;

    private void strongconnect(int v, List<Integer>[] graph, Stack<Integer> stack,
                               boolean[] onStack, int[] indices, int[] lowlink,

                lowlink[v] = Math.min(lowlink[v], lowlink[w]);
            } else if (onStack[w]) {
                lowlink[v] = Math.min(lowlink[v], indices[w]);

            } while (w != v);
            result.add(component);
        }
    }

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a stark split: 100% of categorized SCC problems are labeled **Hard**. This is accurate. In an interview context, an "Easy" SCC question does not exist. A "Medium" would be a direct implementation of Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm, which is still uncommon. The vast majority are Hard problems where SCC decomposition is the first, non-trivial step in a multi-stage solution. You must not only flawlessly recall the algorithm but also creatively apply its output—the list of components and the resulting DAG—to solve a second-order logic or optimization problem. This difficulty profile means you should only prioritize SCCs if you are targeting top-tier companies and have already mastered core data structures.

## Which Companies Ask Strongly Connected Component

These companies are known for asking advanced graph problems in specific roles:

- [Amazon](/company/amazon) (for senior SDE roles in distributed systems)
- [Google](/company/google) (for infrastructure or search ranking teams)
- [Argo AI](/company/argo-ai) / [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) (for core software or financial data pipeline roles)
- [Sprinklr](/company/sprinklr) (for senior backend positions)

## Study Tips

1.  **Memorize One Algorithm Deeply.** Choose Tarjan's (more interview-common) or Kosaraju's. Be able to derive it on a whiteboard, explain the role of `index` and `lowlink` (for Tarjan), and justify why it runs in O(V+E) time.
2.  **Practice Building the Condensation Graph.** The immediate step after SCC decomposition is building the DAG where each node is a component. Write this helper function repeatedly until it's automatic.
3.  **Solve Classic Problems.** Don't just study the algorithm. Solve known hard problems that use it, such as "Critical Connections" variants, "2-SAT" transformations, or "Number of Ways to Build a Network" style problems.
4.  **Recognize the Prompt.** Keywords like "mutual dependencies," "all nodes can reach each other," "propagate to all components," or "circular dependencies" in a directed graph context are strong hints an SCC approach is needed.

SCC questions are a high-risk, high-reward topic. Solidify your foundation with targeted practice.
