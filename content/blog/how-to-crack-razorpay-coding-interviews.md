Razorpay’s coding interviews are a direct test of your problem-solving speed and precision. The process typically involves one or two focused coding rounds where you’ll be given algorithmic problems to solve on a whiteboard or in a shared editor. The emphasis is on clean, efficient code and clear communication of your thought process. Success hinges on recognizing patterns quickly and implementing robust solutions under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Razorpay interview questions reveals a clear pattern: **69% are of Medium difficulty**. This distribution (Easy: 23%, Medium: 69%, Hard: 8%) signals that their primary goal is to assess strong foundational competency. They are not trying to weed out candidates with obscure, ultra-complex problems, but rather to consistently identify those who can reliably solve the standard, challenging problems that form the core of software engineering work. You must be exceptionally proficient at Medium-level questions. The single Hard problem likely serves as a tiebreaker for top candidates or for more senior roles. Your preparation should be laser-focused on mastering Medium-difficulty problems across the key topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of recurring themes. Prioritize these areas in your study.

- **Array & Hash Table:** The most fundamental duo. Expect problems involving data manipulation, finding relationships, or optimizing lookups. The Hash Table is often the key to turning an O(n²) solution into O(n).
- **Sorting:** Rarely the final answer but a critical preprocessing step. Many array and two-pointer solutions depend on a sorted input. Know the trade-offs of common sorting algorithms.
- **Binary Search:** Applied far beyond searching in a simple sorted array. Master its use in problems involving sorted matrices, finding optimal values, or in scenarios where you can make a "guess and check" monotonic function.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A major differentiator. Razorpay's problems frequently test the ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems. This is where many candidates stumble.

The most crucial pattern to master is **using a Hash Table to optimize array lookups**, often combined with the prefix sum technique for subarray problems. Here is a classic example: finding a subarray that sums to a target `k`.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, k):
    prefix_sum = 0
    sum_count = {0: 1}  # A sum of 0 has occurred once (before the start)
    count = 0

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # If (prefix_sum - k) exists, a subarray summing to k ends here
        count += sum_count.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # Record the current prefix sum
        sum_count[prefix_sum] = sum_count.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1
    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumMap = new Map();
  sumMap.set(0, 1); // A sum of 0 has occurred once
  let count = 0;

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    // If (prefixSum - k) exists, a subarray summing to k ends here
    if (sumMap.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumMap.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    // Record the current prefix sum
    sumMap.set(prefixSum, (sumMap.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>();
    sumMap.put(0, 1); // A sum of 0 has occurred once
    int count = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        // If (prefixSum - k) exists, a subarray summing to k ends here
        count += sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        // Record the current prefix sum
        sumMap.put(prefixSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.** Dedicate this phase to Arrays, Hash Tables, and Sorting. Solve 15-20 problems for each topic, starting with Easy but quickly moving to Medium. Implement every solution from scratch. The goal is to make the use of a hash map for O(1) lookups second nature.

**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns & Dynamic Programming.** This is the critical phase. Spend one week deeply on Binary Search patterns (search in rotated array, finding boundaries). The next week is entirely for Dynamic Programming. Start with the classics—climbing stairs, coin change, longest increasing subsequence—and understand the recurrence relation before writing code. Then move to 2D DP problems like knapsack or edit distance.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration & Mock Interviews.** Stop learning new topics. Now, solve mixed-topic Medium problems under a 30-minute timer. Use the Razorpay-specific question list on TidyBit. Complete at least 2-3 mock interviews with a peer or mentor, simulating the real environment: state the problem, explain your approach, code, and test with edge cases. This builds the mental stamina and communication skills required for the actual interview.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate First, Code Second.** When you receive a problem, don't dive into silence. Verbally walk through your initial thoughts, a brute-force approach, and then identify the bottlenecks. Explain how you plan to optimize (e.g., "Here, the O(n²) nested loop is the issue, so I'll use a hash map to store seen values to reduce lookup time to O(1)."). This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** A correct, well-explained solution using a standard approach is far better than a buggy, "optimal" one. Write clean, readable code with sensible variable names. Handle edge cases (empty input, single element, large values) explicitly during your walkthrough.
3.  **Practice on Paper/Whiteboard.** You may not have the luxury of an IDE with autocomplete. Regularly practice writing syntactically correct code on paper or a whiteboard. This reinforces language syntax and catches dependencies you normally take for granted.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before starting, ask questions to define the problem scope. "Can the input be empty?" "Are the numbers all integers?" "What should be returned if no solution exists?" This shows attention to detail and prevents you from solving the wrong problem.

Mastering these patterns and executing this disciplined strategy will place you firmly in the cohort of candidates who can reliably solve the Medium-difficulty problems that Razorpay favors. Focus your energy there.
