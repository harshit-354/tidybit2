When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Salesforce and Visa, while both major players requiring strong coding skills, present distinct interview landscapes. Salesforce, a cloud software leader, emphasizes complex problem-solving across a broader range of difficulties. Visa, a global payments technology company, focuses on more foundational data structure manipulation. A strategic preparation plan should account for their differences in question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topic focus.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data reveals a significant difference in scope and depth between the two companies' known question pools.

**Salesforce** has a larger repository with **189 questions**, categorized as 27 Easy, 113 Medium, and 49 Hard. This breakdown indicates a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems, which constitute about 86% of their question pool. Preparing for Salesforce requires a strong comfort with intricate algorithmic challenges, particularly in dynamic programming and advanced data structure applications. The high number of Hard questions suggests you may encounter multi-step problems that combine several concepts.

**Visa** has a more compact set of **124 questions**, with a distribution of 32 Easy, 72 Medium, and 20 Hard. Here, Medium-difficulty problems are the core, making up about 58% of the set, with a more modest proportion of Hard questions (16%). This points to an interview process that rigorously tests proficiency in core concepts and clean implementation, rather than pushing deeply into the most complex algorithmic territories. The focus is on reliability, accuracy, and efficiency with standard tools.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** manipulation. These are fundamental building blocks for most coding interviews. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either company.

The key differentiator is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This topic is explicitly noted for Salesforce but not for Visa's listed core topics. Salesforce's significant number of Hard questions often involves DP patterns like knapsack, longest common subsequence, or state-machine DP. You must prepare for this.

**Visa** explicitly lists **Sorting** as a core topic alongside the big three. This implies a focus on problems involving searching, merging, or optimizing sorted data, and a need to know the intricacies and trade-offs of different sorting algorithms.

**Example: A Common "Two Sum" Variation (Hash Table)**

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are interviewing at both, **start with Visa**. Its narrower topic focus and lower proportion of Hard questions allow you to build a solid, confident foundation in the universal basics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting). Achieving fluency here will make you competitive for Visa and establish the core skills needed for Salesforce.

Once comfortable with Visa's scope, **transition to Salesforce preparation**. This phase should be dedicated to tackling Medium-Hard problems and, critically, drilling **Dynamic Programming**. Practice common DP patterns extensively. The larger question volume means you should prioritize pattern recognition over memorization. Since Salesforce's question set encompasses Visa's core topics, this two-stage approach ensures you layer advanced concepts onto a strong base.

Ultimately, Visa tests for robust fundamental engineering, while Salesforce assesses the ability to navigate more open-ended, computationally complex problems. Tailor your study depth accordingly.
