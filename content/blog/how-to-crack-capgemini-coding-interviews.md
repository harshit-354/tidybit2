Capgemini’s coding interviews typically assess foundational problem-solving skills through online assessments and technical interviews. The focus is on practical application of core data structures and algorithms, often with a tilt toward efficiency and clean implementation. Understanding the specific distribution of question types and topics is your first strategic advantage.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 36 recent Capgemini-style questions reveals a clear pattern: **50% Easy, 44% Medium, and only 6% Hard**. This distribution is critical for your preparation strategy.

It means the primary gatekeeper is not solving esoteric, complex algorithms, but rather demonstrating consistent, bug-free mastery of fundamentals. The goal is to reliably solve all Easy and most Medium problems. The Hard questions are rare but test your ability to handle more intricate logic, often built upon the core topics. Your study plan should reflect this: depth and accuracy on standard patterns will yield a higher return than chasing advanced topics.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a concentrated set of high-frequency topics. Prioritize these.

**Array (Top Topic)**
Manipulation, searching, and sorting within arrays are fundamental. Key patterns include sliding window, prefix sum, and in-place modifications.

**Hash Table**
The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. Used for frequency counting, deduplication, and complement searching (like in Two Sum).

**Two Pointers**
Essential for optimizing problems on sorted arrays or strings, such as finding pairs, removing duplicates, or checking palindromes.

**String**
Operations like reversal, parsing, and substring validation are common. Often combined with hash tables or two pointers.

**Math**
Problems involving basic number properties, modular arithmetic, or simulation of mathematical processes.

For Capgemini, a quintessential pattern combining **Array** and **Two Pointers** is finding a pair of numbers in a sorted array that sum to a target. This demonstrates efficient traversal and logical reasoning.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1}; // 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation Building**
Dedicate this phase to the top five topics: Array, Hash Table, Two Pointers, String, and Math. For each topic, learn the core theory and solve 10-15 curated problems, starting with Easy and progressing to Medium. Ensure you can implement standard patterns like the two-pointer sum above without hesitation.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration and Speed**
Shift to solving mixed Medium-difficulty problems that combine topics, such as a string parsing problem using a hash table. Use platforms that time your sessions. Participate in mock interviews to simulate pressure. Begin reviewing your code for edge cases and clean readability.

**Weeks 5-6: Assessment Simulation and Gap Closure**
Take full-length practice tests that mimic Capgemini's online assessment format. Identify any lingering weak spots—perhaps a specific math pattern or a tricky array traversal—and drill them intensely. Re-solve earlier problems to ensure recall and fluency.

## Key Tips

1.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** Given the high percentage of Easy/Medium questions, a correct, well-explained O(n²) solution is often better than a buggy O(n) one. Write clear, working code first.
2.  **Master In-Language Data Structures.** Know the exact syntax for initializing a hash map, sorting an array, or manipulating a string in your chosen interview language. This prevents fumbling during implementation.
3.  **Verbally Articulate Your Logic.** Before you write code, state your approach aloud. This aligns with interview expectations and helps you catch flawed logic early. Practice explaining the two-pointer example step-by-step.
4.  **Test with Edge Cases Explicitly.** After writing your solution, don't just run the given example. Verbally test with empty input, single-element arrays, large values, and negative numbers. This demonstrates thoroughness.

Success in Capgemini's coding interviews hinges on systematic preparation focused on high-probability topics and consistent execution. Build your foundation, practice under constraints, and communicate clearly.
