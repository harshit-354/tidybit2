When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. Oracle and Epam Systems represent two distinct profiles: a tech giant with a vast, challenging question bank and a global engineering services firm with a more concentrated, moderate set of problems. A direct comparison of their question patterns reveals clear strategic priorities for your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The difference in scale is the most immediate factor. Oracle's list of approximately 340 questions dwarfs Epam's 51. This volume indicates a broader and deeper expected knowledge base for Oracle candidates.

The difficulty distribution further clarifies their expectations. Oracle's breakdown (Easy: 70, Medium: 205, Hard: 65) shows a heavy emphasis on **Medium and Hard problems**. Over 79% of their questions fall into these categories, signaling that interviews are designed to rigorously test problem-solving, optimization, and handling edge cases. Success here requires mastery beyond fundamentals.

In contrast, Epam's distribution (Easy: 19, Medium: 30, Hard: 2) is overwhelmingly centered on **Easy and Medium problems**. With nearly 96% of questions at these levels and only a minimal Hard presence, the focus is on assessing solid competency in core data structures, clean implementation, and logical reasoning, rather than solving esoteric optimization challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures, creating significant overlap you can leverage.

- **Common Core:** **Array** and **String** manipulation are central to both. **Hash Table** usage for efficient lookups and frequency counting is also a key shared topic. Problems in these areas form the bedrock of preparation for either company.
- **Oracle's Depth:** Oracle adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a primary topic. This is a classic differentiator for higher-difficulty interviews, requiring practice in pattern recognition (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence) and state transition.
- **Epam's Focus:** Epam highlights **Two Pointers** as a core topic. This efficient technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists (like finding pairs or removing duplicates) is a staple of medium-difficulty interviews and emphasizes algorithmic thinking.

A typical overlapping question might involve finding a pair in an array that sums to a target. The optimal solution uses a Hash Table, but a Two Pointers approach works on a sorted array.

```python
# Hash Table solution (common optimal approach)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Two Pointers solution (if array is sorted)
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Hash Table solution
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Two Pointers solution (if array is sorted)
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left, right];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Hash Table solution
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[] {};
}

// Two Pointers solution (if array is sorted)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[] {left, right};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[] {};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

The strategic choice depends on your timeline and target.

**Prepare for Epam Systems first if:** You are early in your interview preparation cycle or are prioritizing confidence-building. Mastering their core list of ~51 questions, especially Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, and Hash Tables, will efficiently build a strong foundation. The lower proportion of Hard problems makes this a more manageable first milestone.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You are aiming for top-tier tech roles or have a longer runway. Conquering Oracle's question bank is the more comprehensive challenge. Success here requires tackling a high volume of Medium and Hard problems, including Dynamic Programming. If you can perform well on Oracle's pattern, you will likely find Epam's focused set less daunting. The depth required for Oracle naturally covers the breadth needed for Epam.

In summary, use Epam's list to solidify your core skills efficiently. Use Oracle's list to stress-test and deepen your algorithmic mastery. The shared focus on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables means preparation for one directly benefits the other.
