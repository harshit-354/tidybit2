When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what each organization prioritizes. TikTok and PayPal, while both major tech firms, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. Understanding these differences helps you allocate your preparation time strategically.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of their question banks. TikTok's list of 383 questions is over 3.5 times larger than PayPal's 106. This volume indicates a broader range of potential problems and a more extensive historical dataset for candidates to study.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their different approaches:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The interview process is heavily weighted toward **Medium** difficulty questions, which constitute about 68% of their catalog. The significant number of Hard questions (81, or ~21%) suggests that advancing in their process often requires solving complex, multi-step problems. The emphasis is on depth and algorithmic optimization.
- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The process is also centered on **Medium** questions (about 65%), but the overall count is much lower. The proportion of Hard questions is similar (~18%), but the absolute number (19 vs. 81) means you're less likely to encounter an extremely difficult problem. The focus leans more toward assessing strong foundational competency.

**Key Takeaway:** Preparing for TikTok requires grinding a larger set of problems, with special attention to challenging Medium and Hard scenarios. PayPal preparation can be more focused on mastering core patterns through a smaller, though still rigorous, question set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems dominate their question lists. This is the critical common ground for your preparation.

- **Shared Focus:** Expect questions involving two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, substring searches, and hash map-based lookups or frequency counting at both companies.

  ```python
  # Example: A common two-pointer problem (Valid Palindrome)
  def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
      l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
      while l < r:
          while l < r and not s[l].isalnum():
              l += 1
          while r > l and not s[r].isalnum():
              r -= 1
          if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
              return False
          l, r = l + 1, r - 1
      return True
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Example: A common two-pointer problem (Valid Palindrome)
  function isPalindrome(s) {
    let l = 0,
      r = s.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
      while (l < r && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[l])) l++;
      while (r > l && !/^[a-z0-9]$/i.test(s[r])) r--;
      if (s[l].toLowerCase() !== s[r].toLowerCase()) return false;
      l++;
      r--;
    }
    return true;
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Example: A common two-pointer problem (Valid Palindrome)
  public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
      int l = 0, r = s.length() - 1;
      while (l < r) {
          while (l < r && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(l))) l++;
          while (r > l && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(r))) r--;
          if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(l)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(r))) {
              return false;
          }
          l++; r--;
      }
      return true;
  }
  ```

- **Key Divergence:** The most notable difference is **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. DP is a major topic for TikTok but is absent from PayPal's listed top topics. TikTok's 81 Hard questions likely include many DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, unique paths). Conversely, PayPal explicitly lists **Sorting** as a core topic, indicating a focus on algorithms involving efficient ordering and search (e.g., merge intervals, top K elements).

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **PayPal**. Its smaller, more concentrated question list centered on Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, and Sorting allows you to build and solidify the essential algorithmic foundation efficiently. Mastering these will make you well-prepared for a significant portion of PayPal's interview and a large chunk of TikTok's easier and medium questions.

Once comfortable, pivot to **TikTok** preparation. This involves two key steps:

1.  **Expanding Volume:** Practice a wider variety of problems to cover their extensive list.
2.  **Adding Depth:** Dedicate significant time to **Dynamic Programming**. This topic requires separate, focused study to recognize patterns and construct state transitions.

    ```python
    # Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
    def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[n]
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
    function climbStairs(n) {
      if (n <= 2) return n;
      let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
      dp[1] = 1;
      dp[2] = 2;
      for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
      }
      return dp[n];
    }
    ```

    ```java
    // Example: A classic DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
    ```

In short, use PayPal's list to build your core skills, then use TikTok's list to test your limits on volume and advanced topics like DP.
