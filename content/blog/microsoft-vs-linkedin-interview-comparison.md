When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your efficiency. Microsoft and LinkedIn, while part of the same corporate family, present distinct interview landscapes. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear differences in volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics, which should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question pools. Microsoft's repository is vast, with **1,352 questions** cataloged. This volume reflects the company's broad range of products and engineering roles, from operating systems and cloud services to gaming and productivity software. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium-level questions (M762), with a significant number of easy (E379) and a smaller but substantial set of hard (H211) problems. This spread suggests that while a strong grasp of fundamentals is essential, candidates must be thoroughly prepared to tackle complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges.

In contrast, LinkedIn's question bank is much more focused, containing **180 questions**. This smaller, curated set likely aligns with LinkedIn's more specific domain: a large-scale professional social network and SaaS platform. The difficulty distribution follows a similar pattern but on a smaller scale: mostly medium (M117), with fewer easy (E26) and hard (H37) problems. The smaller pool does not imply easier interviews; it indicates that questions may be more targeted towards the company's specific technical stack and data-intensive, graph-related problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize foundational data structures, with **Array, String, and Hash Table** appearing as top topics. This overlap is universal in software engineering interviews and should form the bedrock of your preparation.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common Hash Table problem (Two Sum)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The key divergence is in the fourth-ranked topic. Microsoft strongly emphasizes **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a critical area for optimizing complex algorithms, which is prevalent in systems and performance-critical software. LinkedIn's list highlights **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. This aligns perfectly with LinkedIn's core product, which is built upon a massive graph of professional connections and interactions.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: DFS on a graph (adjacency list)
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

```javascript
// Example: DFS on a graph (adjacency list)
function dfs(graph, node, visited = new Set()) {
  if (!visited.has(node)) {
    visited.add(node);
    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
    }
  }
}
```

```java
// Example: DFS on a graph (adjacency list)
public void dfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int node, Set<Integer> visited) {
    if (!visited.contains(node)) {
        visited.add(node);
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by your interview timeline and the role's domain. **Start with Microsoft's question list if you have more time or are interviewing for a systems, backend, or generalist role.** Its breadth will force you to build comprehensive skills, particularly in Dynamic Programming, which is a high-value topic across many companies. Mastering this larger set will inherently cover most of LinkedIn's foundational topics (Array, String, Hash Table).

**Focus on LinkedIn's list if your interview is imminent or the role is specifically related to the social graph, data networks, or machine learning.** Dive deep into graph algorithms, especially DFS and its applications, while ensuring mastery of the core data structures. The focused nature of this list allows for more targeted, in-depth practice on problems relevant to their engineering challenges.

Ultimately, a strong candidate will be proficient in the overlapping core topics. Prioritize those, then branch out based on the company's specific technical emphasis: DP for Microsoft's optimization problems, and DFS/graph theory for LinkedIn's network-centric challenges.
