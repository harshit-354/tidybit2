Roku’s coding interview process is designed to assess practical problem-solving skills relevant to building and scaling their streaming platforms and devices. Candidates can expect a mix of algorithmic questions, system design discussions, and behavioral interviews. The coding portion typically involves 1-2 rounds of live coding, focusing on clean, efficient implementations of common data structure problems.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of 17 recent Roku coding questions reveals a clear emphasis on medium-difficulty problems. The breakdown is:

- **Easy:** 3 questions (18%)
- **Medium:** 10 questions (59%)
- **Hard:** 4 questions (24%)

This distribution signals that Roku’s primary filter is your ability to reliably solve standard algorithmic challenges under pressure. The high percentage of Medium problems means you must be proficient with core data structures and common patterns. The presence of Hard questions (nearly a quarter) indicates they are willing to probe depth for certain roles or in later interview stages. Your goal is to master Medium problems to pass the initial screens, then tackle a selection of Hard problems to demonstrate higher-tier competency.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Stack, Hash Table, and Simulation. Here’s how to prioritize them.

- **Array & String:** The foundation. Expect manipulations, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques.
- **Stack:** Critical for parsing, validation (e.g., parentheses), and monotonic stack problems for next-greater-element patterns.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to for O(1) lookups, frequency counting, and optimizing solutions from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Simulation:** Tests your ability to translate complex instructions into clean, bug-free code—a direct measure of implementation skill.

The most important pattern to master is the **Monotonic Stack**, frequently used for array problems involving finding the next greater or smaller element. Here is a classic example: finding the next greater element for each item in an array.

```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []  # monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for i in range(n * 2):  # Handle circular array by iterating twice
        idx = i % n
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[idx]:
            prev_idx = stack.pop()
            result[prev_idx] = nums[idx]
        if i < n:  # Only push indices from the first pass
            stack.append(idx)
    return result

# Example: [4, 2, 1, 5] -> [5, 5, 5, -1]
```

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(-1);
  const stack = []; // monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
    // Iterate twice for circular array
    const idx = i % n;
    while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < nums[idx]) {
      const prevIdx = stack.pop();
      result[prevIdx] = nums[idx];
    }
    if (i < n) {
      // Only push indices from the first pass
      stack.push(idx);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// Example: [4, 2, 1, 5] -> [5, 5, 5, -1]
```

```java
public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // monotonic decreasing stack (stores indices)

    for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) { // Iterate twice for circular array
        int idx = i % n;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[idx]) {
            int prevIdx = stack.pop();
            result[prevIdx] = nums[idx];
        }
        if (i < n) { // Only push indices from the first pass
            stack.push(idx);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example: [4, 2, 1, 5] -> [5, 5, 5, -1]
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Follow this plan to build and reinforce the necessary skills.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**

- Days 1-7: Deeply study Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Solve 15-20 problems, focusing on two-pointers, sliding windows, and prefix sums.
- Days 8-14: Master Stacks, Queues, and basic Simulation problems. Implement monotonic stack patterns and practice parsing/state-tracking simulations.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery**

- Re-solve the core problems from Weeks 1-2 without reference. Time yourself.
- Tackle 25-30 Medium problems that combine topics (e.g., Array + Hash Table, String + Stack). Prioritize problems tagged with Roku's top topics.
- Begin incorporating 1-2 Hard problems per week to stretch your thinking.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews & Gap Analysis**

- Conduct at least 6-8 timed mock interviews (45-60 minutes each) simulating the Roku format. Use a platform with voice/video or practice with a peer.
- Analyze every mistake: Was it a logic flaw, edge case miss, or slow implementation? Systematically review weak patterns.
- In the final days, revisit all previously solved problems to ensure fluency.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize for Readability First, Then Speed.** Interviewers need to follow your logic. Write clear variable names, add concise comments for complex steps, and avoid overly clever one-liners. Refactor for efficiency as a second pass.
2.  **Verbally Simulate Before Coding.** For Simulation-type problems, explicitly walk through 2-3 small examples aloud. This uncovers edge cases and clarifies the algorithm's steps before you write a single line of code.
3.  **Practice Writing Code on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** You likely won't have full IDE auto-completion. Get comfortable writing syntactically correct code without constant syntax checking.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions Immediately.** Before solving, confirm input assumptions (e.g., "Can the array be empty?", "Is the string ASCII or Unicode?"). This demonstrates proactive thinking.
5.  **Test with Edge Cases Systematically.** After coding, run through small, large, empty, and negative scenarios. Verbally state the expected output for each. This is often as important as the solution itself.

Success in a Roku interview comes from consistent, deliberate practice on the right material. Focus on the high-probability topics, internalize the patterns, and simulate the interview environment until it feels routine.
