When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns can dramatically increase your efficiency. Zoho and Cisco, while both established tech giants, present distinct profiles in their coding interview landscapes. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, and core topics to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions. Zoho's tagged list on TidyBit contains **179 questions**, significantly larger than Cisco's **86 questions**. This suggests Zoho's interview process may draw from a broader pool of problems or that its question bank has been more extensively documented.

The difficulty distribution also reveals a strategic nuance:

- **Zoho (E62/M97/H20):** The majority of questions are Medium (97), with a substantial number of Easy (62) and a smaller set of Hard (20). This profile indicates a strong focus on core problem-solving skills, with a significant ramp-up to moderately complex challenges. The presence of Hard questions means you should be prepared for at least one deeply algorithmic problem.
- **Cisco (E22/M49/H15):** The distribution follows a similar pattern but is scaled down. Medium-difficulty questions again form the core (49), with fewer Easy (22) and Hard (15) problems. The emphasis remains on solid, intermediate-level coding proficiency.

In essence, Zoho's test is likely more extensive, while both companies center their evaluations around Medium-difficulty problem-solving.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structure manipulation. The high-priority topics are nearly identical:

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Hash Table**

This overlap is critical. Mastering these three areas—particularly techniques like traversal, slicing, hashing for lookups, and character/count manipulation—will serve as the absolute foundation for both interview processes.

The key differentiator lies in the next layer of topics:

- **Zoho** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This signals that Zoho interviews frequently include classic optimization problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, maximum subarray) or problems where recursion with memoization is essential. Preparing for Zoho necessitates a dedicated study of DP patterns.
- **Cisco** explicitly lists **Two Pointers**. This indicates a common focus on efficient array/string algorithms that use multiple indices, such as finding pairs with a sum, removing duplicates in-place, or validating palindromes. While DP may still appear, the listed topics suggest a stronger emphasis on in-place operations and clever iteration.

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (common for Cisco)
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    chars = list(s)
    while left < right:
        chars[left], chars[right] = chars[right], chars[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return ''.join(chars)

# Example: Dynamic Programming (common for Zoho)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (common for Cisco)
function reverseString(s) {
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  const chars = s.split("");
  while (left < right) {
    [chars[left], chars[right]] = [chars[right], chars[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return chars.join("");
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (common for Zoho)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (common for Cisco)
public String reverseString(String s) {
    char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
    int left = 0, right = chars.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = chars[left];
        chars[left] = chars[right];
        chars[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return new String(chars);
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (common for Zoho)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Drill problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables until you can solve common Medium-level problems confidently. This core preparation is 100% applicable to both companies.

If you have interviews with both, **prepare for Zoho first**. Its larger question bank and the inclusion of Dynamic Programming make it the broader test. Mastering the patterns for Zoho (which includes practicing Two Pointers problems as part of array/string manipulation) will inherently cover a vast majority of what Cisco tests. The reverse is not as true; focusing only on Cisco's list might leave you under-prepared for Zoho's DP questions.

Ultimately, your priority should align with your interview schedule. Build a robust foundation, then specialize based on the company-specific emphasis: DP for Zoho, and refined in-place algorithms for Cisco.
