Fourkites, a leading supply chain visibility platform, uses coding interviews to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills and technical fundamentals. The process typically involves one or two rounds of algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a live collaborative editor. The focus is on clean, efficient code and logical reasoning under time constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Fourkites' coding interview questions break down as follows: **Easy (33%), Medium (67%), Hard (0%)**. This distribution is highly revealing. The complete absence of "Hard" problems indicates the company prioritizes **consistent, bug-free execution** over solving esoteric, complex algorithms. The two-thirds majority of "Medium" difficulty questions means you must be proficient in applying core data structures and algorithms to non-trivial, realistic problems. You won't need to derive novel algorithms on the fly, but you must demonstrate mastery of standard patterns. The "Easy" question serves as a warm-up or a check for basic coding competency. The takeaway: depth in foundational topics is more valuable than breadth in advanced ones.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, and Brainteaser. Here’s how to approach each.

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock. Expect problems involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and hash maps for frequency counting. Master in-place array manipulations and string builders.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A key topic for "Medium" problems. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Start with classic 1D and 2D DP patterns like Fibonacci, knapsack, or longest common subsequence.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Appears in puzzles and optimization problems. Be comfortable with core operations: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), left/right shifts (`<<`, `>>`), and checking/setting bits using masks.
- **Brainteaser:** These test logical deduction and out-of-the-box thinking. Practice is key. They often involve simple math, probability, or clever insights rather than complex code.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is paramount for Array and String problems at Fourkites. It's the optimal solution for a wide range of "Medium" questions involving subarrays or substrings. Here is a template for finding the longest substring with at most K distinct characters:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Expand window: add char at 'right'
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # Shrink window if we exceed k distinct chars
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # Update answer
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k) {
  const charCount = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // Expand window
    charCount.set(s[right], (charCount.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    // Shrink window if needed
    while (charCount.size > k) {
      charCount.set(s[left], charCount.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (charCount.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        charCount.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    // Update answer
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int longestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // Expand window
        char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
        charCount.put(rightChar, charCount.getOrDefault(rightChar, 0) + 1);

        // Shrink window if needed
        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            charCount.put(leftChar, charCount.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (charCount.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                charCount.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Update answer
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than cramming.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this time to Arrays, Strings, and Hash Maps. Solve 20-30 "Easy" problems to build speed and accuracy. Then, move to core "Medium" patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, and basic binary search.
- **Weeks 3-4: Core Medium Topics.** Tackle Dynamic Programming and Bit Manipulation. For DP, start with memoization, then tabulation. Solve 1-2 DP problems daily (e.g., climb stairs, coin change, longest increasing subsequence). For bit manipulation, practice common tricks like detecting powers of two or counting set bits.
- **Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Solve mixed-topic "Medium" problems under timed conditions (45-60 minutes). Simulate the actual interview: state assumptions, explain your approach, write clean code, and test with edge cases. Dedicate time to brainteasers—practice explaining your reasoning step-by-step.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Before writing code, verbally outline your approach, time/space complexity, and trade-offs. Ask clarifying questions. This is as important as the solution itself.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** Given the difficulty breakdown, a complete, correct, and readable O(n²) solution is often better than a buggy or incomprehensible O(n) one. Get a working solution first, then optimize if time permits.
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Always run through examples, including empty inputs, single-element arrays, large values, and negative numbers. State these cases aloud as you test.
4.  **Know Your Language's Standard Library.** Be fluent in the utilities for your chosen language (e.g., Python's `collections.defaultdict`, Java's `StringBuilder`, JavaScript's `Map` and `Set`) to avoid reinventing the wheel.

Success in Fourkites interviews comes from methodical preparation on their core topics and demonstrating clear, structured problem-solving. Practice the patterns, internalize the templates, and focus on clear communication.
