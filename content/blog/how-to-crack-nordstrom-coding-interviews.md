Nordstrom’s technical interview process for software engineering roles is designed to assess practical problem-solving and coding skills. Candidates can expect a mix of algorithmic questions, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a virtual whiteboard setting, followed by deeper system design or behavioral discussions. The focus is on clean, efficient code and logical reasoning under typical interview constraints.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

An analysis of recent Nordstrom coding questions reveals a clear pattern: out of 9 questions, 1 is Easy (11%), 7 are Medium (78%), and 1 is Hard (11%). This distribution is critical for your preparation strategy. It signals that Nordstrom heavily emphasizes **Medium-difficulty problems**—the core of algorithmic interviews. These questions test your ability to apply standard data structures and algorithms to slightly novel scenarios. The single Hard question likely serves as a differentiator for top-tier candidates, while the Easy question is a warm-up or filter. Your primary goal should be mastering Medium problems across key topics. Success here demonstrates the consistent, reliable problem-solving ability Nordstrom seeks.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming, and Math. You should prioritize these areas.

- **Array & String:** These are the fundamental data structures for most problems. Expect manipulations, searches, and transformations. A key pattern is the **Sliding Window** for subarray/substring problems.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to tool for O(1) lookups to reduce time complexity. It's essential for frequency counting, memoization, and matching problems.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A major topic for Medium/Hard questions. Focus on identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in scenarios like "maximum/minimum" or "number of ways."
- **Math:** Often involves number theory, modular arithmetic, or clever computations. Practice recognizing mathematical properties to avoid brute-force solutions.

The Sliding Window pattern is a quintessential Array/String technique. Here’s how to implement a fixed-size window to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    if len(arr) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSumSubarray(arr, k) {
  if (arr.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k) {
    if (arr.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable. Here is a focused plan.

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate this phase to core data structures (Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Sets) and essential algorithms (Sorting, Binary Search, Sliding Window). Solve 2-3 Easy/Medium problems daily on these topics to build muscle memory.
- **Weeks 3-4: Core Topics & Patterns.** Intensively study Nordstrom's top topics: Dynamic Programming, and advanced applications of Arrays/Strings with Hash Tables. Learn key patterns: Prefix Sum, Two Pointers, and DFS/BFS for graph-related problems. Target 2-3 Medium problems daily, ensuring at least one is DP or a complex array manipulation.
- **Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Shift to solving complete, timed Medium problems without topic hints. Use platforms that mimic the interview environment. In the final week, conduct 2-3 mock interviews with a peer or mentor, focusing on clarity, edge cases, and communicating your thought process aloud—just as you will in the real interview.

## Key Tips

1.  **Master the Medium.** Since 78% of questions are Medium, your fluency here determines success. Depth on core patterns is more valuable than superficially covering many topics.
2.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Narrate your thought process from problem understanding, through brute-force consideration, to optimized solution. This demonstrates structured thinking, even if you need a hint.
3.  **Prioritize Clean, Correct Code Over Premature Optimization.** Write readable code with clear variable names. Get a working solution, then optimize. A bug-free, well-explained solution is better than an optimal one filled with errors.
4.  **Don't Neglect the Fundamentals.** The single Easy question is free points. The single Hard question is a challenge. Solid fundamentals ensure you secure the Easy and have a fighting chance on the Hard, while dominating the Mediums.

Consistent, topic-focused practice is the most reliable path to passing Nordstrom's technical screen. Start with the patterns shown here, build your plan, and execute.
