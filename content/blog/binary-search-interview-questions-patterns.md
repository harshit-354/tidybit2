Binary search is more than just finding an element in a sorted array. It's a fundamental algorithmic pattern for efficiently searching in a _sorted space of possible answers_, making it a favorite in technical interviews for its elegance and logarithmic time complexity. With 258 tagged questions on our platform, it's a concept you cannot afford to overlook.

## Common Patterns

Recognizing these patterns transforms binary search from a memorized algorithm into a flexible problem-solving tool.

### 1. Classic Search in a Sorted Array

This is the foundational template. The key is maintaining the loop invariant and deciding how to update the boundaries.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Avoids overflow
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

</div>

### 2. Searching in a Rotated or Partially Sorted Array

Here, one half of the array is always sorted. Your logic must determine which half the target lies in.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def search_rotated(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # Left half is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # Right half is sorted
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

```javascript
function searchRotated(nums, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = nums.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
    if (nums[mid] === target) return mid;
    // Left half is sorted
    if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
      if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
        right = mid - 1;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
      // Right half is sorted
    } else {
      if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```java
public int searchRotated(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        // Left half is sorted
        if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        // Right half is sorted
        } else {
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

</div>

### 3. Binary Search on Answer (Min/Max Optimization)

This powerful pattern applies when you're asked to find the _minimum_ or _maximum_ value satisfying a condition. You perform binary search on the range of possible answers, using a helper function to test feasibility.

**Example Problem:** "Find the minimum capacity of a ship to ship all packages within D days." You binary search on possible capacities, using a helper to check if a given capacity works.

## Difficulty Breakdown

Our data shows 258 questions categorized as Easy (26, 10%), Medium (141, 55%), and Hard (91, 35%). This split is revealing.

- **Easy (10%):** These test your understanding of the core template and basic modifications, like finding boundaries or a pivot.
- **Medium (55%):** This is the sweet spot for interviews. You must apply binary search to non-obvious scenarios, such as rotated arrays, 2D matrices, or using the "search on answer" pattern. Most interview questions fall here.
- **Hard (35%):** These combine binary search with other complex concepts, like data structures (heaps, trees) or advanced greedy algorithms. They test deep pattern recognition and implementation under pressure.

The high percentage of Medium and Hard questions means interviewers use binary search to differentiate candidates. Solving the classic template is just the starting point.

## Which Companies Ask Binary Search

Binary search is a staple across top tech companies, reflecting its importance in designing efficient systems.

- [Google](/company/google) frequently asks questions involving search in rotated arrays or complex optimization.
- [Amazon](/company/amazon) and [Microsoft](/company/microsoft) often use it in problems related to scalability and resource allocation (classic "search on answer" scenarios).
- [Meta](/company/meta) incorporates it into problems involving sorted user data or feed algorithms.
- [Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg) uses it in financial data contexts, like finding specific time-series data points.

## Study Tips

1.  **Internalize the Template, Not Memorize It.** Understand why the loop condition is `left <= right` and why we use `mid + 1` and `mid - 1`. This prevents infinite loops and off-by-one errors.
2.  **Practice the "Search on Answer" Pattern.** This is the most common trick. If a problem asks for a minimum or maximum value, and you can write a function `feasible(x)` to test a candidate, you can likely use binary search.
3.  **Draw It Out.** For tricky problems, especially with rotations or unknown pivots, sketch the array and trace your `left`, `mid`, and `right` pointers. Visualizing the sorted halves is crucial.
4.  **Mix Difficulties.** Start with Easy problems to cement the template, then focus heavily on Medium problems—this is where you'll spend most of your interview time. Attempt Hards to stretch your application of the pattern.

Master these patterns and strategies, and you'll be able to efficiently navigate one of the most common and challenging topics in coding interviews.
