When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. LinkedIn and Samsung, while both testing core computer science fundamentals, present distinct profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. This comparison breaks down their patterns to help you tailor your study plan.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of questions in their known pools. LinkedIn's list is significantly larger at **180 questions**, compared to Samsung's **69 questions**. This volume suggests that for LinkedIn, you are more likely to encounter a problem you have not seen before, testing your ability to apply concepts to novel situations. For Samsung, the smaller pool means a higher chance of encountering a familiar problem, but mastery of those specific problems is more critical.

The difficulty distribution also offers a strategic clue:

- **LinkedIn (E26/M117/H37):** Medium difficulty questions are the overwhelming majority, comprising about **65%** of their list. This indicates that a strong, consistent performance on medium-level problems is the key to passing. The hard questions exist, but they are less frequent.
- **Samsung (E15/M37/H17):** The distribution is more balanced relative to its size, with Medium questions making up about **54%**. While still the focus, the proportion of Hard questions is slightly higher than at LinkedIn. This suggests that Samsung may place a greater emphasis on solving one or two complex problems correctly.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array** and **Hash Table** fundamentals. These are essential data structures for both roles, and you must be proficient.

Their divergences reveal their engineering priorities:

- **LinkedIn's Key Topics:** **String** manipulation and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** are prominent. DFS is critical for navigating social graphs, trees, and complex nested structures—a direct reflection of LinkedIn's network-based products. String problems often relate to text processing and data validation.
- **Samsung's Key Topics:** **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Two Pointers** are standout areas. DP is crucial for optimization problems common in systems, low-level software, and algorithm-heavy roles. The Two Pointer technique is frequently used in array/list manipulation and is a staple for writing efficient, in-place algorithms, which is valuable in embedded and performance-sensitive environments.

Here is a classic problem approached with techniques favored by each company:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# LinkedIn-style: DFS on a graph (Number of Islands)
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    count = 0
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= len(grid) or c >= len(grid[0]) or grid[r][c] != '1':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark as visited
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r, c+1)
        dfs(r, c-1)

    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == '1':
                dfs(i, j)
                count += 1
    return count
```

```javascript
// Samsung-style: Two Pointers (Container With Most Water)
function maxArea(height) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let maxArea = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    const width = right - left;
    const minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, width * minHeight);

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return maxArea;
}
```

```java
// Samsung-style: Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack)
public int knapsack(int[] values, int[] weights, int capacity) {
    int n = values.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i-1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]] + values[i-1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your timeline and strengths.

1.  **Prepare for Samsung first if** your interview is sooner or you want to build confidence with a more contained set of problems. Mastering their list of 69 questions, with special attention to Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers, is a concrete, achievable goal. It provides a solid foundation in algorithm optimization.
2.  **Prepare for LinkedIn first if** you have more time or are already strong in graph traversal. The larger question bank demands broader exposure. Use it to build stamina and adaptability with a wide variety of medium-difficulty problems, particularly DFS and string manipulation. This preparation will inherently cover the Array and Hash Table fundamentals needed for Samsung as well.

Ultimately, a strong candidate will be comfortable with all the core topics. The strategic difference lies in where you place your deepest, most company-specific practice.
