Compass (now part of Anywhere Real Estate) is known for a rigorous, standard technical interview process focused on core data structures and algorithms. The on-site loop typically involves multiple coding rounds where you'll solve problems on a whiteboard or in a shared editor, assessing both your problem-solving approach and coding fluency. Success hinges on systematic preparation aligned with their specific question patterns.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, the difficulty distribution for Compass coding interviews is approximately:

- **Easy:** 2 questions (25%)
- **Medium:** 5 questions (63%)
- **Hard:** 1 question (13%)

This breakdown is critical for planning. The high concentration of Medium-difficulty questions means your primary goal is to achieve consistent, bug-free execution on problems involving combinations of core concepts (e.g., arrays and hash tables). The single Hard question is often a complex iteration on a fundamental pattern, not an obscure algorithm. Therefore, depth on common topics is more valuable than breadth across rare ones. You must solve Medium problems efficiently to have the mental bandwidth required for the Hard problem.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are String, Array, String Matching, Hash Table, and Sorting. You should master their intersections.

- **String & Array:** These are the fundamental data structures for most problems. Focus on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and in-place transformations.
- **String Matching:** Often tested through problems like checking for substrings, anagrams, or palindromes. The core pattern is often optimized using a hash table or a pre-processed array (like a character count array).
- **Hash Table:** The universal tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize brute-force solutions. It's frequently combined with arrays or strings to track counts, indices, or seen elements.
- **Sorting:** While sometimes the explicit goal, sorting is more often a crucial preprocessing step that enables efficient two-pointer or greedy solutions.

The most important combined pattern is likely the **Hash Table for Character/Element Counting**, frequently used in string and array problems. Here is a classic example: determining if two strings are anagrams.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    char_count = {}
    for ch in s:
        char_count[ch] = char_count.get(ch, 0) + 1
    for ch in t:
        if ch not in char_count or char_count[ch] == 0:
            return False
        char_count[ch] -= 1
    return True
```

```javascript
function isAnagram(s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

  const charCount = new Map();
  for (const ch of s) {
    charCount.set(ch, (charCount.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
  }
  for (const ch of t) {
    if (!charCount.has(ch) || charCount.get(ch) === 0) return false;
    charCount.set(ch, charCount.get(ch) - 1);
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

    int[] charCount = new int[26]; // For lowercase English letters
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        charCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        charCount[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
    }
    for (int count : charCount) {
        if (count != 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, topic-driven plan is essential.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Dedicate each day to one of the top five topics. For each topic, study the core patterns (e.g., for Arrays: two-pointer, sliding window, prefix sum). Solve 2-3 Easy and 3-4 Medium problems per pattern. Implement every solution in your primary language.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Practice.** Focus on problems that combine two top topics, like "Group Anagrams" (String + Hash Table + Sorting) or "Two Sum" (Array + Hash Table). Aim for 4-5 Medium problems daily. Begin timed practice sessions (45 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.

**Week 5: Mock Interviews and Gaps.** Conduct at least 3-5 mock interviews with a peer or using a platform. Each session should include a Medium problem and a Hard problem. Identify weak spots (e.g., dynamic programming within arrays, complex string matching) and dedicate a day to review each.

**Week 6: Final Review and Company-Specific Prep.** Re-solve the most frequent Compass questions. Practice articulating your thought process aloud while coding. Ensure you can derive and code optimal solutions for Medium problems within 25 minutes.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** State the brute-force solution and its complexity first, then explain your optimization path (e.g., "We can use a hash map here to trade space for time"). This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** For Medium problems, a clear, well-coded solution using a standard pattern is better than a buggy, "optimal" one. Write clean, modular code with meaningful variable names.
3.  **Test Your Own Code.** After writing your solution, walk through a small but non-trivial test case. Manually step through the logic to catch off-by-one errors or edge cases (empty input, single element). This is expected.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions.** Before starting, confirm assumptions about input format, size, and expected output. A question about character set (ASCII vs. Unicode) can change your approach to a string problem.

Mastery of these core topics and patterns, combined with disciplined practice, will position you strongly for the Compass interview loop.
