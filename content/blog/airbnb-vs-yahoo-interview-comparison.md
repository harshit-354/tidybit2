When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial. Both Airbnb and Yahoo have published 64 questions each, but their distributions and focuses differ significantly. This comparison breaks down their question volume, difficulty, topic overlap, and provides a strategic preparation order.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference lies in difficulty distribution. Airbnb's 64 questions are split into 11 Easy, 34 Medium, and 19 Hard problems. This indicates a strong emphasis on Medium and Hard challenges, suggesting their interviews are designed to test deep problem-solving and algorithmic mastery. You must be comfortable with complex scenarios and optimization.

In contrast, Yahoo's 64 questions consist of 26 Easy, 32 Medium, and only 6 Hard problems. This profile is considerably more accessible, with a heavy focus on foundational and intermediate concepts. The interview process likely prioritizes correctness, clean code, and understanding of core data structures over solving the most esoteric puzzles.

**Key Takeaway:** Airbnb's interview has a higher difficulty ceiling. Preparing for it will inherently cover the depth needed for Yahoo. Yahoo's set is an excellent starting point for building core competency.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **String** manipulations. These are foundational areas for any software engineering interview. Mastery here is non-negotiable for both.

The critical divergence is in the fourth most frequent topic. Airbnb lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, which aligns with its higher number of Hard questions. DP problems often represent a significant step up in complexity and require dedicated practice.

Yahoo's fourth topic is **Sorting**. While sorting algorithms are fundamental and sometimes appear in more complex problems, this focus suggests a greater emphasis on classical algorithms, data manipulation, and efficiency analysis rather than advanced DP patterns.

**Coding Examples: Core vs. Advanced**
A classic overlap question might involve a Hash Table. A Yahoo-style question could be checking for duplicates, while Airbnb might extend it to a more complex scenario.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Yahoo-style: Find a pair with a given sum using a hash set.
def two_sum_yahoo(nums, target):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False

# Airbnb-style: Often involves a follow-up or a DP twist.
# This is a different, more complex problem (DP: Coin Change).
def coin_change_airbnb(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Yahoo-style: Find a pair with a given sum.
function twoSumYahoo(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (const num of nums) {
    const complement = target - num;
    if (seen.has(complement)) return true;
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return false;
}

// Airbnb-style: Coin Change (DP).
function coinChangeAirbnb(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Yahoo-style: Find a pair with a given sum.
public boolean twoSumYahoo(int[] nums, int target) {
    Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        int complement = target - num;
        if (seen.contains(complement)) return true;
        seen.add(num);
    }
    return false;
}

// Airbnb-style: Coin Change (DP).
public int coinChangeAirbnb(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1); // Use a large value
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Yahoo first**. Its question set provides a broader base of Easy and Medium problems across the most common topics (Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting). This builds the essential speed, accuracy, and pattern recognition needed for any interview. Success here validates your core algorithmic skills.

Then, transition to **Airbnb**. Use its problem set to ramp up difficulty. The Medium problems will reinforce and deepen your knowledge, while the significant number of Hard problems and Dynamic Programming focus will push you into advanced territory. If you can comfortably solve a mix of Airbnb's Medium and Hard questions, you will be over-prepared for Yahoo's technical screen.

**Strategic Path:** Start with Yahoo's list to build confidence and cover fundamentals. Once solid, tackle Airbnb's list to develop the advanced problem-solving stamina and depth required for top-tier company interviews. This approach efficiently layers your skills from foundation to mastery.
