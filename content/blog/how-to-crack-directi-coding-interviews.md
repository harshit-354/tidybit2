## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Directi’s coding interviews are not for the faint of heart. The data shows a clear pattern: 0% Easy, 56% Medium, and 44% Hard questions. This distribution tells you everything about their hiring bar. They are not screening for basic competency; they are stress-testing for advanced problem-solving under pressure. The complete absence of Easy questions means you can skip introductory “warm-up” problems in your prep. Every minute of study should be dedicated to Medium and Hard-tier challenges. The high proportion of Hard problems (nearly half) indicates they expect candidates to not only implement complex algorithms but also optimize them and handle intricate edge cases. Your goal is to become so comfortable with Medium problems that they feel routine, leaving you the mental bandwidth to tackle the demanding Hard problems that will likely decide your offer.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a targeted study roadmap. Master these five areas first.

**Array:** The foundation for countless problems, often involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, or prefix/suffix computations. Expect questions that combine array traversal with other concepts like hashing or sorting.

**Dynamic Programming (DP):** A critical area given its difficulty and frequency. You must be able to identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, then move from a brute-force recursion to a memoized or tabulated solution. Pattern recognition for classic problems (knapsack, LCS, LIS) is essential.

**Tree:** Questions frequently involve Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs). Traversals (recursive and iterative), path sums, lowest common ancestors, and BST validation are common themes. You must be able to reason about tree properties recursively.

**Depth-First Search (DFS):** While often applied to trees, DFS is crucial for graph traversal, backtracking, and exploring all possibilities in state-space problems (like generating permutations or solving puzzles). Mastering recursive DFS and its iterative stack-based implementation is non-negotiable.

**Math:** Directi often includes clever number theory or combinatorial problems. Focus on prime numbers, modular arithmetic, greatest common divisor (GCD), and using properties to avoid brute-force computation.

### Code Example: A Key DP Pattern (0/1 Knapsack)

The 0/1 Knapsack pattern is fundamental. It teaches you how to build a DP table where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value achievable with the first `i` items and a weight limit `w`. This pattern extends to many other problems like subset sum or partition equal subset sum.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    # dp[i][w] = max value with first i items and capacity w
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                # Option 1: Take the item
                take = values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]
                # Option 2: Skip the item
                skip = dp[i-1][w]
                dp[i][w] = max(take, skip)
            else:
                # Cannot take the item
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Example usage
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: 9
```

```javascript
function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  const n = weights.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        const take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
        const skip = dp[i - 1][w];
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[n][capacity];
}

// Example usage
const weights = [1, 3, 4, 5];
const values = [1, 4, 5, 7];
const capacity = 7;
console.log(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
```

```java
public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    int take = values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]];
                    int skip = dp[i - 1][w];
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(take, skip);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;
        System.out.println(knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

Weeks 1-2: Foundation and Core Topics. Spend the first two weeks intensively studying the top five topics. For each topic, solve 15-20 curated Medium problems. Use a mix of learning resources: understand the theory, then immediately apply it by coding. Your goal is to internalize patterns like DFS traversal, DP state definition, and array two-pointer techniques. Do not just read solutions; code every problem from scratch.

Weeks 3-4: Advanced Patterns and Hard Problems. Dedicate this phase to Hard problems from the core topics. Start integrating topics—solve a DP problem on trees, or a DFS problem on a graph represented as an array. Practice explaining your thought process out loud as you solve. Simulate a 45-minute interview: 10 minutes for thinking and discussing approach, 25-30 minutes for coding, and 5 minutes for testing and edge cases.

Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Gap Analysis. In the final stretch, take at least 8-10 full mock interviews focusing on Medium-Hard problems. Use platforms that provide Directi-specific questions or similar difficulty problems. After each mock, ruthlessly analyze your gaps. Was it a knowledge gap (e.g., not knowing Kadane's algorithm)? A performance gap (e.g., buggy code under time pressure)? Or a communication gap? Target your remaining study time to close these specific gaps.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your DP State Immediately.** When a problem smells like Dynamic Programming, the first words out of your mouth should be: "I think we can use DP here. Let `dp[i]` represent..." Clearly defining your state and transition function before writing code shows structured thinking and makes the implementation phase trivial.
2.  **Validate Tree Input Assumptions.** Never assume the input is a perfect Binary Search Tree or even a valid tree. Ask: "Can the tree be null? Are there duplicate values? Is it guaranteed to be a BST?" State how your algorithm handles these cases (e.g., "My DFS will handle a null node by returning a base value").
3.  **Optimize Iteratively, But State the Brute-Force First.** Start with the simplest, most correct solution, even if it's O(n²). Then, analyze its bottlenecks and propose optimizations (e.g., "We are re-scanning this array repeatedly; we can use a hash map to reduce lookups to O(1)"). This demonstrates a methodical approach to optimization.
4.  **Practice Writing Flawless Code on Paper/Whiteboard.** Directi interviews may involve whiteboarding. Practice writing syntactically perfect code without an IDE. Pay attention to off-by-one errors in loops, correct recursive base cases, and proper class/method definitions in Java. Neat, runnable pseudocode is better than messy, buggy actual code.

Success in a Directi interview is a function of depth over breadth. Master the core topics, drill the hardest problems, and practice performing under interview conditions.
