When preparing for technical interviews at Zoho and NVIDIA, you need to understand their distinct engineering focuses and how that translates into their coding assessments. Zoho, a diversified business software company, emphasizes building robust, scalable applications. NVIDIA, a leader in accelerated computing and AI, focuses on high-performance, low-level systems and algorithm efficiency. This difference shapes their question banks, despite significant overlap in core topics.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Zoho's list of 179 questions is larger than NVIDIA's 137, suggesting a broader but potentially more application-oriented scope.

**Zoho's Distribution (E62/M97/H20):**

- **Easy (35%):** A substantial portion, often testing clean implementation of standard data structures and logic for business scenarios.
- **Medium (54%):** The core of their interview, focusing on optimizing algorithms for real-world constraints and system design fundamentals.
- **Hard (11%):** A smaller set, likely involving complex multi-step problems or advanced dynamic programming.

**NVIDIA's Distribution (E34/M89/H14):**

- **Easy (25%):** A smaller slice, often used as warm-ups or to test basic correctness in C/C++ contexts.
- **Medium (65%):** The dominant category, heavily focused on algorithmic optimization, memory management, and concurrency—key for systems and GPU programming.
- **Hard (10%):** Similar proportion to Zoho, but these problems likely delve into parallel algorithms, hardware-aware optimization, or complex graph traversals.

NVIDIA's higher concentration of Medium questions indicates a stronger emphasis on algorithmic proficiency and performance analysis.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems. These form the essential toolkit for any software engineer. The key difference lies in the fourth most frequent topic for each.

**Zoho's Key Topic: Dynamic Programming**
DP is crucial for Zoho because it's used to solve complex optimization problems common in business logic, resource allocation, and feature planning. Expect questions on knapsack variants, longest common subsequence, and pathfinding.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example Zoho-style DP: Count ways to reach a score (Coin Change variant)
def count_ways(scores, target):
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for score in scores:
        for i in range(score, target + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[i - score]
    return dp[target]
```

```javascript
// Example Zoho-style DP: Count ways to reach a score (Coin Change variant)
function countWays(scores, target) {
  const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (const score of scores) {
    for (let i = score; i <= target; i++) {
      dp[i] += dp[i - score];
    }
  }
  return dp[target];
}
```

```java
// Example Zoho-style DP: Count ways to reach a score (Coin Change variant)
public int countWays(int[] scores, int target) {
    int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int score : scores) {
        for (int i = score; i <= target; i++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - score];
        }
    }
    return dp[target];
}
```

**NVIDIA's Key Topic: Sorting**
For NVIDIA, deep knowledge of sorting algorithms—their time/space complexity, stability, and parallelizability—is critical. You might be asked to implement a custom comparator, optimize a sort for specific hardware, or use sorting as a key step in a larger systems problem (e.g., scheduling GPU kernels).

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example NVIDIA-style Sorting: Custom sort for hardware priorities
def schedule_kernels(kernels):
    # Sort by priority descending, then duration ascending
    kernels.sort(key=lambda x: (-x['priority'], x['duration']))
    return kernels
```

```javascript
// Example NVIDIA-style Sorting: Custom sort for hardware priorities
function scheduleKernels(kernels) {
  // Sort by priority descending, then duration ascending
  kernels.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.priority !== b.priority) {
      return b.priority - a.priority;
    }
    return a.duration - b.duration;
  });
  return kernels;
}
```

```java
// Example NVIDIA-style Sorting: Custom sort for hardware priorities
import java.util.*;

public List<Kernel> scheduleKernels(List<Kernel> kernels) {
    kernels.sort((a, b) -> {
        if (a.priority != b.priority) {
            return b.priority - a.priority;
        }
        return a.duration - b.duration;
    });
    return kernels;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Zoho first** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey. Its larger set of Easy and Medium problems on foundational topics provides a solid, broad base. Mastering Zoho's list will comfortably cover the Array, String, and Hash Table fundamentals needed for NVIDIA, while also building competency in Dynamic Programming—a universally valuable skill.

Switch to **NVIDIA-specific preparation** after you have a strong command of the shared core. Here, you must deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms and their trade-offs. Shift your mindset towards optimization, memory, and concurrency. Practice analyzing the time and space complexity of every solution with extreme rigor, as performance is paramount in NVIDIA's domain.

In summary, use Zoho's list to build a wide foundation, then use NVIDIA's list to sharpen that knowledge with a focus on performance and systems thinking.
