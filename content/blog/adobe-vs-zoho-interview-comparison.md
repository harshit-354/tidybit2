When preparing for technical interviews at major software companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas is crucial. Adobe and Zoho, while both established tech firms, present distinct profiles in their coding interview challenges based on their product domains and engineering needs. This comparison analyzes their question banks to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of documented questions and their difficulty distribution reveals the expected interview scope.

**Adobe** presents a larger question bank with **227 questions**, categorized as Easy (68), Medium (129), and Hard (30). The distribution shows a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, which are typical for assessing core problem-solving and implementation skills. The presence of 30 Hard questions indicates that senior or specialized roles may encounter complex algorithmic challenges requiring optimized solutions.

**Zoho** has a smaller but still substantial bank of **179 questions**, with a breakdown of Easy (62), Medium (97), and Hard (20). Similar to Adobe, the focus is squarely on Medium-difficulty problems, though the proportion is slightly lower. The reduced count of Hard questions suggests interviews might place a relatively stronger emphasis on foundational correctness and clarity over extreme optimization, though this can vary by team and role.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with a notable divergence in one key area.

**Common Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems form the backbone of interviews at both Adobe and Zoho. You must be proficient in manipulating these structures. Two-pointer techniques are frequently applied within these topics.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer for a common array problem (e.g., two-sum II)
def two_sum(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer for a common array problem (e.g., two-sum II)
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer for a common array problem (e.g., two-sum II)
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};
}
```

**Key Divergence:** Adobe explicitly lists **Two Pointers** as a top topic, emphasizing in-place array/string manipulation. Zoho lists **Dynamic Programming** as a core topic instead. This signals that Zoho interviews are more likely to include classic DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, DP on strings) to assess optimization and state management thinking.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: A classic DP problem relevant to Zoho (e.g., Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A classic DP problem relevant to Zoho (e.g., Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A classic DP problem relevant to Zoho (e.g., Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your interview timeline and the need to build a foundation.

If you are interviewing with **both companies**, start with the **common core**: Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables. Master operations, sorting, searching, and hashing techniques. Then, branch based on your first target. For **Adobe**, deeply practice two-pointer and sliding window patterns on array/string problems. For **Zoho**, dedicate significant time to Dynamic Programming, focusing on pattern recognition for top-down and bottom-up approaches.

If you are **choosing a company to apply to**, consider your strengths. If you excel at logical pointer manipulation and in-place algorithms, Adobe's profile may align better. If you are strong in recursive thinking, state definition, and optimization, Zoho's emphasis on DP could be a better fit.

Regardless, use the larger Adobe question bank for extensive Medium-difficulty practice, as it will build robust general skills. Then, tailor your final preparation using the specific Zoho DP or Adobe two-pointer focus areas.
