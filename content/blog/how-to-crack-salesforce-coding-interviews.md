Salesforce is consistently ranked among the best places to work in tech, and their interview bar reflects the caliber of engineers they want to hire. The company builds enterprise-scale cloud platforms — CRM, Marketing Cloud, MuleSoft, Tableau, Slack — and their coding interviews test whether you can think through problems that mirror the complexity of real distributed systems.

A typical Salesforce interview process includes a recruiter call, a technical phone screen with one or two coding problems, and a virtual or on-site loop of four to five rounds. The loop usually contains two coding rounds, one system design round (for senior roles), and one or two behavioral rounds. Salesforce places significant weight on cultural fit through their "Ohana" values, so expect the behavioral component to matter more than at some other companies.

## By the Numbers

Salesforce's question bank contains **189 questions**, with a difficulty profile that skews notably harder than average:

- **Easy: 27 questions (14%)** — A small fraction. Do not expect many warmup-level problems in the actual interview.
- **Medium: 113 questions (60%)** — The core of what you will face. Salesforce interviews live in the medium tier.
- **Hard: 49 questions (26%)** — Over a quarter of the pool. This is a higher hard-question ratio than most companies outside of FAANG.

The 14/60/26 split signals that Salesforce is not messing around. If you are only comfortable with Easy problems, you will struggle. You need to be solid on Mediums and comfortable attempting Hards.

## Top Topics to Focus On

**Array** — The most frequently tested category. Expect problems involving subarray computations, interval merging, matrix traversals, and in-place modifications. Salesforce array problems tend to have a twist that elevates them beyond textbook implementations. For example, you might be asked to find the maximum sum of a subarray with a specific constraint, or to rotate a matrix in-place with minimal extra space. Mastering two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and prefix sums is crucial for these problems.

**String** — Parsing, encoding/decoding, and string transformation problems are common. Given Salesforce's focus on data platforms, string problems sometimes involve structured data manipulation — think JSON-like parsing or query string handling. You should be comfortable with techniques like string building, character counting, and using regular expressions for validation. Problems often involve checking for palindromes, anagrams, or implementing basic string compression.

**Hash Table** — Essential for optimizing brute-force solutions. Many Salesforce problems have an O(n) hash-map solution hiding behind an O(n^2) naive approach. Practice recognizing when a hash map can eliminate a nested loop. Common patterns include using a hash map to store indices for fast lookups, counting frequencies of elements, or storing precomputed results (like in two-sum problems). Understanding the trade-offs between hash tables and other data structures like sets or arrays is key.

**Dynamic Programming** — This is where Salesforce separates strong candidates from average ones. With 26% of questions at Hard difficulty, DP appears regularly. Focus on subsequence problems, grid-based DP, and knapsack variants. You do not need to memorize solutions, but you must be able to identify the subproblem structure, define the state, and write the recurrence relation. Common starting points include the Fibonacci sequence, coin change, and longest increasing subsequence.

**Sorting** — Custom sorting, interval-based problems, and problems where sorting is a preprocessing step. Know when to use a priority queue versus a full sort, and be comfortable implementing comparator functions. Sorting is often the key to turning an O(n²) solution into an O(n log n) one. Be prepared to sort arrays of custom objects or to sort based on multiple criteria.

## Preparation Strategy

**Weeks 1-2: Establish Fundamentals**

Even though Easy problems are rare in Salesforce interviews, start here to build fluency. Spend the first week on Easy and low-Medium problems in arrays, strings, and hash tables. Solve 3 to 4 per day. In week two, begin introducing DP concepts — start with classic problems like climbing stairs, coin change, and longest common subsequence. Let's look at a fundamental example of a hash table problem: the Two Sum problem, which is a classic for testing the ability to use a hash map for O(n) time complexity.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type target: int
    :rtype: List[int]
    """
    num_map = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map(); // value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}
```

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>(); // value -> index
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { numMap.get(complement), i };
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {}; // No solution found
    }
}
```

</div>

**Weeks 3-4: Medium-Difficulty Depth**

This is the critical phase. Dedicate two full weeks to Medium problems, with a focus on arrays, hash tables, and dynamic programming. Aim for 2 to 3 problems per day under timed conditions (35 minutes per problem). When you encounter a DP problem, always write out the recurrence relation before coding. Practice sorting-based problems at least twice a week. A common medium-difficulty array problem is "Merge Intervals," which tests sorting and array manipulation skills.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def merge(intervals):
    """
    :type intervals: List[List[int]]
    :rtype: List[List[int]]
    """
    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort intervals by their start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

    return merged
```

```javascript
function merge(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return [];

  // Sort intervals by their start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    // If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
    // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      // Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return new int[0][];

        // Sort intervals by their start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply add it.
            if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.add(interval);
            } else {
                // Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
                merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] = Math.max(merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }
}
```

**Week 5: Hard Problems and System Design**

Tackle 10 to 12 Hard problems, prioritizing DP and array-based questions. For senior candidates, begin system design preparation — Salesforce may ask you to design a CRM notification system, a multi-tenant data pipeline, or a real-time analytics dashboard. Study how Salesforce's own platform handles multi-tenancy. A classic hard DP problem is the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" (LIS), which requires understanding optimal substructure.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def length_of_lis(nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # dp[i] will be the length of the LIS ending at index i
    dp = [1] * len(nums)

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)

# More optimal O(n log n) solution using patience sorting
def length_of_lis_optimal(nums):
    tails = []
    for num in nums:
        # Find the first index in tails where tails[i] >= num
        left, right = 0, len(tails)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if tails[mid] < num:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        if left == len(tails):
            tails.append(num)
        else:
            tails[left] = num
    return len(tails)
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

  // dp[i] will be the length of the LIS ending at index i
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return Math.max(...dp);
}

// More optimal O(n log n) solution using patience sorting
function lengthOfLISOptimal(nums) {
  const tails = [];
  for (const num of nums) {
    // Find the first index in tails where tails[i] >= num
    let left = 0,
      right = tails.length;
    while (left < right) {
      const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (tails[mid] < num) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid;
      }
    }
    if (left === tails.length) {
      tails.push(num);
    } else {
      tails[left] = num;
    }
  }
  return tails.length;
}
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;

        // dp[i] will be the length of the LIS ending at index i
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {

        }

        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int len : dp) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }

}

**Week 6: Mock Interviews and Polish**

Run three to four full mock interviews. Each should include one Medium and one Hard problem, with 45 minutes total. Practice articulating your approach before writing code — Salesforce interviewers value communication. Review your weakest DP patterns and redo problems you previously failed. During this phase, also practice writing clean, production-ready code with proper variable names and comments.

## Key Tips

1. **Take dynamic programming seriously.** With a quarter of questions at Hard difficulty, DP is not optional. If you have historically avoided DP, now is the time to confront it. Start with 1D DP, move to 2D, and practice identifying overlapping subproblems in unfamiliar settings. A good exercise is to solve the classic "Coin Change" problem, which demonstrates both the concept of optimal substructure and the difference between the number of ways and the minimum number of coins.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    """
    Minimum number of coins to make up amount.
    :type coins: List[int]
    :type amount: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    # dp[i] = min coins to make amount i
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  // dp[i] = min coins to make amount i
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[amount] !== Infinity ? dp[amount] : -1;
}
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        // dp[i] = min coins to make amount i
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1); // Use a value larger than any possible answer
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                if (i - coin >= 0) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}
```

</div>

2. **Communicate your approach before coding.** Salesforce interviewers explicitly evaluate how well you explain your thinking. Spend two to three minutes outlining your approach, discussing tradeoffs, and confirming the expected complexity before writing a single line of code. For example, when presented with a problem, start by restating the problem in your own words, then discuss brute-force solutions, followed by optimized approaches, and finally explain why your chosen solution is optimal.

3. **Understand Salesforce's business context.** Behavioral rounds at Salesforce are consequential. Research the company's values, its product ecosystem, and recent acquisitions. Be prepared to discuss how you collaborate, handle disagreements, and contribute to team culture. Prepare specific examples using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method that align with Salesforce's core values like Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, and Equality.

4. **Practice interval and sorting problems.** These appear more often at Salesforce than at many other companies. Merge intervals, insert interval, meeting rooms — know these patterns cold. Another common pattern is the "Meeting Rooms II" problem, which requires finding the minimum number of rooms needed to schedule all meetings. This tests your ability to use sorting and a priority queue (min-heap).

<div class="code-group">

```python
import heapq

def min_meeting_rooms(intervals):
    """
    :type intervals: List[List[int]]
    :rtype: int
    """
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Min-heap to store end times of meetings in progress
    heap = []
    heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[0][1])

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        # If the room due to free the earliest is free before this meeting starts, reuse it
        if heap[0] <= interval[0]:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
        # Assign a new room (or the reused one) for the current meeting
        heapq.heappush(heap, interval[1])

    return len(heap)
```

```javascript
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return 0;

  // Sort intervals by start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  // Min-heap to store end times of meetings in progress
  const heap = new MinHeap();
  heap.insert(intervals[0][1]);

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    // If the room due to free the earliest is free before this meeting starts, reuse it
    if (heap.peek() <= intervals[i][0]) {
      heap.extractMin();
    }
    // Assign a new room (or the reused one) for the current meeting
    heap.insert(intervals[i][1]);
  }

  return heap.size();
}

// Simple MinHeap implementation for demonstration
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(val) {
    this.heap.push(val);
    this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
  }

  extractMin() {
    const min = this.heap[0];
    const last = this.heap.pop();
    if (this.heap.length > 0) {
      this.heap[0] = last;
      this.sinkDown(0);
    }
    return min;
  }

  peek() {
    return this.heap[0];
  }

  size() {
    return this.heap.length;
  }

  bubbleUp(index) {
    while (index > 0) {
      const parent = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
      if (this.heap[parent] <= this.heap[index]) break;
      [this.heap[parent], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[parent]];
      index = parent;
    }
  }

  sinkDown(index) {
    const length = this.heap.length;
    while (true) {
      let left = 2 * index + 1;
      let right = 2 * index + 2;
      let swap = null;
      let element = this.heap[index];

      if (left < length && this.heap[left] < element) {
        swap = left;
      }
      if (right < length && this.heap[right] < (swap === null ? element : this.heap[left])) {
        swap = right;
      }
      if (swap === null) break;
      [this.heap[index], this.heap[swap]] = [this.heap[swap], this.heap[index]];
      index = swap;
    }
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;

        // Sort intervals by start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        // Min-heap to store end times of meetings in progress
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        heap.offer(intervals[0][1]);

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            // If the room due to free the earliest is free before this meeting starts, reuse it
            if (heap.peek() <= intervals[i][0]) {
                heap.poll();
            }
            // Assign a new room (or the reused one) for the current meeting
            heap.offer(intervals[i][1]);
        }

        return heap.size();
    }
}
```

</div>

5. **Do not neglect time complexity analysis.** Salesforce interviewers frequently ask you to analyze and justify your solution's complexity. Practice stating the Big-O of your approach and explaining why it is optimal or what the theoretical lower bound is. Be prepared to discuss both time and space complexity, and consider trade-offs between different approaches. For example, in the "Two Sum" problem, the hash table solution provides O(n) time complexity at the cost of O(n) space, while a brute-force approach would be O(n²) time and O(1) space.
