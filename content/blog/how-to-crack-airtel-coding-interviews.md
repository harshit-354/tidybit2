Airtel's coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving skills that reflect real-world engineering challenges. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds where you'll face algorithmic questions on a platform like HackerRank or CodeSignal, followed by a deeper dive into system design and behavioral discussions. While the difficulty isn't extreme, the emphasis is on clean, efficient, and well-explained solutions under time pressure.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent patterns, Airtel's coding questions are heavily weighted toward the medium difficulty tier. Approximately 86% of questions are medium, with the remaining 14% being easy. Notably, hard problems are virtually absent. This distribution is strategic: it tests your core competency in applying fundamental algorithms to non-trivial problems, not your ability to solve obscure puzzles. It means you must master translating common patterns—like those used for array manipulation or optimization—into bug-free code quickly. The absence of hard problems is an opportunity; depth in standard medium-level patterns will give you a significant advantage.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data shows a clear set of recurring themes. Prioritize these areas in your preparation.

**Array:** The most frequent topic. Expect problems involving transformations, subarray calculations, or in-place modifications. Master techniques for traversing and updating arrays efficiently.
**Prefix Sum:** A powerful technique for optimizing range sum queries or subarray problems. It turns O(n²) brute-force solutions into O(n) or O(n log n) solutions by precomputing cumulative sums.
**Greedy:** Often appears in optimization problems (e.g., minimum operations, scheduling). The key is to identify the locally optimal choice that leads to a globally optimal solution, though proving correctness is crucial.
**Two Pointers:** Essential for sorted array problems, sliding windows, or comparing elements from opposite ends. It reduces time complexity by avoiding nested loops.
**Hash Table:** Used for fast lookups, frequency counting, or deduplication. It's frequently combined with other patterns to achieve O(1) access time.

The most critical combined pattern for Airtel is using a **Hash Table with Prefix Sum** to solve subarray sum problems. This pattern efficiently finds subarrays summing to a target. Here is a classic implementation for the problem: "Find the total number of subarrays that sum to k."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarraySum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    sum_freq = {0: 1}  # base case: a prefix sum of 0 occurs once

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        # if (prefix_sum - k) exists, we found a subarray summing to k
        count += sum_freq.get(prefix_sum - k, 0)
        # update frequency of current prefix sum
        sum_freq[prefix_sum] = sum_freq.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1

    return count
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumFreq = new Map();
  sumFreq.set(0, 1); // base case

  for (const num of nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    if (sumFreq.has(prefixSum - k)) {
      count += sumFreq.get(prefixSum - k);
    }
    sumFreq.set(prefixSum, (sumFreq.get(prefixSum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return count;
}
```

```java
public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int count = 0, prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumFreq = new HashMap<>();
    sumFreq.put(0, 1); // base case

    for (int num : nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        count += sumFreq.getOrDefault(prefixSum - k, 0);
        sumFreq.put(prefixSum, sumFreq.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — 4-6 Week Study Plan

A focused, consistent plan is more effective than cramming. Adjust based on your starting point.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Solidify the top five topics. For each, solve 10-15 classic problems on platforms like LeetCode. Focus on understanding the pattern, not just the solution. For example, for Prefix Sum, solve "Range Sum Query - Immutable," "Subarray Sum Equals K," and "Minimum Size Subarray Sum."

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration.** Practice problems that combine two or more patterns. Examples include using Two Pointers with Greedy for "Container With Most Water" or Hash Table with Array for "Two Sum" and its variants. Aim for 15-20 medium-difficulty problems this block, timing yourself to simulate interview conditions.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Review.** In the final stretch, conduct at least 4-6 mock interviews (use platforms like Pramp or practice with a peer). Simulate the full 45-60 minute session: clarify the problem, discuss approaches, write code, and test. Revisit all previously solved problems to ensure you can re-derive the solution without hints. Dedicate time to analyzing your most common error types (e.g., off-by-one errors in loops, edge cases with empty inputs).

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Your Process.** Airtel interviewers evaluate your problem-solving approach. Verbally walk through your reasoning before coding. Discuss brute force first, then optimize. This demonstrates structured thinking.
2.  **Prioritize Correctness Over Cleverness.** With no hard problems, a fully correct, readable solution is better than a buggy, optimal one. Write clean code with meaningful variable names, add comments for complex logic, and test with simple cases before finalizing.
3.  **Master Time and Space Complexity Analysis.** For every solution you propose, be prepared to state and justify the Big O. This is non-negotiable for medium-difficulty questions.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor.** Since you may not have an IDE during the interview, get comfortable writing syntactically correct code without auto-completion. Use a simple notepad for daily practice.
5.  **Don't Ignore the Easy 14%.** Easy questions often test basic string manipulation, array sorting, or hash set usage. Fumbling on these creates a poor first impression. Ensure you can solve them quickly and confidently.

Success in Airtel's coding interviews comes from methodical preparation on their core topics and demonstrating clear, efficient problem-solving under pressure. Start with the patterns, build consistency, and simulate the real environment.
