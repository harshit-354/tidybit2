# ServiceNow vs ByteDance: Interview Question Comparison

Both ServiceNow and ByteDance are major tech employers, but they serve different markets and have distinct engineering cultures. ServiceNow is a leading enterprise SaaS platform focused on workflow automation and IT service management, while ByteDance is a global consumer technology giant behind products like TikTok. Their technical interviews reflect these differences in scope and intensity. This comparison analyzes their question libraries to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

ServiceNow's question bank is larger and slightly more challenging on paper. With 78 total questions categorized as 78 Easy, 58 Medium, and 12 Hard, it presents a broader set of problems to master. The higher count, especially in Medium and Hard categories, suggests a comprehensive interview process that tests depth across a range of problem-solving scenarios. You should expect a methodical interview that values clean, maintainable solutions suitable for enterprise-scale systems.

ByteDance's library is smaller at 64 questions (6 Easy, 49 Medium, 9 Hard), but its distribution is telling. The overwhelming focus is on Medium-difficulty problems, with a minimal number of Easy questions. This indicates an interview loop that quickly moves to substantive, complex problem-solving. The expectation is that candidates can handle nuanced algorithmic challenges under pressure, reflecting the fast-paced, high-scale environment of a consumer tech company.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four core data structures and algorithms: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This significant overlap means foundational preparation is efficient. Mastering these topics will serve you well for either interview.

**Array and String** questions often involve manipulation, searching, and sliding window techniques. **Hash Table** problems focus on efficient lookups and frequency counting. **Dynamic Programming** challenges test your ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

Here is a typical DP problem (Coin Change) you might encounter at both companies:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (i - coin >= 0) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

</div>

The key difference lies in context. ServiceNow problems may have a bent toward data organization and business logic simulation. ByteDance problems might be more abstract, mathematically inclined, or related to real-time data processing.

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **ServiceNow first** if you are early in your interview preparation cycle. Its larger question bank with more Easy and Medium problems provides a structured ramp-up. Solving these will solidify your fundamentals in the core shared topics. The enterprise context also encourages writing clear, robust code—a good habit for any interview.

Switch focus to **ByteDance** once your fundamentals are strong and you need to intensify practice on medium-to-hard problems. The concentrated set of challenging questions is ideal for sharpening your problem-solving speed and ability to handle complexity, which is critical for ByteDance's interview style.

Ultimately, the strong topic overlap makes preparing for one beneficial for the other. Start with the broader foundation ServiceNow's list provides, then drill into the depth emphasized by ByteDance.
