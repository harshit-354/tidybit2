Landing a software engineering role at Pornhub means tackling a rigorous technical interview. The process typically mirrors other top tech companies, involving multiple rounds of coding interviews focused on algorithmic problem-solving, system design, and behavioral questions. Success hinges on targeted preparation. Let's break down what you need to know.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, the question distribution is telling: 13% Easy, 63% Medium, and 25% Hard. This profile is more challenging than average. The low percentage of Easy questions signals there's no "warm-up" round; you're expected to perform at a high level from the start. The dominance of Medium problems forms the core of the interview—these questions test your ability to apply standard algorithms to novel scenarios under pressure. The significant 25% Hard portion is the differentiator. You will likely encounter at least one complex problem designed to push your problem-solving and optimization skills to the limit. This breakdown means your preparation must be comprehensive, covering fundamentals while drilling deeply into advanced patterns.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics provide a clear roadmap for your study. Master these areas.

- **String & Array Manipulation:** The foundation. Expect problems involving in-place transformations, partitioning, and searching.
- **Hash Table:** Your primary tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize brute-force solutions. Essential for frequency counting and mapping relationships.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Critical for the Hard problems. You must recognize when a problem has overlapping subproblems and can be broken down optimally.
- **Sliding Window:** The go-to pattern for problems dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings with specific constraints (e.g., "longest substring with K distinct characters").

The Sliding Window pattern is a perfect example of a high-utility concept for Pornhub's focus on Strings and Arrays. Here is a template for the variable-length window approach:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def sliding_window_template(s: str, target: int) -> int:
    left = 0
    window_map = {}
    max_len = 0  # or min_len, or count

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # 1. Expand window: Add s[right] to window
        window_map[s[right]] = window_map.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # 2. Shrink window while condition is invalid
        while condition_to_shrink(window_map, target):
            window_map[s[left]] -= 1
            if window_map[s[left]] == 0:
                del window_map[s[left]]
            left += 1

        # 3. Update answer after window is valid
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

```javascript
function slidingWindowTemplate(s, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let windowMap = new Map();
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // 1. Expand window
    windowMap.set(s[right], (windowMap.get(s[right]) || 0) + 1);

    // 2. Shrink window while condition is invalid
    while (conditionToShrink(windowMap, target)) {
      windowMap.set(s[left], windowMap.get(s[left]) - 1);
      if (windowMap.get(s[left]) === 0) {
        windowMap.delete(s[left]);
      }
      left++;
    }

    // 3. Update answer
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}
```

```java
public int slidingWindowTemplate(String s, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    Map<Character, Integer> windowMap = new HashMap<>();
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // 1. Expand window
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        windowMap.put(c, windowMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

        // 2. Shrink window while condition is invalid
        while (conditionToShrink(windowMap, target)) {
            char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
            windowMap.put(leftChar, windowMap.get(leftChar) - 1);
            if (windowMap.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                windowMap.remove(leftChar);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // 3. Update answer
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

With the high proportion of Medium and Hard problems, a superficial approach will not work. Follow this intensive plan.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Pattern Recognition.** Don't just solve problems; categorize them. Dedicate each day to a core data structure (Array, String, Hash Table) and a primary algorithm pattern (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search). Solve 2-3 Medium problems per pattern, focusing on understanding the template and when to apply it.

**Weeks 3-4: Depth on High-Yield Topics.** This is your DP and advanced algorithms block. Spend at least 5-7 days solely on Dynamic Programming. Start with classic problems (Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence) to understand memoization and tabulation, then move to harder string/array DP problems. Follow this with deep dives into Graphs (BFS/DFS) and advanced Tree traversals.

**Weeks 5-6: Simulation & Integration.** This phase is about performance under interview conditions. Use the [Pornhub question list on TidyBit](/company/pornhub) as your primary source. Conduct daily 60-90 minute mock interviews where you solve 2-3 problems back-to-back: one Medium and one Hard, or two Mediums. Verbalize your thought process out loud. In the final week, review all your mistakes and re-solve the problems you found most challenging.

## Key Tips

1.  **Optimize From the Start:** Given the difficulty curve, interviewers will expect an optimal or near-optimal solution. Always state the brute-force approach first for clarity, but immediately follow with, "We can optimize this using a [Hash Table/Sliding Window] to achieve O(n) time."
2.  **Master DP State Definition:** For Hard problems, the hardest part is correctly defining `dp[i][j]`. Practice articulating what your DP array represents. A clear definition makes the transition equation easier to derive.
3.  **Communicate Trade-offs:** When using a Hash Table for O(1) lookups, explicitly mention the O(n) space trade-off. This shows you understand the cost of your optimization.
4.  **Practice on Paper/Whiteboard:** At least 20% of your practice should be without an IDE. This builds the muscle memory for writing syntactically correct code under pressure, which is often required in final onsite rounds.

The Pornhub coding interview is a significant challenge, but it's crackable with data-driven, focused preparation. Understand the patterns, drill the high-frequency topics, and simulate the real environment relentlessly.
