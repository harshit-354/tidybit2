When preparing for technical interviews at large tech companies, understanding the specific focus and difficulty of their questions can significantly streamline your study process. Oracle and Walmart Labs both assess core algorithmic skills, but they differ in volume, difficulty distribution, and subtle emphasis, making a targeted approach essential.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is scale. Oracle's list, with **340 questions**, is more than double the size of Walmart Labs' **152 questions**. This doesn't necessarily mean Oracle's interview is harder, but it suggests a broader potential question pool you might encounter.

The difficulty breakdown reveals their screening priorities:

- **Oracle (E70/M205/H65):** Medium difficulty questions dominate, comprising about 60% of the list. This indicates a strong focus on core problem-solving and the application of standard algorithms. The high number of Hard questions (65) suggests they thoroughly test candidates for senior or highly technical roles.
- **Walmart Labs (E22/M105/H25):** The pattern is similar but scaled down, with Medium questions also making up roughly 69% of their list. The proportions are comparable, but the absolute counts are lower across all difficulties. This implies a slightly more contained question scope, though the bar for solving Medium problems remains high.

In practice, this means preparing for Walmart Labs can feel more focused, while preparing for Oracle requires broader coverage to handle the larger question set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily emphasize the same four fundamental topics: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**. This massive overlap is the key takeaway. Mastering these areas is non-negotiable for either company.

- **Array & String:** These are the bedrock for most algorithm problems. Expect questions on two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and string manipulation.
- **Hash Table:** Crucial for optimizing lookups and solving problems related to frequency counting, duplicates, and complementary sums.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A critical topic for medium and hard questions, testing your ability to break down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

The shared focus means a single, strong foundation in data structures and algorithms will serve you for both. You will likely encounter problems like "Two Sum" (Hash Table), "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" (Sliding Window), or "Longest Palindromic Subsequence" (DP).

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach - relevant to both)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach - relevant to both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Hash Table approach - relevant to both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the significant overlap, you should **prepare for Walmart Labs first**. Its smaller, more focused question set allows you to efficiently build and solidify core competency in the essential topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP). Success here means you've covered a substantial portion of the foundational material needed for Oracle.

Once comfortable with the Walmart Labs scope, transition to Oracle preparation by:

1.  **Expanding your practice** within the same four core topics using Oracle's larger question bank.
2.  **Tackling more Hard problems** to meet Oracle's higher count of difficult questions.
3.  **Broadening slightly** into other common topics like Trees, Graphs, and Sorting that may appear more frequently in Oracle's extensive list.

This sequential approach is efficient. You build a strong, confident foundation with the narrower list, then scale up to the broader, deeper list without having to learn entirely new domains.
