When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each can significantly streamline your study. Salesforce and IBM, while both being enterprise giants, present distinct profiles in their technical interview question banks. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics to help you prioritize your preparation effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The total number of cataloged questions and their difficulty spread reveals the expected interview intensity for each company.

**Salesforce** has a larger question bank with **189 questions**. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium and hard problems: 113 Medium (M113) and 49 Hard (H49), with only 27 Easy (E27). This skew indicates that Salesforce interviews are designed to rigorously assess problem-solving under pressure, often involving complex algorithmic thinking and optimization.

**IBM** has a slightly smaller bank of **170 questions**. Its distribution is markedly different, with a strong emphasis on foundational concepts: 52 Easy (E52) and 102 Medium (M102), but only 16 Hard (H16). This profile suggests IBM interviews may focus more on assessing solid coding fundamentals, clarity of thought, and the ability to cleanly implement solutions for common problems, rather than on solving highly obscure or optimized challenges.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures, but with different secondary focuses that hint at their problem-solving priorities.

The primary overlap is on **Array** and **String** manipulation. These are fundamental topics that form the basis of countless interview questions. Mastery here is non-negotiable for both.

**Salesforce's** standout topics are **Hash Table** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The high frequency of Hash Table questions aligns with problems involving efficient lookups, counting, and relationships (e.g., Two Sum variants). The significant presence of DP signals that you must prepare for problems involving optimization, recursion with memoization, and breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems.

**IBM's** distinctive topics are **Two Pointers** and **Sorting**. The Two Pointers technique is crucial for solving problems on sorted arrays or strings, often involving searching, pairing, or in-place manipulation. The focus on Sorting underscores the importance of ordering data as a precursor to efficient solutions and understanding algorithmic efficiency (e.g., `O(n log n)` operations).

Here is a typical problem that could appear at either company, solved using their respective common techniques:

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Salesforce-style: Using Hash Table for a pairing problem
def two_sum_hash(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# IBM-style: Using Two Pointers on a sorted array
def two_sum_pointers(nums, target):
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)  # Sorting step emphasized
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_sorted[left] + nums_sorted[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]  # Indices in sorted array
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Salesforce-style: Hash Table
function twoSumHash(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// IBM-style: Two Pointers
function twoSumPointers(nums, target) {
  const sorted = [...nums].sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sorting step
  let left = 0,
    right = sorted.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = sorted[left] + sorted[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left, right];
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Salesforce-style: Hash Table
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSumHash(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// IBM-style: Two Pointers (requires sorted input)
import java.util.Arrays;

public int[] twoSumPointers(int[] nums, int target) {
    int[] sorted = nums.clone();
    Arrays.sort(sorted); // Explicit sorting step
    int left = 0, right = sorted.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = sorted[left] + sorted[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return new int[]{left, right};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your interview timeline and foundational strength.

If you are interviewing with **both companies**, start with **IBM**. Its heavier focus on Easy and Medium problems, along with core techniques like Sorting and Two Pointers, will help you solidify the fundamentals. This foundation is essential before tackling Salesforce's more challenging DP and optimization-heavy problems. Mastering IBM's pattern will build confidence and speed, which are critical for Salesforce's harder questions.

If you are only targeting one company, tailor your approach:

- For **IBM**, drill deeply into Array, String, Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort), and the Two Pointers technique. Practice writing clean, efficient code for medium-difficulty problems.
- For **Salesforce**, you must build exceptional strength in Hash Table applications and Dynamic Programming. Practice a wide range of DP patterns (0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.) and complex array/string manipulations.

Regardless of your target, always solve problems on the company's tagged list to familiarize yourself with their specific question style and difficulty curve.
