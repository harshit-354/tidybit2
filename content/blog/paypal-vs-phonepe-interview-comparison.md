When preparing for technical interviews at major fintech companies, understanding the specific question patterns and difficulty distributions can significantly focus your study time. Both PayPal and PhonePe ask a high volume of questions centered on core data structures and algorithms, but their emphasis differs in key ways that should inform your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

PayPal's list comprises **106 questions**, with a difficulty distribution skewed toward the middle: **Easy (18), Medium (69), Hard (19)**. This indicates a strong focus on medium-difficulty problems, which often test a solid grasp of fundamentals applied to moderately complex scenarios. You must be proficient in translating problem statements into efficient solutions under typical interview constraints.

PhonePe's list is slightly smaller at **102 questions**, but its difficulty distribution is markedly different: **Easy (3), Medium (63), Hard (36)**. The near-absence of easy questions and the substantial portion of hard problems (over 35%) suggest PhonePe's interviews are designed to be rigorous, probing deeper into algorithmic optimization, edge cases, and complex problem-solving. Success here requires comfort with challenging, multi-layered problems.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize **Array** and **Sorting** problems, making these foundational topics non-negotiable. **Hash Table** is also critical for both, as it's a ubiquitous tool for achieving O(1) lookups and solving frequency-counting or pairing problems.

The primary divergence is in their secondary focus areas.

- **PayPal** prominently features **String** manipulation problems. You should practice anagrams, palindromes, subsequences, and string parsing.
- **PhonePe** places a much heavier emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with its higher proportion of hard questions, as DP is often used for optimization problems involving sequences, grids, or partitioning.

Here is a typical array problem you might encounter, solved using a hash table:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Example: two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) -> [0, 1]
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

</div>

A key DP problem for PhonePe preparation might be the classic "Climbing Stairs":

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **PayPal**. Its concentration on medium-difficulty questions covering Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables provides an excellent foundation in core algorithmic thinking and coding fluency. Mastering these will build the confidence and speed needed for any technical interview. Once this base is solid, transition to **PhonePe**.

Preparing for PhonePe requires a dedicated deep dive into **Dynamic Programming**. You must move beyond memorizing a few patterns to understanding state definition, transition, and optimization for problems involving sequences, grids, and combinatorial choices. The high number of hard problems also means you should practice breaking down complex narratives into solvable algorithmic steps.

In summary, PayPal's list is the better training ground for fundamental competency, while PhonePe's list demands advanced, specialized study, particularly in DP.
