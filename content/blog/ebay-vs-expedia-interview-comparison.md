When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. Both eBay and Expedia ask a high volume of coding questions focused on core data structures, but their difficulty distributions and emphasis on certain problem-solving approaches differ significantly. This comparison breaks down their question profiles to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

eBay's list contains **60 questions**, categorized as 12 Easy, 38 Medium, and 10 Hard. This distribution highlights a strong focus on Medium-difficulty problems, which are typical for assessing a candidate's core problem-solving and implementation skills under interview conditions. The presence of 10 Hard questions indicates you must also be prepared for complex scenarios involving optimization or advanced data structure manipulation.

Expedia's list is slightly smaller at **54 questions**, with 13 Easy, 35 Medium, and only 6 Hard. This profile suggests a marginally more accessible difficulty curve, with a heavier concentration on Medium problems and a smaller hurdle of highly complex questions. The overall volume for both companies is substantial, requiring dedicated, problem-focused practice rather than last-minute cramming.

## Topic Overlap

The core technical overlap between eBay and Expedia is considerable, making preparation for one highly beneficial for the other.

- **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the backbone of both question sets. Mastery here is non-negotiable. You must be fluent in techniques like two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums for arrays and strings, and in using hash maps for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common pattern)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common pattern)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (currentSum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer for a sorted array (common pattern)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

- **Sorting** is explicitly listed for eBay, implying questions may involve custom comparators or algorithms where sorting is a key preprocessing step.
- **Greedy** algorithms are explicitly listed for Expedia. This signals you should practice problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a global solution, such as activity selection or interval scheduling problems.

The main difference is one of emphasis: eBay's list suggests a slightly broader algorithmic scope with Sorting, while Expedia's points toward a specific need to review Greedy strategies.

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **eBay**. Its larger number of Hard questions (10 vs. 6) and inclusion of Sorting means your study plan will naturally cover a wider and slightly more challenging range of problems. If you can comfortably solve eBay's Medium and Hard questions, you will have effectively covered the core of Expedia's list (Array, String, Hash Table) and will only need to supplement your knowledge with focused practice on **Greedy algorithms**.

A practical strategy is to:

1.  Work through the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) using eBay's problem list.
2.  Integrate Sorting problems and ensure you can tackle several Hard-level questions.
3.  Shift to Expedia's list, using it for additional practice on the core topics and specifically targeting any questions tagged with Greedy.

This approach builds a stronger foundation first, making subsequent preparation more efficient.
