When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company can dramatically improve your efficiency. TikTok and DE Shaw represent two distinct ends of the tech and finance spectrum, and their interview question patterns reflect their different engineering cultures. This comparison analyzes their question volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer volume of questions in their respective tagged lists on platforms like LeetCode. TikTok's list contains **383 questions**, dwarfing DE Shaw's **124 questions**. This suggests a broader, more rapidly evolving question pool for TikTok, likely due to its large scale, frequent hiring, and the public nature of its interview process.

The difficulty distributions also provide insight:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** Medium difficulty questions are the overwhelming majority at ~68% of the list. This aligns with the standard software engineering interview format, where solving one or two medium problems optimally is often the baseline for passing a coding round. The significant number of Hard questions (~21%) indicates that for senior or specialized roles, you must be prepared for complex scenarios.
- **DE Shaw (E12/M74/H38):** The distribution is proportionally similar, with Medium questions making up ~60% of the list. However, the absolute numbers are much smaller. This implies a more curated, possibly deeper focus on a core set of challenging concepts rather than a wide net. The higher proportional representation of Hard questions (~31%) can signal an expectation for robust, optimal solutions even in initial screenings, which is characteristic of quantitative and trading firms.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures and algorithms, with significant overlap in their top topics.

**Core Shared Topics:** Array, String, and Dynamic Programming are top priorities for both. Mastery here is non-negotiable.

- **Array/String** questions test fundamental manipulation, two-pointer techniques, sliding window, and binary search.
- **Dynamic Programming** is critical for both, but often with a different flavor. TikTok DP might relate to user features or system design, while DE Shaw's DP problems frequently model optimization, probability, or financial scenarios.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **TikTok's Emphasis:** **Hash Table** is its second most frequent topic. This underscores the importance of efficient lookups and data association, crucial for social media features like follower graphs, content tagging, and caching. Expect many problems that combine hash maps with other techniques.
- **DE Shaw's Emphasis:** **Greedy** algorithms are a top-four topic. This highlights the company's focus on problems involving optimal decision-making, resource allocation, and finding efficient, incremental solutions—skills directly transferable to trading and quantitative strategy.

```python
# Example: A problem combining Hash Table (TikTok emphasis) and Two-Pointer
def max_subarray_length(nums, k):
    freq = {}
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        freq[nums[right]] = freq.get(nums[right], 0) + 1
        while freq[nums[right]] > k:
            freq[nums[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len

# Example: A classic Greedy problem (DE Shaw emphasis)
def max_profit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
    return max_profit
```

```javascript
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table (TikTok emphasis) and Two-Pointer
function maxSubarrayLength(nums, k) {
  const freq = new Map();
  let left = 0;
  let maxLen = 0;
  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    freq.set(nums[right], (freq.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
    while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
      freq.set(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]) - 1);
      left++;
    }
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
  }
  return maxLen;
}

// Example: A classic Greedy problem (DE Shaw emphasis)
function maxProfit(prices) {
  let minPrice = Infinity;
  let maxProfit = 0;
  for (const price of prices) {
    minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
    maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
  }
  return maxProfit;
}
```

```java
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table (TikTok emphasis) and Two-Pointer
public int maxSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        freq.put(nums[right], freq.getOrDefault(nums[right], 0) + 1);
        while (freq.get(nums[right]) > k) {
            freq.put(nums[left], freq.get(nums[left]) - 1);
            left++;
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
}

// Example: A classic Greedy problem (DE Shaw emphasis)
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int maxProfit = 0;
    for (int price : prices) {
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
    }
    return maxProfit;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **DE Shaw's list**. Its smaller, more concentrated set of 124 questions, with a high density of Medium and Hard problems, forces you to deeply understand core algorithmic patterns like DP and Greedy. Solving these will build a strong, versatile foundation. Once you are comfortable here, transitioning to **TikTok's list** will be more about expanding your breadth and speed. You can focus on practicing the high volume of Medium problems and the additional Hash Table-focused variations, using your solid core skills to solve them efficiently.

This approach ensures you build depth first, then add breadth, making you well-prepared for both the rigorous optimization expected at DE Shaw and the fast-paced, broad problem-solving common at TikTok.
