When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically improve your efficiency. Meta and Snapchat, while both testing core computer science fundamentals, present distinct landscapes in terms of volume, difficulty distribution, and topical emphasis. This comparison breaks down their interview question profiles to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer scale of Meta's question bank is its most defining characteristic. With **1,387** cataloged questions, it dwarfs Snapchat's **99**. This volume reflects Meta's vast historical interview data and the breadth of its engineering roles.

More telling is the difficulty distribution:

- **Meta:** Easy: 414 (30%), Medium: 762 (55%), Hard: 211 (15%)
- **Snapchat:** Easy: 6 (6%), Medium: 62 (63%), Hard: 31 (31%)

Meta's distribution is classic, centered on Medium-difficulty problems that test applied knowledge. Snapchat's profile is notably more challenging, with a heavy skew towards Medium and Hard questions, and a minimal number of Easy ones. This suggests Snapchat interviews may dive into complex problem-solving more quickly.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational data structures and algorithms.

**Shared Core Topics:** Array, String, and Hash Table problems are prevalent at both. These form the bedrock of most coding interviews. A strong command here is non-negotiable for either company.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Meta** prominently features **Math** problems. This includes number theory, probability, and other mathematical reasoning challenges integrated into algorithmic questions.
- **Snapchat** shows a marked emphasis on **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This indicates a higher likelihood of encountering graph traversal, shortest path in unweighted graphs, and level-order tree traversal problems.

This divergence influences preparation. For Meta, practicing mathematical reasoning and bit manipulation is crucial. For Snapchat, deep fluency in graph algorithms—particularly BFS and its applications—is a high-yield investment.

**Example: A Hash Table & BFS Problem (Snapchat-favored)**

<div class="code-group">

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def word_ladder(begin_word, end_word, word_list):
    if end_word not in word_list:
        return 0
    L = len(begin_word)
    all_combo_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for word in word_list:
        for i in range(L):
            all_combo_dict[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]].append(word)
    queue = deque([(begin_word, 1)])
    visited = {begin_word}
    while queue:
        current_word, level = queue.popleft()
        for i in range(L):
            intermediate = current_word[:i] + "*" + current_word[i+1:]
            for word in all_combo_dict[intermediate]:
                if word == end_word:
                    return level + 1
                if word not in visited:
                    visited.add(word)
                    queue.append((word, level + 1))
    return 0
```

```javascript
function wordLadder(beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
  if (!wordList.includes(endWord)) return 0;
  const L = beginWord.length;
  const allComboDict = new Map();
  wordList.forEach((word) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < L; i++) {
      const key = word.substring(0, i) + "*" + word.substring(i + 1);
      const list = allComboDict.get(key) || [];
      list.push(word);
      allComboDict.set(key, list);
    }
  });
  const queue = [[beginWord, 1]];
  const visited = new Set([beginWord]);
  while (queue.length) {
    const [currentWord, level] = queue.shift();
    for (let i = 0; i < L; i++) {
      const intermediate = currentWord.substring(0, i) + "*" + currentWord.substring(i + 1);
      for (const word of allComboDict.get(intermediate) || []) {
        if (word === endWord) return level + 1;
        if (!visited.has(word)) {
          visited.add(word);
          queue.push([word, level + 1]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        if (!wordList.contains(endWord)) return 0;
        int L = beginWord.length();
        Map<String, List<String>> allComboDict = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : wordList) {
            for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
                String key = word.substring(0, i) + "*" + word.substring(i + 1);
                allComboDict.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(word);
            }
        }
        Queue<Pair<String, Integer>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new Pair<>(beginWord, 1));
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(beginWord);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Pair<String, Integer> node = queue.poll();
            String currentWord = node.getKey();
            int level = node.getValue();
            for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
                String intermediate = currentWord.substring(0, i) + "*" + currentWord.substring(i + 1);
                for (String word : allComboDict.getOrDefault(intermediate, new ArrayList<>())) {
                    if (word.equals(endWord)) return level + 1;
                    if (!visited.contains(word)) {
                        visited.add(word);
                        queue.add(new Pair<>(word, level + 1));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Meta**. Its enormous, well-balanced question bank covers the universal core of technical interviews—arrays, strings, hash tables, dynamic programming, and trees. Mastering these patterns will build a robust foundation applicable to almost any company, including Snapchat. The process of working through Meta's high volume of Medium problems is excellent general practice.

Once this foundation is solid, pivot to **Snapchat-specific preparation**. This involves:

1.  **Focusing on graph algorithms**, especially BFS and its variations for shortest path problems.
2.  **Practicing harder problems** to acclimate to a higher difficulty ceiling.
3.  **Tackling Snapchat's curated question list** directly, as its smaller size makes targeted review feasible.

In essence, use Meta's curriculum for breadth and foundational strength, then sharpen your skills with Snapchat's deeper, more graph-focused challenges.
