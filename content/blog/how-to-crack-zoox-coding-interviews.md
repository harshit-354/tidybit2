Zoox interviews test your ability to solve practical, often mathematically-inclined problems under pressure. The process typically involves multiple rounds of technical coding interviews focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, system design, and behavioral questions. For the coding portion, you'll be expected to write clean, efficient code and communicate your thought process clearly. The data shows a clear pattern in what they ask.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on an analysis of recent Zoox interview questions, the difficulty distribution is revealing: **Easy: 1 (14%), Medium: 5 (71%), Hard: 1 (14%)**. This breakdown tells you exactly how to allocate your study time. The overwhelming focus is on Medium-difficulty problems. These questions require more than just knowing a concept; they demand that you correctly implement a non-trivial algorithm, often combining multiple patterns or requiring careful edge-case handling. The single Hard problem suggests they are looking for candidates who can tackle complex optimization, likely in Dynamic Programming. The minimal presence of Easy questions means you cannot afford to be rusty on fundamentals—they are the assumed baseline.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are **Array, String, Math, Dynamic Programming, and Counting**. Here’s how to approach each:

- **Array & String:** These are the fundamental data structures for most problems. Expect manipulations, sliding windows, and two-pointer techniques. Master in-place operations and substring searches.
- **Math:** Zoox problems often have a mathematical angle, involving number properties, modular arithmetic, or combinatorics. Practice translating word problems into formulas.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** This is the key topic for their hardest problems. You must be comfortable identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, especially for 1D and 2D DP.
- **Counting:** Frequently appears alongside Arrays and Strings. Problems involve frequency maps (hashtables) to track characters, numbers, or events to find duplicates, anagrams, or majority elements.

The most critical pattern to master is **Dynamic Programming**. A classic example is finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). This pattern appears in various disguises.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
  if (!nums.length) return 0;
  // dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return Math.max(...dp);
}
```

```java
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    // dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
    int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
    Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
    int maxAns = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxAns;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics.**
Spend the first two weeks intensively covering the top five topics. For each topic (Array, String, Math, DP, Counting), solve 10-15 curated Medium problems. Use a mix of learning resources. Focus on understanding the pattern first, then implement it without help. This phase is about building your pattern recognition muscle memory.

**Weeks 3-4: Mixed Practice & Mock Interviews.**
Stop solving problems by topic. Start doing random Medium and occasional Hard problems from a broad question bank. This simulates the actual interview where you won't know the category. Begin doing timed mock interviews—ideally with a peer or using a platform that records you. Practice verbalizing your thought process from problem analysis to brute force to optimized solution.

**Weeks 5-6: Company-Specific & Final Review.**
Dedicate this period to Zoox-specific questions. Solve every available past problem. Look for common themes: do they favor graph problems related to routing? Math problems related to sensors or probabilities? Also, revisit your weakest areas from the first month. In the final days, do not learn new concepts; instead, re-solve key problems from memory to ensure fluency.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** Never go silent. Narrate your initial thoughts, discuss trade-offs between approaches, and explain your code as you write it. An interviewer who understands your reasoning is more likely to guide you if you get stuck.
2.  **Start with Brute Force.** Immediately stating a brute force solution shows you can solve the problem and gives you a starting point for optimization. Clearly say, "This would be O(n^2) time, but we can improve it by..."
3.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Before declaring your solution complete, verbally run through small examples, empty inputs, single-element inputs, and large values. This demonstrates thoroughness and often catches bugs.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard.** Code without an IDE's autocomplete. Write syntactically correct code on paper or a whiteboard. This is a different skill than typing in an editor and is often required in onsite interviews.

Success in a Zoox interview comes from methodical preparation focused on their specific profile of Medium-difficulty problems with a mathematical and optimization slant. Practice the patterns, then practice communicating them.
