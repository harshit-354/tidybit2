When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus and patterns of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. Amazon and LinkedIn, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and topic emphasis. A targeted approach based on these differences is crucial.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most striking difference is the sheer scale of the question pools.

**Amazon** maintains a massive, well-documented repository of **1,938 questions**, as tracked on platforms like TidyBit. This volume reflects Amazon's vast engineering organization and standardized, process-driven interview loop. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium-level problems: approximately 55% Medium (M1057), 27% Easy (E530), and 18% Hard (H351). This suggests a strong focus on assessing a candidate's ability to reliably solve complex, real-world problems under pressure, with a solid foundation in fundamentals.

**LinkedIn's** question pool is significantly more concentrated, with around **180 questions**. The difficulty distribution is radically different: a massive 65% are Medium difficulty (M117), with only about 14% Easy (E26) and 21% Hard (H37). This indicates a laser focus on core, practical problem-solving. The smaller pool means questions are more likely to be repeated, making deep, mastery-level practice on these specific problems highly valuable.

```python
# Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Mastery of such fundamentals is critical for both companies.
```

```javascript
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example of a common "Medium" difficulty pattern: Two Sum (Hash Table)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems form the essential backbone for interviews at both Amazon and LinkedIn. These topics test fundamental manipulation, efficiency, and design.

The key divergence is in the next layer of focus. **Amazon** shows a significant emphasis on **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, a topic notorious for its difficulty and frequent appearance in Amazon interviews. Preparing for Amazon requires dedicated study of DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, etc.).

**LinkedIn**, conversely, places a notable emphasis on **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, often in the context of tree and graph traversal. This aligns with problems involving hierarchical data, connections, or social networks.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# LinkedIn Focus: DFS on a binary tree.
def dfs(node, target):
    if not node:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True
    return dfs(node.left, target) or dfs(node.right, target)

# Amazon Focus: A simple DP example (Climbing Stairs).
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// LinkedIn Focus: DFS on a binary tree.
function dfs(node, target) {
  if (!node) return false;
  if (node.val === target) return true;
  return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}

// Amazon Focus: A simple DP example (Climbing Stairs).
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// LinkedIn Focus: DFS on a binary tree.
public boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int target) {
    if (node == null) return false;
    if (node.val == target) return true;
    return dfs(node.left, target) || dfs(node.right, target);
}

// Amazon Focus: A simple DP example (Climbing Stairs).
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **LinkedIn**. Its concentrated question list allows for efficient, deep preparation. You can achieve coverage and build confidence by mastering a smaller set of high-probability, medium-difficulty problems. This foundation in core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and DFS will serve you well universally.

Then, move to **Amazon**. Use the broader foundation from LinkedIn prep to tackle Amazon's vast pool. The additional, critical step is to systematically study **Dynamic Programming**, as it is a major differentiator. Amazon's interview process also heavily incorporates Leadership Principles, so behavioral preparation is equally important.

In summary, LinkedIn's interview is a sprint focused on core algorithmic execution, while Amazon's is a marathon testing breadth, depth (especially in DP), and behavioral fit. Master the focused list first, then expand to cover the extensive one.
