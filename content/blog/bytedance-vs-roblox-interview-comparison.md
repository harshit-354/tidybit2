When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. ByteDance (parent company of TikTok) and Roblox (the popular gaming platform) both present rigorous coding challenges, but with distinct profiles in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis. This comparison analyzes their question banks to help you tailor your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers reveal an immediate difference in scope and challenge distribution.

ByteDance's question bank is larger, with **64 total questions** categorized as 64 Easy, 49 Medium, and 9 Hard. This indicates a strong emphasis on **Medium-difficulty problems**, which form the core of their interview process. The relatively low number of Hard questions suggests that while the interviews are demanding, they may prioritize clean, optimal solutions to complex-but-not-esoteric problems over extremely niche algorithms.

Roblox's bank is slightly smaller at **56 questions**, with a distribution of 8 Easy, 36 Medium, and 12 Hard. The key contrast here is the **higher proportion of Hard questions**. This signals that Roblox interviews may delve deeper into algorithmic optimization and complex problem-solving, potentially reflecting the performance-critical and systems-oriented nature of their gaming and simulation platform.

**Takeaway:** ByteDance tests breadth and consistency across many medium problems, while Roblox may probe depth with a sharper focus on challenging scenarios.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures, but with subtle priority shifts.

The core overlap is significant: **Array, String, and Hash Table** problems are paramount for both. You cannot afford weakness here. Dynamic Programming (DP) and Math, however, show where their paths diverge.

**ByteDance** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming** as a top topic. Expect problems involving optimization, memoization, and state transition, often applied to string or array manipulation.

```python
# ByteDance-style DP example: Climbing Stairs
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// ByteDance-style DP example: Climbing Stairs
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// ByteDance-style DP example: Climbing Stairs
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

**Roblox** highlights **Math** as a key category. This can range from number theory and combinatorics to simulation problems and geometric calculations, aligning with game development fundamentals.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Roblox-style Math example: Reverse Integer
def reverse(x: int) -> int:
    INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1
    rev = 0
    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
    x = abs(x)
    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10
        x //= 10
        # Check for overflow before multiplying
        if rev > (INT_MAX - pop) // 10:
            return 0
        rev = rev * 10 + pop
    return rev * sign
```

```javascript
// Roblox-style Math example: Reverse Integer
function reverse(x) {
  const INT_MAX = 2 ** 31 - 1;
  const INT_MIN = -(2 ** 31);
  let rev = 0;
  while (x !== 0) {
    const pop = x % 10;
    x = Math.trunc(x / 10);
    if (rev > Math.floor((INT_MAX - pop) / 10) || rev < Math.ceil((INT_MIN - pop) / 10)) {
      return 0;
    }
    rev = rev * 10 + pop;
  }
  return rev;
}
```

```java
// Roblox-style Math example: Reverse Integer
public int reverse(int x) {
    int rev = 0;
    while (x != 0) {
        int pop = x % 10;
        x /= 10;
        if (rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
        if (rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 || (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
        rev = rev * 10 + pop;
    }
    return rev;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with the **shared foundation**. Grind problems on **Arrays, Hash Tables, and Strings** until you can solve medium-difficulty variations quickly and optimally. This core preparation is 80% effective for both companies.

If your goal is to interview at both, **prepare for ByteDance first**. Its larger bank of Medium problems will solidify your general problem-solving skills and DP knowledge. Mastering this broader base makes transitioning to Roblox's specific Hard problems and math-focused questions more manageable, as you'll already have strong algorithmic instincts.

If targeting only one company, specialize: drill DP patterns for ByteDance, and practice mathematical/geometric algorithms and complex system simulation for Roblox.
