When preparing for technical interviews at top companies, understanding their specific question patterns and focus areas can dramatically improve your efficiency. JPMorgan and Atlassian, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks. JPMorgan's list is larger and leans more towards foundational concepts, whereas Atlassian's is slightly smaller but features a higher proportion of challenging problems. A strategic approach to studying their respective question sets can help you allocate your preparation time effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the total number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

**JPMorgan** has a larger question bank with **78 questions**, broken down as **Easy: 25, Medium: 45, Hard: 8**. This higher volume, particularly in the Easy and Medium categories, suggests that breadth of practice across core concepts is crucial. Success here likely depends on consistent, error-free execution on a wide range of standard problems.

**Atlassian** has a smaller bank of **62 questions**, with a more challenging mix: **Easy: 7, Medium: 43, Hard: 12**. The starkly lower number of Easy questions and the doubled count of Hard problems indicate that Atlassian interviews place a greater emphasis on depth, complex problem-solving, and optimizing solutions under pressure.

This contrast highlights a key preparation strategy: for JPMorgan, prioritize covering a wide array of problems to avoid surprises. For Atlassian, dive deep into Medium problems and ensure you are comfortable deriving and coding optimal solutions for complex scenarios.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four fundamental data structures: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting**. This significant overlap is good news for candidates, as core preparation in these areas serves both companies.

- **Array and String** manipulations form the bedrock of questions for both. You must be proficient in two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and prefix sums.
- **Hash Table** usage for efficient lookups and frequency counting is a universal pattern.
- **Sorting** is often a prerequisite step or the core of the solution itself.

Given this overlap, mastering these topics is your highest-return investment. The implementation of a common pattern, like a sliding window with a hash map, is essential for both.

```python
# Example: Sliding Window with Hash Map (Finding anagrams)
def findAnagrams(s, p):
    p_count = {}
    window_count = {}
    for char in p:
        p_count[char] = p_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    result = []
    left = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Add char at 'right' to window
        window_count[s[right]] = window_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # If window is the size of p, check and slide
        if right - left + 1 == len(p):
            if window_count == p_count:
                result.append(left)
            # Remove char at 'left' before sliding
            window_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if window_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del window_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
    return result
```

```javascript
// Example: Sliding Window with Hash Map (Finding anagrams)
function findAnagrams(s, p) {
  const pCount = new Map();
  const windowCount = new Map();
  for (let char of p) {
    pCount.set(char, (pCount.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }

  const result = [];
  let left = 0;
  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    // Add char at 'right' to window
    const rChar = s[right];
    windowCount.set(rChar, (windowCount.get(rChar) || 0) + 1);

    // If window is the size of p, check and slide
    if (right - left + 1 === p.length) {
      if (mapsAreEqual(windowCount, pCount)) {
        result.push(left);
      }
      // Remove char at 'left' before sliding
      const lChar = s[left];
      windowCount.set(lChar, windowCount.get(lChar) - 1);
      if (windowCount.get(lChar) === 0) {
        windowCount.delete(lChar);
      }
      left++;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

function mapsAreEqual(map1, map2) {
  if (map1.size !== map2.size) return false;
  for (let [key, val] of map1) {
    if (val !== map2.get(key)) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

```java
// Example: Sliding Window with Hash Map (Finding anagrams)
import java.util.*;

public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (s.length() < p.length()) return result;

    Map<Character, Integer> pCount = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> windowCount = new HashMap<>();

    for (char c : p.toCharArray()) {
        pCount.put(c, pCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }

    int left = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        // Add char at 'right' to window
        char rChar = s.charAt(right);
        windowCount.put(rChar, windowCount.getOrDefault(rChar, 0) + 1);

        // If window is the size of p, check and slide
        if (right - left + 1 == p.length()) {
            if (windowCount.equals(pCount)) {
                result.add(left);
            }
            // Remove char at 'left' before sliding
            char lChar = s.charAt(left);
            windowCount.put(lChar, windowCount.get(lChar) - 1);
            if (windowCount.get(lChar) == 0) {
                windowCount.remove(lChar);
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **JPMorgan**. Its larger bank of predominantly Easy and Medium problems provides an excellent, structured path to solidify your fundamentals across the core overlapping topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting). This builds the broad base of competency and speed needed for any technical interview. Once you are consistently solving these problems, transition to **Atlassian's** question set. This progression naturally increases the difficulty, forcing you to apply your solidified fundamentals to more complex Hard problems and optimized Mediums, which is precisely what Atlassian's interview assesses.

In summary, use JPMorgan's questions for breadth and foundational mastery, then use Atlassian's to test and deepen that knowledge under more demanding conditions. The shared focus on core data structures makes this a highly efficient preparation strategy for both.
