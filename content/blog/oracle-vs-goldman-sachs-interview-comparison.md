When preparing for technical interviews at major tech and finance companies, understanding the specific focus and demands of each can significantly streamline your preparation. Oracle and Goldman Sachs, while operating in different sectors, share a surprising amount of common ground in their technical screening processes. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals key differences in volume and subtle shifts in emphasis, despite a strong core topic overlap.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

Oracle presents a larger overall question bank with 340 questions compared to Goldman Sachs' 270. This larger pool suggests a broader range of potential problems or more variety in how core concepts are tested.

Breaking down by difficulty:

- **Oracle:** 70 Easy, 205 Medium, 65 Hard.
- **Goldman Sachs:** 51 Easy, 171 Medium, 48 Hard.

The distribution is remarkably proportional. Both companies heavily weight Medium-difficulty questions, which form about 60% of each bank. Oracle's slightly higher counts across all categories align with its larger total. The key takeaway is that **mastery of Medium-difficulty problems is the critical success factor for both companies.** The difference in total volume means preparing for Oracle might require covering a wider set of problem variations.

## Topic Overlap

The listed core topics for both companies are identical: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming.** This indicates a shared foundation in assessing a candidate's grasp of data structure manipulation and algorithmic optimization. However, the application context often differs.

- **Arrays & Strings:** These are fundamental for both. Questions often involve traversal, sorting, searching, and two-pointer or sliding window techniques.
- **Hash Tables:** Used for efficient lookups, frequency counting, and solving problems related to duplicates or pairs.

```python
# Example: Two-sum using Hash Table (common to both)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-sum using Hash Table (common to both)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-sum using Hash Table (common to both)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

- **Dynamic Programming:** A major focus for both, testing optimal substructure and memoization. Oracle, with its software and systems background, might frame DP problems around optimization, strings (e.g., edit distance), or sequences. Goldman Sachs, in a financial context, might lean towards DP problems that model decision-making over time, combinatorial counts, or problems that can be analogous to financial optimization (e.g., knapsack variants for resource allocation).

## Which to Prepare for First

Given the substantial overlap in core topics, a unified preparation strategy is highly efficient. **Start by solidifying the four common topics: Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming.** Prioritize Medium-difficulty problems, as they dominate both interviews.

A practical approach is to **prepare for Goldman Sachs first**. Its slightly smaller question bank (270 questions) covers the essential patterns that are also critical for Oracle. Achieving proficiency here builds a strong, focused foundation. You can then transition to Oracle-specific preparation by tackling the additional ~70 questions in its bank, which will often be extensions or deeper variations of the concepts you've already mastered. This sequential method prevents feeling overwhelmed by Oracle's larger volume from the start and ensures you build competency on the shared core before expanding.

In essence, the interview landscapes are more similar than different. A candidate well-prepared for Goldman Sachs is already 80% prepared for Oracle, and vice-versa. The final step is targeted practice with each company's unique problem set to adapt to any subtle contextual differences.
