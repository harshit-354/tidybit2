When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and emphasis of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. PayPal and Nutanix, while both respected in the tech industry, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question libraries. PayPal's list is larger and more focused on core data structures, while Nutanix's is smaller but introduces a greater emphasis on graph traversal.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers reveal a clear difference in interview scope. PayPal's catalog of **106 questions** is significantly larger than Nutanix's **68 questions**. This suggests that PayPal's question pool is broader, and candidates might encounter a wider variety of problems, even if core topics are repeated.

The difficulty distribution also differs:

- **PayPal (E18/M69/H19):** The majority (65%) of questions are Medium difficulty, with a nearly even split between Easy (17%) and Hard (18%). This indicates a strong, balanced focus on problems that require applying known algorithms to non-trivial scenarios.
- **Nutanix (E5/M46/H17):** The distribution skews even more heavily toward Medium (68%), with a smaller proportion of Easy questions (7%) and a similar Hard proportion (25%) to PayPal. The lower Easy count suggests Nutanix interviews may dive into complex problem-solving more quickly.

In practice, both companies center their interviews on Medium-level challenges, but you should be prepared for a slightly higher chance of a Hard problem at Nutanix relative to the total question set.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, Hash Table, and String** problems form the core of both question banks. Mastering these is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differentiator is the fourth most frequent topic for each:

- **PayPal:** **Sorting**. This emphasizes the importance of not just knowing sort functions, but deeply understanding comparison-based sorts, counting sorts, and how to use sorting as a pre-processing step to enable efficient solutions (e.g., two-pointer techniques).
- **Nutanix:** **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. This signals that graph and tree traversal is a critical area for Nutanix. You must be comfortable with recursive and iterative DFS, cycle detection, and problems involving adjacency lists or tree nodes.

This divergence means your preparation should branch after solidifying the common core. For PayPal, prioritize problems that involve sorting algorithms or leverage sorted order. For Nutanix, ensure you are fluent in graph representations and traversal.

```python
# Example: A common pattern leveraging sorting (Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Example: Classic DFS on a graph (recursive)
def dfs(node, graph, visited):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    print(node)  # Process node
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor, graph, visited)
```

```javascript
// Example: A common pattern leveraging sorting (Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Classic DFS on a graph (recursive)
function dfs(node, graph, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  console.log(node); // Process node
  for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
  }
}
```

```java
// Example: A common pattern leveraging sorting (Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Example: Classic DFS on a graph (recursive)
public void dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited) {
    if (visited[node]) return;
    visited[node] = true;
    System.out.println(node); // Process node
    for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
    }
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **PayPal**. Its larger question bank and intense focus on Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting will force you to build a rock-solid foundation in the most universal data structures and algorithms. These skills are 100% transferable and form the essential core for any technical interview, including Nutanix's.

Once you are confident with PayPal's core topics, pivot to **Nutanix-specific preparation**. This primarily involves deepening your knowledge of **graph data structures, DFS, and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Since the core topics overlap, this transition is efficient. You'll be adding a new domain (graphs) on top of a strong base, rather than learning two disjoint sets of material.

In summary, use PayPal's list to build your generalist strength, then specialize with Nutanix's graph-focused problems. This approach maximizes the overlap in your study and ensures you are well-prepared for both.
