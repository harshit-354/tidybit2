When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. Infosys and Expedia represent two distinct ends of the software engineering interview spectrum: one a global IT services and consulting giant, the other a leading online travel technology company. Their technical assessments reflect their different business models and engineering needs. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear strategic differences in volume, difficulty, and focus.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of the question pool. Infosys's catalog is significantly larger, with **158 questions** compared to Expedia's **54**. This suggests that Infosys, which hires at a massive scale for diverse roles and projects, draws from a broader, more generalized set of problems. The difficulty distribution also tells a story.

- **Infosys (E42/M82/H34):** The majority of questions are Medium (82), with a substantial number of Easy (42) and Hard (34) problems. This wide distribution indicates a screening process that tests fundamental coding ability, solid problem-solving, and the capacity to tackle complex challenges, likely catering to a wide variance in role seniority and specialization.
- **Expedia (E13/M35/H6):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty questions (35), with a modest number of Easy (13) and very few Hard (6) problems. This points to an interview process designed to assess strong, practical coding and problem-solving skills for building and maintaining large-scale consumer applications, with less emphasis on extreme algorithmic optimization.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core computer science fundamentals, but with different secondary emphases.

**Shared Core Topics:** **Array** and **String** manipulation are critical for both. These form the bedrock of data handling and are essential for any software role.

**Diverging Specializations:**

- **Infosys** places a strong additional emphasis on **Dynamic Programming** and **Math**. DP questions test advanced problem decomposition and optimization, valuable for complex system design and algorithmic solutions in consulting projects. Math problems assess logical and analytical reasoning.
- **Expedia** frequently tests **Hash Table** and **Greedy** algorithms. Hash tables are fundamental for efficient data lookup and are ubiquitous in high-performance web services (e.g., caching user sessions, quick searches). Greedy algorithms are practical for optimization problems common in travel tech, like resource allocation or scheduling.

**Example: A Common Array Problem**
A typical question might be "Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray."

<div class="code-group">

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    max_current = max_global = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current)
    return max_global
```

```javascript
function maxSubarray(nums) {
  let maxCurrent = nums[0];
  let maxGlobal = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
    maxGlobal = Math.max(maxGlobal, maxCurrent);
  }
  return maxGlobal;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int maxCurrent = nums[0];
    int maxGlobal = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        maxCurrent = Math.max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i]);
        maxGlobal = Math.max(maxGlobal, maxCurrent);
    }
    return maxGlobal;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should align with your target role and the foundational breadth of the interview content.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation cycle or targeting a role that requires broad algorithmic knowledge. The larger, more varied question bank with a significant number of Dynamic Programming and Math problems will force you to build a wide and deep foundation. Mastering this scope will make transitioning to other company patterns, including Expedia's, more manageable.

**Prepare for Expedia first if:** You are specifically targeting product-based tech companies or roles focused on building scalable web applications. The concentrated set of Medium-difficulty problems on Arrays, Strings, and Hash Tables is an excellent target for efficient, focused practice. It allows you to drill deeply into the most common, practical problems without initially getting bogged down in the more esoteric Hard or DP problems prevalent in other question banks.

In summary, Infosys offers a comprehensive, foundational grind, while Expedia provides a focused, practical filter. Starting with Infosys builds general strength; starting with Expedia hones a specific, high-demand skillset.
