When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific question patterns is crucial for efficient study. TikTok and Zoho represent two distinct ends of the tech industry spectrum—a global social media giant and a major enterprise software provider—yet their technical interviews reveal significant overlap in core computer science fundamentals. This comparison analyzes their question banks on TidyBit to guide your preparation strategy.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

TikTok's interview process is notoriously rigorous, reflected in its larger question bank of 383 problems. The distribution (Easy: 42, Medium: 260, Hard: 81) shows a heavy emphasis on Medium and Hard problems. This suggests TikTok interviews are designed to assess deep problem-solving skills and algorithmic optimization under pressure, typical of high-growth, competition-driven tech companies.

Zoho's bank is smaller at 179 questions, with a noticeably different difficulty spread (Easy: 62, Medium: 97, Hard: 20). The higher proportion of Easy problems and lower count of Hard ones indicates Zoho's interviews may place a stronger initial focus on foundational correctness and practical implementation, though Medium problems still form the core of their assessment.

**Key Takeaway:** TikTok's interview likely involves more complex problem-solving steps and optimization challenges, while Zoho's may start with more straightforward implementations before progressing to moderate complexity.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the same four core topics: **Array**, **String**, **Hash Table**, and **Dynamic Programming**. This overlap is your strategic advantage.

- **Array and String** manipulations are fundamental. Expect problems involving traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and in-place modifications.
<div class="code-group">

```python
# Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place (Python)
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    s_list = list(s)
    while left < right:
        s_list[left], s_list[right] = s_list[right], s_list[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return ''.join(s_list)
```

```javascript
// Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place (JavaScript)
function reverseString(s) {
  let arr = s.split("");
  let left = 0,
    right = s.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return arr.join("");
}
```

```java
// Two-pointer example: Reversing a string in-place (Java)
public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

- **Hash Tables** are critical for efficient lookups and frequency counting problems common at both companies.
- **Dynamic Programming** appears in both sets, signaling its importance for optimizing recursive problems with overlapping subproblems. Mastering classic DP patterns (Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS) is essential.

The shared focus means mastering these four areas provides a strong foundation for interviews at either company.

## Which to Prepare for First

If you are targeting both companies, **prioritize Zoho's question list first**. Here’s why:

1.  **Builds a Strong Foundation:** Zoho's higher ratio of Easy problems helps solidify your understanding of core topics and basic patterns without the initial pressure of high complexity. This creates a stable base.
2.  **Efficient Progression:** The Zoho bank covers the same key topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) as TikTok. Mastering these through Zoho's problems means you are directly preparing for the core of TikTok's interview as well.
3.  **Scalable Difficulty:** After confidently solving Zoho's Easy and Medium problems, transitioning to TikTok's larger set of Medium and Hard problems becomes a more manageable step-up in difficulty, rather than an overwhelming leap.

Start with Zoho's Array and String problems, ensure you are comfortable with Hash Table applications, then tackle their Dynamic Programming questions. Once proficient, move to TikTok's question bank to stress-test your skills with more intricate variations and optimization challenges.
