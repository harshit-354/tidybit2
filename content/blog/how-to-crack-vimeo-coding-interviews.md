Vimeo’s coding interviews are designed to assess both your problem-solving skills and your ability to build scalable, efficient systems. The process typically involves a mix of algorithmic questions and system design, focusing heavily on practical engineering challenges relevant to a video streaming platform. Understanding the specific patterns they favor is the fastest way to prepare effectively.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on recent data, Vimeo’s question distribution is revealing: 0% Easy, 83% Medium, and 17% Hard. This breakdown tells you two critical things. First, you must be exceptionally comfortable with Medium-level problems; these form the core of their technical screening. Second, the presence of Hard questions, while less frequent, means they are used to differentiate top candidates, especially for senior roles. You cannot afford to be shaky on fundamentals. The focus is not on trick questions but on applying well-known algorithms and data structures to complex, multi-step problems.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics are Array, Design, Bit Manipulation, Trie, and Depth-First Search. Here’s how to prioritize them.

- **Array:** Expect problems involving in-place manipulation, sliding windows, or prefix sums. Master traversals and two-pointer techniques.
- **Design:** This is critical. Be ready for both low-level object-oriented design (e.g., a video player) and high-level system design (e.g., a recommendation system).
- **Bit Manipulation:** A niche but recurring topic. You must know common operations like XOR, bit masking, and checking/setting bits.
- **Trie:** A specialized data structure often used for problems involving prefixes, like autocomplete or search. Know insertion, search, and prefix search by heart.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Essential for tree/graph traversal and backtracking problems. Understand both recursive and iterative implementations.

The most important pattern to master is **DFS on a Trie**, as it combines two of their top topics. It's commonly used for problems like "Word Search II" or implementing an autocomplete system. Here is the core pattern for searching all words with a given prefix in a Trie:

<div class="code-group">

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for ch in word:
            if ch not in node.children:
                node.children[ch] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[ch]
        node.is_word = True

    def search_with_prefix(self, prefix):
        # Find the node for the prefix
        node = self.root
        for ch in prefix:
            if ch not in node.children:
                return []
            node = node.children[ch]

        # DFS to collect all words from this node
        results = []
        self._dfs(node, prefix, results)
        return results

    def _dfs(self, node, path, results):
        if node.is_word:
            results.append(path)
        for ch, child_node in node.children.items():
            self._dfs(child_node, path + ch, results)
```

```javascript
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isWord = false;
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const ch of word) {
      if (!node.children.has(ch)) {
        node.children.set(ch, new TrieNode());
      }
      node = node.children.get(ch);
    }
    node.isWord = true;
  }

  searchWithPrefix(prefix) {
    // Find the node for the prefix
    let node = this.root;
    for (const ch of prefix) {
      if (!node.children.has(ch)) {
        return [];
      }
      node = node.children.get(ch);
    }

    // DFS to collect all words from this node
    const results = [];
    this._dfs(node, prefix, results);
    return results;
  }

  _dfs(node, path, results) {
    if (node.isWord) {
      results.push(path);
    }
    for (const [ch, childNode] of node.children) {
      this._dfs(childNode, path + ch, results);
    }
  }
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
    boolean isWord = false;
}

class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            node.children.putIfAbsent(ch, new TrieNode());
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        node.isWord = true;
    }

    public List<String> searchWithPrefix(String prefix) {
        // Find the node for the prefix
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            if (!node.children.containsKey(ch)) {
                return new ArrayList<>();
            }
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }

        // DFS to collect all words from this node
        List<String> results = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(node, prefix, results);
        return results;
    }

    private void dfs(TrieNode node, String path, List<String> results) {
        if (node.isWord) {
            results.add(path);
        }
        for (Map.Entry<Character, TrieNode> entry : node.children.entrySet()) {
            dfs(entry.getValue(), path + entry.getKey(), results);
        }
    }
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Grind Medium problems on the core topics: Array, DFS, and Bit Manipulation. Solve at least 15-20 problems per topic. Use platforms like TidyBit to filter by company and difficulty. For Design, start reading engineering blogs about video streaming architectures.

**Weeks 3-4: Integration and Depth.** Focus on problems that combine topics, like DFS on a Trie or arrays with bit manipulation. Solve 2-3 Hard problems per week to build stamina. Dedicate time to object-oriented design; practice outlining classes, relationships, and key methods for systems like a playlist manager.

**Weeks 5-6: Mock Interviews and Review.** Simulate the real interview environment. Do at least 5-7 mock interviews, focusing on explaining your thought process clearly. Re-solve all previously attempted Vimeo-tagged problems. In the final days, review system design fundamentals: CDNs, caching strategies, and data sharding.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly.** For every problem, start by restating it, asking clarifying questions, and then verbally walking through your approach before writing code. Interviewers evaluate your collaboration skills.
2.  **Optimize Incrementally.** First, state a brute-force solution and its complexity. Then, systematically optimize it. This demonstrates structured problem-solving.
3.  **Practice Design on a Whiteboard.** System design questions are diagram-heavy. Practice sketching boxes, arrows, and labeling components while talking. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs (e.g., consistency vs. availability).
4.  **Don't Neglect Bit Manipulation.** Because it's a known Vimeo topic, ensure you can perform basic operations without hesitation. A quick refresher on masks and XOR can save you in an interview.
5.  **Test Your Code.** Always run through a small test case with your code, either mentally or by writing it out. Point out edge cases (empty input, large values) and how your solution handles them.

Success in a Vimeo interview comes from targeted, consistent practice on their preferred problem domains and demonstrating clear, scalable engineering thinking.
