When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and expectations of each employer is crucial. PhonePe and ServiceNow, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, present distinct interview profiles in terms of volume, difficulty, and focus. A targeted preparation strategy, based on their historical question data, can significantly increase your efficiency and chances of success.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a clear difference in both the number of questions and their difficulty distribution.

**PhonePe** has a larger known question pool of **102 questions**. The difficulty breakdown is heavily weighted towards medium and hard problems: 63 Medium (M63) and 36 Hard (H36), with only 3 Easy (E3). This indicates that PhonePe's technical interviews are notoriously challenging, designed to rigorously test a candidate's problem-solving depth, optimization skills, and ability to handle complex scenarios under pressure. You should expect to encounter multi-layered problems that may combine several concepts.

**ServiceNow**, in contrast, has a smaller pool of **78 questions**. Its difficulty distribution is markedly different: 58 Medium (M58), 12 Hard (H12), and 8 Easy (E8). While still challenging, this profile suggests a stronger emphasis on foundational competency and clean implementation. The presence of more Easy questions and fewer Hard ones implies the interview may start with simpler warm-ups but will certainly progress to solid medium-difficulty problems that test core data structure and algorithm knowledge.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies prioritize a core set of fundamental topics, but with subtle shifts in emphasis that should guide your study focus.

The top overlapping topics are **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. Mastery of these is non-negotiable for either company.

- **Arrays** are the bedrock for most problems. Expect questions on traversal, two-pointer techniques, sliding windows, and prefix sums.
- **Hash Tables** are critical for efficient lookups and frequency counting. They are often the key to optimizing a brute-force solution.
- **Dynamic Programming** questions test your ability to break down problems into overlapping subproblems. For PhonePe's harder set, DP problems can be particularly complex.

The key divergence lies in their secondary focuses:

- **PhonePe** explicitly lists **Sorting** as a top topic. This goes beyond simple `sort()` calls; expect questions on custom comparators, leveraging sorted order for optimal solutions (like two-pointer on sorted arrays), and advanced sorting patterns (e.g., cyclic sort).
- **ServiceNow** highlights **String** manipulation as a primary area. You must be adept with palindromes, subsequences, anagrams, encoding/decoding, and string parsing algorithms.

```python
# Example: A problem combining Hash Table and String (common for ServiceNow)
def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = {}
    for s in strs:
        sorted_s = ''.join(sorted(s))  # Key insight: sorted string as signature
        anagram_map.setdefault(sorted_s, []).append(s)
    return list(anagram_map.values())

# Example: A problem combining Sorting and Array (common for PhonePe)
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sorting is the crucial first step
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged
```

```javascript
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table and String (common for ServiceNow)
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const s of strs) {
    const key = [...s].sort().join("");
    if (!map.has(key)) map.set(key, []);
    map.get(key).push(s);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}

// Example: A problem combining Sorting and Array (common for PhonePe)
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}
```

```java
// Example: A problem combining Hash Table and String (common for ServiceNow)
public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
    Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (String s : strs) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        String key = new String(chars);
        map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
        map.get(key).add(s);
    }
    return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
}

// Example: A problem combining Sorting and Array (common for PhonePe)
public int[][] mergeIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] = Math.max(merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

The strategic choice depends on your timeline and interview schedule.

**Prepare for ServiceNow first if:** You are interviewing with both, or you are earlier in your interview preparation cycle. The slightly lower volume and reduced proportion of hard questions make it an excellent target for building confidence. Solidifying the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) against ServiceNow's profile will create a strong foundation. This foundation is entirely transferable, and the act of tackling their medium-difficulty questions will directly benefit your PhonePe prep.

**Prepare for PhonePe first if:** Your interview with PhonePe is imminent, or you want to tackle the most challenging material upfront. Succeeding in PhonePe's interview requires deep mastery and exposure to complex problem variations. If you can solve a significant portion of PhonePe's medium and hard problems, transitioning to ServiceNow's question set will feel comparatively less daunting. However, do not neglect String problems, as they are less emphasized in PhonePe's listed top topics but are still fair game.

Ultimately, the significant overlap in core topics means preparation for one company substantially benefits the other. The difference is one of depth and specific emphasis: **PhonePe demands greater depth on advanced algorithmic patterns (especially Sorting and DP), while ServiceNow requires broad, solid proficiency with a particular eye for String manipulation.**
