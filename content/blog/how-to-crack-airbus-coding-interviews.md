Airbus coding interviews focus on practical problem-solving skills that mirror real-world aerospace engineering challenges. While the company is known for its complex aircraft systems, their technical screening tends to prioritize clean, efficient code over obscure computer science theory. You'll typically encounter a mix of online assessments and live coding interviews, where clarity of thought and communication are as important as the solution itself.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

The data shows a clear pattern: **0% Hard, 50% Medium, 50% Easy**. This is a critical insight. Airbus is not trying to filter candidates with impossible brain-teasers. Instead, they assess your foundational coding proficiency, attention to detail, and ability to handle moderately complex logic under pressure.

The absence of "Hard" problems means you should prioritize **mastery over breadth**. A perfect, well-explained solution to an Easy or Medium problem is far more valuable than a messy, partial solution to a Hard one. The 50/50 split indicates you must be flawless on fundamentals—the two Easy questions are likely elimination rounds—while the Medium questions determine your final ranking. Your goal is to solve all four questions correctly, with optimal time and space complexity for the Medium ones.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The data reveals three non-negotiable areas: **Array (most frequent), Hash Table, and Prefix Sum**. These topics are deeply interconnected and form the core of data manipulation and optimization problems.

**Array:** Expect questions involving traversal, in-place modification, and subarray calculations. Master two-pointer techniques and sliding windows.

**Hash Table:** The go-to tool for achieving O(1) lookups to optimize Array searches. It's essential for problems involving pairs, duplicates, or frequency counting.

**Prefix Sum:** This is the most important algorithmic pattern for Airbus. It transforms O(n²) subarray sum calculations into O(n) by pre-computing cumulative sums. This pattern is crucial for optimizing performance in data-stream-like scenarios, which is highly relevant to sensor or telemetry data processing in aerospace.

The quintessential Airbus problem combines these: _"Find a subarray with a target sum."_ A brute-force solution checks every subarray (O(n²)). A Hash Table combined with Prefix Sum solves it in O(n). Here is the implementation:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, target):
    prefix_sum = 0
    sum_index_map = {0: -1}  # Map prefix sum to its index

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        prefix_sum += num
        # Check if (prefix_sum - target) exists
        if prefix_sum - target in sum_index_map:
            return [sum_index_map[prefix_sum - target] + 1, i]
        sum_index_map[prefix_sum] = i
    return []  # No subarray found
```

```javascript
function subarraySum(nums, target) {
  let prefixSum = 0;
  const sumIndexMap = new Map();
  sumIndexMap.set(0, -1);

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    prefixSum += nums[i];
    const needed = prefixSum - target;
    if (sumIndexMap.has(needed)) {
      return [sumIndexMap.get(needed) + 1, i];
    }
    sumIndexMap.set(prefixSum, i);
  }
  return []; // No subarray found
}
```

```java
public int[] subarraySum(int[] nums, int target) {
    int prefixSum = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> sumIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
    sumIndexMap.put(0, -1);

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
        int needed = prefixSum - target;
        if (sumIndexMap.containsKey(needed)) {
            return new int[]{sumIndexMap.get(needed) + 1, i};
        }
        sumIndexMap.put(prefixSum, i);
    }
    return new int[]{}; // No subarray found
}
```

</div>

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Study Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation.** Drill Easy problems on Arrays and Hash Tables. Solve at least 30 problems. Focus on writing bug-free code on the first try. Practice explaining your logic out loud as you code.

**Weeks 3-4: Core Patterns.** Deep dive into Prefix Sum and its variants. Solve 15-20 Medium problems that combine Arrays with Hash Tables. Master the subarray sum pattern shown above. Learn to identify when a problem can be transformed into a "find a prefix sum difference" challenge.

**Weeks 5-6: Integration and Mock Interviews.** Simulate the actual interview format. Use a timer and solve two Easy and two Medium problems in a 60-75 minute session. Prioritize Airbus-specific or similar company-tagged questions. Record yourself to review communication clarity.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Before You Code.** State the brute-force approach first, then propose the optimization (e.g., "We can improve this from O(n²) to O(n) using a Hash Table to store prefix sums"). This demonstrates structured problem-solving.
2.  **Test with Edge Cases.** Airbus engineering values robustness. Always test your code with empty arrays, negative numbers, large values, and the case where the subarray starts at index 0.
3.  **Use Meaningful Variable Names.** Avoid `i`, `j`, `map`. Use `prefixSum`, `sumIndexMap`, `currentSum`. This makes your code self-documenting and shows professionalism.
4.  **Practice Space-Time Complexity Analysis.** Be prepared to justify your choices. For the Prefix Sum + Hash Table solution, articulate: "This uses O(n) extra space for the hash map in the worst case to achieve O(n) time complexity."

The Airbus interview is a test of precision and practical skill. Solidify your grasp of arrays, hash tables, and the prefix sum pattern, and you'll be well-equipped to deliver the reliable, efficient solutions they look for.
