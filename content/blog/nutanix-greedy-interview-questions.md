Greedy algorithms appear in roughly 13% of Nutanix’s technical interview questions (9 out of 68 total). This frequency is significant—it means you are highly likely to encounter at least one greedy problem during your interview loop. For a company like Nutanix, which builds distributed cloud infrastructure and hyper-converged systems, greedy algorithms are practical. They model real-time resource allocation, scheduling tasks across nodes, or optimizing network paths—problems where making the locally optimal choice at each step often leads to a globally efficient solution for the entire system. Mastering these questions demonstrates you can think about immediate efficiency and scalability, a mindset valued in systems and infrastructure roles.

## What to Expect — types of problems

Nutanix’s greedy questions typically fall into a few predictable categories. You should be ready to recognize and apply the standard patterns.

**Interval Scheduling & Merging:** A classic. Given a set of intervals (meetings, jobs, events), you might be asked to find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals, the minimum number of rooms/resources needed, or to merge overlapping intervals. This tests your ability to sort and traverse data efficiently.

**Assignment & Partitioning:** Problems where you need to assign resources or split a set into fair or optimal groups. Examples include assigning tasks to workers to minimize maximum load, or dividing an array into contiguous segments under a cost constraint.

**"Greedy Choice" on Sorted Data:** Many problems become straightforward once you sort the input. The greedy choice is often the "smallest" or "largest" element that meets a condition. Think of problems like minimum number of arrows to burst balloons, or reorganizing strings.

The key is to identify that a greedy approach is valid. Ask yourself: if I make this best local choice, will it always contribute to an optimal global solution? If you can prove it (often by exchange argument or showing optimal substructure), you’re on the right track.

## How to Prepare — study tips with one code example

First, **memorize the patterns, not the problems.** Understand why sorting is usually the first step. Practice proving the greedy choice property for each major category.

Second, **start with the foundational LeetCode problems.** Questions like "Merge Intervals," "Task Scheduler," or "Gas Station" are the building blocks. Nutanix problems are often direct variants.

Third, **write clean, production-ready code.** Even in an interview, comment on time and space complexity. Nutanix engineers value code that is both correct and clear.

Consider the classic "Meeting Rooms II" problem: given an array of meeting time intervals, find the minimum number of conference rooms required. The greedy insight is to sort all start and end times separately and traverse them, counting how many meetings are concurrently active.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    starts = sorted(i[0] for i in intervals)
    ends = sorted(i[1] for i in intervals)

    rooms_needed = 0
    max_rooms = 0
    s_ptr, e_ptr = 0, 0

    while s_ptr < len(intervals):
        if starts[s_ptr] < ends[e_ptr]:
            rooms_needed += 1
            s_ptr += 1
            max_rooms = max(max_rooms, rooms_needed)
        else:
            rooms_needed -= 1
            e_ptr += 1
    return max_rooms
```

```javascript
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return 0;

  const starts = intervals.map((i) => i[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const ends = intervals.map((i) => i[1]).sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let roomsNeeded = 0;
  let maxRooms = 0;
  let sPtr = 0,
    ePtr = 0;

  while (sPtr < intervals.length) {
    if (starts[sPtr] < ends[ePtr]) {
      roomsNeeded++;
      sPtr++;
      maxRooms = Math.max(maxRooms, roomsNeeded);
    } else {
      roomsNeeded--;
      ePtr++;
    }
  }
  return maxRooms;
}
```

```java
public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
    if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;

    int[] starts = new int[intervals.length];
    int[] ends = new int[intervals.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        starts[i] = intervals[i][0];
        ends[i] = intervals[i][1];
    }
    Arrays.sort(starts);
    Arrays.sort(ends);

    int roomsNeeded = 0;
    int maxRooms = 0;
    int sPtr = 0, ePtr = 0;

    while (sPtr < intervals.length) {
        if (starts[sPtr] < ends[ePtr]) {
            roomsNeeded++;
            sPtr++;
            maxRooms = Math.max(maxRooms, roomsNeeded);
        } else {
            roomsNeeded--;
            ePtr++;
        }
    }
    return maxRooms;
}
```

## Recommended Practice Order

1.  **Fundamentals:** Merge Intervals, Non-overlapping Intervals, Meeting Rooms I & II.
2.  **Classic Greedy:** Task Scheduler, Gas Station, Partition Labels.
3.  **Tricky Application:** Candy, Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons.
4.  **Nutanix-Specific:** Finally, tackle the tagged company questions on platforms like TidyBit to see how these patterns are applied in their interviews.

Consistency is key. Solve 1-2 greedy problems daily in the two weeks leading to your interview.
