When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and difficulty distribution of their question banks can significantly streamline your preparation. Walmart Labs and eBay both assess core algorithmic skills, but their interview question profiles reveal distinct patterns in volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis that candidates should note.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of the question banks. Walmart Labs, with **152 questions** cataloged, presents a broader and deeper pool of potential problems. Its difficulty distribution (E22/M105/H25) shows a pronounced emphasis on **Medium-level questions**, which constitute about 69% of its total. This suggests their interviews are heavily geared toward problems that require a solid grasp of core data structures and algorithms, with some implementation complexity or optimization needed. The 25 Hard questions indicate you must also be prepared for at least one highly challenging problem that tests advanced techniques or optimal solutions.

In contrast, eBay's catalog is more focused, with **60 questions** total. Its distribution (E12/M38/H10) also skews toward Medium difficulty, which makes up roughly 63% of its questions. The smaller overall volume and the lower count of Hard questions suggest that while the interview is still rigorous, the scope of deeply complex algorithmic challenges might be slightly narrower. The preparation load for eBay's question bank is inherently lighter.

**Key Takeaway:** Prepare for a more extensive and slightly more challenging question set at Walmart Labs. For eBay, depth on core Medium problems is critical.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test fundamental data structures. The shared top topics are **Array, String, and Hash Table**. This means mastery over these areas is non-negotiable for interviews at either company.

- **Array/String Problems:** Expect questions involving two-pointers, sliding windows, and string manipulation.
- **Hash Table Problems:** Frequently used for efficient lookups to optimize solutions, often in combination with the above.

The primary divergence lies in the next layer of topics.

- **Walmart Labs** explicitly lists **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a key topic. Given their higher number of Hard questions, it's very likely DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, unique paths) appear in their challenging set.
- **eBay** lists **Sorting** as a key topic instead. This points to a focus on problems where sorting is a crucial preprocessing step (e.g., merging intervals, finding anagrams, or two-sum variations) or where you must implement/customize a sort.

```python
# Example of a Sorting-Centric Problem (eBay focus): Merge Intervals
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    return merged

# Example of a DP Problem (Walmart Labs focus): Coin Change
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

```javascript
// Example of a Sorting-Centric Problem (eBay focus): Merge Intervals
function merge(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  const merged = [];
  for (let interval of intervals) {
    if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(merged[merged.length - 1][1], interval[1]);
    }
  }
  return merged;
}

// Example of a DP Problem (Walmart Labs focus): Coin Change
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (const coin of coins) {
    for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

```java
// Example of a Sorting-Centric Problem (eBay focus): Merge Intervals
public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int[] interval : intervals) {
        if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.add(interval);
        } else {
            merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
}

// Example of a DP Problem (Walmart Labs focus): Coin Change
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be dictated by the interview timeline and the efficient transfer of skills.

**Prepare for eBay first if:** Your eBay interview is sooner, or you want to build confidence with a strong foundation. Mastering eBay's core list will solidify your skills in Array, String, Hash Table, and Sorting—all of which are also essential for Walmart Labs. You can then layer on the additional Dynamic Programming and more complex problems needed for Walmart.

**Prepare for Walmart Labs first if:** Your Walmart interview is imminent, or you want to tackle the broader challenge upfront. Succeeding in Walmart Labs' preparation inherently covers almost all of eBay's required technical scope. The intense practice with Medium and Hard problems, especially DP, will make eBay's question bank feel like a focused subset. The risk is that the initial learning curve is steeper.

**Strategic Approach:** Start with the shared **Array, String, and Hash Table** fundamentals. Then, branch based on your next interview:

- For **eBay**, integrate deep **Sorting** practice.
- For **Walmart Labs**, integrate **Dynamic Programming** and tackle more Hard problems.

Ultimately, preparing for Walmart Labs is the more comprehensive task, but the core skills are highly transferable to eBay.
