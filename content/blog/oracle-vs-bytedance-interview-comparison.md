When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the differences in their question banks can significantly impact your study strategy. Oracle and ByteDance (now often referred to as Douyin Group internationally) represent two distinct types of tech giants: a long-established enterprise software leader and a rapidly expanding social media and technology conglomerate. While both assess core computer science fundamentals, the scale and focus of their known interview questions differ markedly, as seen in their LeetCode company tags. This comparison breaks down the volume, difficulty, and topic emphasis to help you prioritize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer number of associated practice questions. Oracle's tag lists **340 questions**, dwarfing ByteDance's **64 questions**. This volume suggests Oracle has a more extensive, possibly more predictable, history of questions circulating in interview prep communities, often associated with its long tenure and large number of hires.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring bars or problem-selection tendencies:

- **Oracle (E70/M205/H65):** The majority (205) are Medium difficulty. With 65 Hard questions, Oracle's set includes a significant challenge component, likely for specific roles or later interview rounds.
- **ByteDance (E6/M49/H9):** The focus is overwhelmingly on Medium-difficulty problems (49 out of 64). It has very few Easy (6) and Hard (9) questions in its known set. This could indicate a streamlined process that heavily targets complex problem-solving within a 45-minute interview window, without the extreme outliers.

**Key Takeaway:** Oracle's list is broader and contains more hard problems, potentially requiring wider coverage and depth. ByteDance's list, while smaller, is intensely focused on Medium problems, demanding high proficiency under time pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Despite the volume difference, both companies test nearly identical core data structures and algorithms. The listed top topics are the same: **Array, String, Hash Table, and Dynamic Programming**.

This overlap is not surprising—these are foundational to algorithmic interviews. However, the context of their application may differ:

- **Array/String/Hash Table:** These are universal. For ByteDance, problems involving strings and arrays might relate to real-time text processing, user feeds, or content matching. For Oracle, they might relate to data processing, query optimization, or system utilities.
- **Dynamic Programming:** A key topic for both, indicating they value candidates who can optimize recursive problems and handle complex state management.

The main implication is that a strong foundation in these four areas is non-negotiable for either company. Mastering common patterns for these topics will serve you well in both interview loops.

# Example: A common DP pattern (Climbing Stairs)
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: A common DP pattern (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: A common DP pattern (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority should be guided by your target role and timeline.

**Prepare for Oracle first if:** You are early in your interview prep cycle or want to build a broad, deep foundation. Tackling Oracle's 340-question list, with its spread of difficulties, will force you to cover a wide range of problems and concepts. Success here means you will have seen most patterns that could appear in a ByteDance interview, making the subsequent study more about refinement and speed.

**Prepare for ByteDance first if:** You are short on time or have already solidified your core knowledge. The concentrated set of 64 Medium-difficulty problems is a highly focused target. You can drill into these specific questions and similar patterns to maximize your performance for that specific interview loop. The risk is a narrower preparation scope.

A pragmatic hybrid approach is to **master the shared core topics (Array, String, Hash Table, DP) first**, using high-frequency problems from any source. Then, if targeting both companies, use Oracle's list for breadth and depth training, and use ByteDance's list for final, targeted practice and pattern recognition specific to their style.
