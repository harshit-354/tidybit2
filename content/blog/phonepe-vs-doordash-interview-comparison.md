When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific patterns and emphasis of each company's question bank can dramatically increase your efficiency. PhonePe and DoorDash, while both requiring strong algorithmic skills, show distinct profiles in their frequently asked interview questions. This comparison breaks down the volume, difficulty, and core topics for each, providing a targeted roadmap for your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw data shows a clear difference in the size and composition of each company's known question pool.

**PhonePe** has a larger total repository with **102 questions**. Its difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards foundational and intermediate problems: **63 Medium** questions, **36 Hard** questions, and a significant number of **Easy** questions at 3. This suggests PhonePe's interview process may use easier questions for initial screening or phone screens, but candidates must be prepared for a broad range of Medium problems that test core concepts under time pressure.

**DoorDash** has a slightly smaller known pool of **87 questions**. Its distribution is more concentrated on the middle tier: **51 Medium** questions, **30 Hard** questions, and **6 Easy** questions. The higher count of Easy questions compared to PhonePe might indicate a more consistent use of simpler problems in early rounds. The focus, however, is squarely on Medium and Hard challenges that often model real-world logistics and system design scenarios translated into data structures.

**Key Takeaway:** Both require deep Medium-problem proficiency. PhonePe's larger pool suggests slightly more variety, while DoorDash's structure indicates a steady ramp in difficulty.

## Topic Overlap

Analyzing the top topics reveals a shared foundation but with a crucial divergence in advanced topics.

**Core Overlap (Array & Hash Table):** Both companies prioritize **Array** and **Hash Table** problems. This is universal. You must master techniques like two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums for arrays, and efficient lookups/mappings with hash tables. These are the workhorses for solving optimization and data retrieval problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two-pointer with Hash Table (common pattern)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
// Example: Two-pointer with Hash Table (common pattern)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two-pointer with Hash Table (common pattern)
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

**Divergence in Specialization:**

- **PhonePe** strongly emphasizes **Dynamic Programming** and **Sorting**. DP problems test optimal substructure and state transition, common in financial and optimization logic. Sorting mastery is key for preprocessing and greedy algorithms.
- **DoorDash** highlights **String** manipulation and **Depth-First Search**. String problems relate to parsing addresses, orders, or user data. DFS is critical for traversing graphs, hierarchies (like menus or locations), and backtracking through possible delivery routes or states.

This divergence points to their business domains: PhonePe (fintech) leans into optimization and calculation (DP), while DoorDash (logistics) leans into text processing and graph traversal.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your choice depends on your interview timeline and strengths.

**Start with PhonePe if:** Your fundamentals in arrays and hash tables are solid, and you want to tackle a wider, slightly more varied problem set. The significant focus on **Dynamic Programming** is a major commitment; if DP is a weakness, you will need substantial dedicated practice. Preparing for PhonePe first builds a very strong algorithmic core that is transferable.

**Start with DoorDash if:** You are stronger with graph/tree traversal (DFS) and string algorithms, or you have interviews scheduled sooner. The topic list is slightly more focused, allowing you to drill deeply into arrays, hash tables, strings, and DFS. The real-world context of problems may also be more intuitive.

**General Strategy:** Regardless of order, begin with the **shared foundation: Array and Hash Table** problems. Achieve fluency here. Then, branch into each company's specialty: DP/Sorting for PhonePe, and String/DFS for DoorDash. This approach ensures you build the most transferable skills first.
