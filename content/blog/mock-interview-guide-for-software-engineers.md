You can solve 300 LeetCode problems and still bomb your first real interview. The gap between solo practice and performing under pressure is enormous. Mock interviews bridge that gap by training the interpersonal and communication skills that solo practice cannot simulate.

## Why They Matter

In a real interview, you are not just solving a problem. You are explaining your thought process, managing time, handling hints, and staying composed when stuck. Mock interviews expose weaknesses you cannot see alone: coding in silence, rushing into code, freezing under pressure. For example, you might know how to implement a binary search tree, but can you explain your insertion logic clearly while writing bug-free code under a 30-minute timer? Mock interviews simulate this exact pressure.

## Free Options

**Peer practice.** Find a study partner and take turns interviewing each other. The most accessible option. You also learn from the interviewer side. Find partners on LeetCode Discuss, Discord interview prep communities, or through alumni groups.

**Pramp (free tier on Exponent).** Pairs you with another candidate for 60-minute mutual sessions, 30 minutes each way. Curated problems, shared coding environment.

**Friends and colleagues.** Engineers who have been through the process recently can give feedback grounded in real experience.

## Paid Options

**Interviewing.io.** Anonymous mocks with engineers from top companies. Detailed feedback and session recordings. The closest simulation to a real FAANG interview.

**Private coaching.** Targeted feedback from someone who has conducted interviews at your target company. Expensive, but high ROI for specific companies.

For most candidates, combine free peer practice (volume) with occasional paid sessions (calibrated feedback).

## Structuring a Mock Session

**Setup (5 min).** Interviewer selects a problem and has the solution ready. Agree on format. Set a timer. The problem should be appropriate for the target company's difficulty level (e.g., Medium for most tech screens, Hard for onsite rounds).

**Interview (45 min).** The candidate should:

- Clarify the problem (2-3 min)
- Discuss approach and complexity (5 min)
- Code while explaining (25-30 min)
- Test with examples and edge cases (5-7 min)

The interviewer gives hints when the candidate is truly stuck, asks follow-up questions, and notes communication quality.

**Feedback (10 min).** Cover: Was the approach clear before coding? Was code clean? Edge cases considered? Time management? Would this be a hire signal? Be honest -- vague feedback helps no one. Use a structured feedback template: Communication (1-5), Problem Solving (1-5), Coding (1-5), and specific action items.

## What to Practice

Do not use mocks to learn new patterns. Use them to practice patterns you already know under realistic conditions.

**Communication.** Think out loud. Silence beyond 15-20 seconds makes interviewers uncomfortable. Explain what you are doing and why. Practice narrating your thought process for common algorithms.

# Example: Explaining Two Sum while coding

    """

    seen = {}  # Map value -> index

        if complement in seen:
            # Explain: "We found the pair, return the indices."
            return [seen[complement], i]
        # Explain: "Store the current number and move on."
        seen[num] = i
    return []  # No solution found
```

```javascript
// Example: Explaining Two Sum while coding
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  /**
   * Approach: Use a hash map to store numbers we've seen and their indices.
   * For each number, calculate the complement (target - num).
   * If the complement is in the map, we found a pair.
   * Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
   */
  const seen = new Map(); // Map value -> index
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    // Explain: "Check if we've already seen the needed complement."
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    // Explain: "Store the current number and move on."
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return []; // No solution found
}
```

```java

        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); // Map value -> index

                return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
            }
            // Explain: "Store the current number and move on."
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }
}
```

**Time management.** Practice the split: 5 min clarify, 5 min plan, 25 min code, 10 min test. If you cannot finish in 25 minutes, simplify your approach. For a complex problem like "Merge k Sorted Lists," you might need to decide quickly between a brute-force merge (O(nk)) and a heap-optimized approach (O(n log k)).

**Handling hints.** Acknowledge, integrate, do not ignore or over-rely on them. For example, if you're stuck on a graph traversal problem and the interviewer hints, "Think about BFS vs DFS for shortest path," you should explicitly acknowledge: "That's a good point. Since we need the shortest transformation sequence, BFS is more appropriate than DFS here."

**Edge case testing.** Walk through edge cases after coding. Make it non-negotiable. Develop a mental checklist: empty input, single element, large values, negative numbers, duplicates, sorted vs. unsorted input.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Testing edge cases for Binary Search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Edge Cases to Verbally Walk Through:
# 1. Empty array: binary_search([], 5) -> returns -1 correctly.
# 2. Single element, found: binary_search([5], 5) -> returns 0.
# 3. Single element, not found: binary_search([3], 5) -> returns -1.
# 4. Target at boundaries: binary_search([1,2,3,4,5], 1) -> returns 0.
# 5. Target not present, should be in middle: binary_search([1,3,5], 2) -> returns -1.
# 6. Large array (mention performance O(log n)).
```

```javascript
// Example: Testing edge cases for Binary Search
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {

## Frequency and Timing

Start 3-4 weeks before your first real interview.

- Weeks 1-2: One mock per week. Get comfortable with the format. Focus on communication fundamentals.
- Weeks 3-4: Two mocks per week. Focus on consistency. Simulate back-to-back onsite rounds.
- Final week: One mock, then rest. The last mock should be with a problem you've never seen, but of known difficulty.

Peer sessions where you alternate roles count as two mocks. Being the interviewer trains you to recognize optimal solutions and common pitfalls, which makes you a better candidate.

## Common Mistakes

**Not treating it seriously.** Simulate real conditions -- timer, no phone, no extra tabs. Use a shared editor like CoderPad or CodePen. Dress professionally if it helps your mindset.

**Only easy problems.** Use medium-hard problems to stress-test your process. For example, practice dynamic programming problems like "Longest Increasing Subsequence" or graph problems like "Course Schedule" where both the algorithm and implementation need to be clear.

    2. Add all nodes with indegree 0 to a queue.
    3. Process nodes, reduce indegree of neighbors.
    4. If we process all nodes, no cycle -> can finish.

**Skipping feedback.** The feedback session is the most valuable part. Take notes and review before the next session. Create a "Feedback Log" to track recurring issues (e.g., "Rush into coding without a plan," "Forget edge cases for empty input").

**Too many mocks.** More than three per week leads to burnout. Balance with solo practice. Your brain needs time to consolidate the feedback and patterns learned.

## Balancing Mock and Solo Practice

A balanced weekly schedule during active prep: 5 days solo practice (2-3 problems/day), 2 mock sessions, 1 rest day. Use the [TidyBit dashboard](/dashboard) to select problems -- company-specific for mocks, topic-based for solo. For a structured study plan, see [how to practice LeetCode effectively](/blog/how-to-practice-leetcode-effectively).

### Sample Weekly Schedule

- **Monday:** Solo practice - Focus on one topic (e.g., Trees). Solve 2 problems, review patterns.
- **Tuesday:** Mock interview - Simulate a Google phone screen with a Medium tree problem.
- **Wednesday:** Solo practice - Review mock feedback, drill weaknesses (e.g., recursion).
- **Thursday:** Solo practice - New topic (e.g., Dynamic Programming). Solve 2 problems.
- **Friday:** Mock interview - Simulate an Amazon onsite with a Hard DP problem.
- **Saturday:** Solo practice - Mixed review of past problems, focus on speed.
- **Sunday:** Rest - No coding. Mental recovery.

The candidates who succeed are not the smartest. They are the ones who practice algorithms, communication, and composure together. Mock interviews are the only way to train all three at once. By integrating consistent mock practice with targeted solo study, you build the muscle memory needed to perform when it counts.
