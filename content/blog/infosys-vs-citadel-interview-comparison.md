When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus and expectations of each company is crucial. Infosys and Citadel represent two distinct ends of the spectrum—a global IT services giant and a premier quantitative hedge fund. Their interview questions reflect their core business models: Infosys emphasizes foundational problem-solving for large-scale software services, while Citadel targets high-performance, optimized solutions for financial systems. A direct comparison of their question banks reveals clear strategic differences in volume, difficulty, and topical focus.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw numbers tell an immediate story. Infosys's catalog is significantly larger, with **158 questions** categorized as Easy (42), Medium (82), and Hard (34). This volume suggests a broader, more comprehensive screening process typical of large firms that hire at scale. The distribution is balanced, with a strong emphasis on Medium-difficulty problems, indicating a focus on solid, reliable algorithmic competency.

Citadel's list is more curated at **96 questions**, with a starkly different distribution: Easy (6), Medium (59), Hard (31). The near absence of Easy questions and the high proportion of Hard problems (over 32%) signals an expectation for exceptional technical skill. The interview is designed to be a rigorous filter for top-tier talent capable of handling complex, performance-critical challenges.

**Key Takeaway:** Infosys tests for consistent, broad competency; Citadel tests for high-caliber, elite problem-solving under pressure.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test core computer science fundamentals, but with different nuances.

- **Common Ground (Array, Dynamic Programming, String):** These form the essential toolkit. You will need mastery here for either company.

  ```python
  # Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
  def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
      if n <= 2:
          return n
      dp = [0] * (n + 1)
      dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
      for i in range(3, n + 1):
          dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
      return dp[n]
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
  function climbStairs(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
      dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
  }
  ```

  ```java
  // Example: A common DP problem (Climbing Stairs)
  public int climbStairs(int n) {
      if (n <= 2) return n;
      int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
      dp[1] = 1;
      dp[2] = 2;
      for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
          dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
      }
      return dp[n];
  }
  ```

- **Divergence:** The most telling difference is Citadel's explicit focus on **Hash Table**. This underscores their need for optimal lookups, data association, and efficient data structure usage—skills vital for low-latency trading systems. Infosys's inclusion of **Math** points toward a wider variety of logical and numerical problems common in general software development.

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation priority depends entirely on your target and career stage.

**Prepare for Infosys first if:** You are early in your interview preparation journey or targeting large-scale tech/services companies. The larger volume and wider difficulty range provide an excellent training ground. Solving the Infosys list will build a robust foundation in core algorithms and data structures. Mastering the Medium problems is particularly important here.

**Prepare for Citadel first if:** You are already comfortable with core algorithms and are aiming for top-tier, competitive roles in finance or tech (FAANG, hedge funds, HFT). The Citadel list is a high-intensity workout. Focus intensely on mastering Medium and Hard problems, with special attention to problems involving hash tables, system design principles, and highly optimized solutions. The low number of Easy questions means you should be ready to tackle complexity immediately.

**Strategic Approach:** A logical path is to use the Infosys question bank for **breadth and foundational strength**, then hone your skills with the Citadel list for **depth and performance-oriented thinking**. Regardless of the order, ensure you can not only solve the problems but also articulate your reasoning clearly and discuss time/space complexity trade-offs—a critical skill for both companies.
