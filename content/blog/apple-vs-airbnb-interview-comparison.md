When preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can significantly increase your chances of success. While both Apple and Airbnb are prestigious destinations for software engineers, their interview processes, as reflected in their question banks, have distinct characteristics. Apple's process is broad and deeply integrated with systems design, whereas Airbnb's is more concentrated on algorithmic problem-solving with a practical bent. This comparison breaks down the key differences in question volume, difficulty, and topic focus to help you strategize your preparation.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The most immediate difference is the sheer scale of the question pools. With **356 questions** cataloged, Apple's known problem set is substantially larger than Airbnb's **64 questions**. This volume suggests Apple's interviews draw from a wider, more established repository of problems, potentially increasing the variability of what you might encounter.

The difficulty distribution also reveals different hiring emphases:

- **Apple (E100/M206/H50):** The majority of questions are Medium (206), with a significant number of Easy (100) and a smaller, yet substantial, set of Hard (50) problems. This bell curve indicates a strong focus on core competency and problem-solving fundamentals, with Hard questions likely testing depth in specific domains or system-level thinking.
- **Airbnb (E11/M34/H19):** The distribution is more skewed toward challenging problems relative to its size. With 19 Hard questions out of 64, nearly 30% of Airbnb's catalog is at the Hard difficulty, compared to Apple's ~14%. This points to an interview process that aggressively tests complex algorithmic reasoning and optimal solution design, even with a smaller question pool.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test the foundational data structures and algorithms crucial for any software engineering role. The top four topics are identical, just in a slightly different order:

- **Apple:** Array, String, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming
- **Airbnb:** Array, Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming

This high overlap means core preparation is transferable. Mastering operations on **Arrays** and **Strings**, efficiently using **Hash Tables** for lookups, and understanding **Dynamic Programming** patterns are essential for both.

The key difference lies in context and integration. Apple's questions frequently intertwine algorithms with low-level or system-oriented considerations (e.g., memory management, concurrency). Airbnb's problems often have a practical, real-world flavor related to its business domain, such as parsing and validating booking data, designing reservation systems, or handling search filters.

```python
# Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for a two-sum style problem.
def find_pair(arr, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# This pattern is fundamental for both companies.
```

```javascript
// Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for a two-sum style problem.
function findPair(arr, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - arr[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(arr[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
// This pattern is fundamental for both companies.
```

```java
// Example: A common "Hash Table" pattern for a two-sum style problem.
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] findPair(int[] arr, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - arr[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(arr[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
// This pattern is fundamental for both companies.
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Airbnb**. Its smaller, more concentrated question set allows for efficient, targeted preparation. You can thoroughly cover the 64 questions, with particular attention to the high proportion of Hard problems. This builds strong algorithmic muscles. The practical nature of many Airbnb questions also helps you learn to map real-world scenarios to data structures.

After mastering Airbnb's core, transition to **Apple**. Use the broad foundation you've built to tackle Apple's larger volume. The expanded question set will test your adaptability and expose you to a wider range of problem variations. This is the time to integrate systems thinking and practice explaining how your algorithms interact with hardware or OS constraints, a hallmark of Apple interviews.

In short: use Airbnb's focused, challenging list to get algorithmically sharp. Then use Apple's extensive catalog to build breadth, stamina, and systems-level depth.
