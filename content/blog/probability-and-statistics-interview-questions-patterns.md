Probability and Statistics questions test your ability to model uncertainty, analyze data, and reason quantitatively. While less frequent than pure algorithm problems, they are a critical filter for roles in machine learning, data science, quantitative analysis, and general software engineering at top tech firms. A strong grasp here demonstrates analytical rigor and the ability to solve problems with incomplete information.

## Common Patterns

Mastering a few core patterns will let you tackle most interview questions.

### 1. Simulation with Random Number Generation

For complex probability problems where an analytical solution is non-trivial, you can often write a quick simulation to approximate the answer. This shows practical problem-solving skills.

<div class="code-group">

```python
import random

def simulate_dice_sum(target_sum, num_trials=100000):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_trials):
        if random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) == target_sum:
            count += 1
    return count / num_trials

# Approximate P(sum of two dice == 7)
print(simulate_dice_sum(7))  # ~0.166
```

```javascript
function simulateDiceSum(targetSum, numTrials = 100000) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numTrials; i++) {
    if (Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1 === targetSum) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count / numTrials;
}

console.log(simulateDiceSum(7)); // ~0.166
```

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Simulation {
    public static double simulateDiceSum(int targetSum, int numTrials) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < numTrials; i++) {
            if (rand.nextInt(6) + 1 + rand.nextInt(6) + 1 == targetSum) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return (double) count / numTrials;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(simulateDiceSum(7, 100000)); // ~0.166
    }
}
```

</div>

### 2. Combinatorics and Counting

Many problems reduce to counting favorable outcomes versus total possible outcomes. Key formulas include permutations, combinations, and the binomial distribution.

<div class="code-group">

```python
import math

# Probability of getting exactly k heads in n coin flips (fair coin)
def binomial_probability(n, k):
    total_outcomes = 2 ** n
    favorable = math.comb(n, k)  # n choose k
    return favorable / total_outcomes

print(binomial_probability(5, 2))  # P(exactly 2 heads in 5 flips)
```

```javascript
function combination(n, k) {
  let numerator = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    numerator *= n - i;
  }
  let denominator = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
    denominator *= i;
  }
  return numerator / denominator;
}

function binomialProbability(n, k) {
  const totalOutcomes = Math.pow(2, n);
  const favorable = combination(n, k);
  return favorable / totalOutcomes;
}

console.log(binomialProbability(5, 2));
```

```java
public class Combinatorics {
    public static long combination(int n, int k) {
        long res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res = res * (n - i) / (i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }

    public static double binomialProbability(int n, int k) {
        long totalOutcomes = (long) Math.pow(2, n);
        long favorable = combination(n, k);
        return (double) favorable / totalOutcomes;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(binomialProbability(5, 2));
    }
}
```

</div>

### 3. Expected Value Linearilty

The expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values, regardless of whether they are independent. This property simplifies complex problems.

**Example:** Expected number of coin flips to get two heads in a row. You can set up a state-based equation (E = expected flips from start): `E = 1 + 0.5*E + 0.5*(1 + 0.5*0 + 0.5*E)`. Solving gives E = 6.

### 4. Bayes' Theorem

Essential for conditional probability questions. Remember: `P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)`. Use it to update probabilities given new evidence.

## Difficulty Breakdown

The data shows a 100% concentration on **Medium** difficulty questions. This is telling. Easy questions are often too simplistic for screening (e.g., basic dice probabilities). Hard questions can be overly specialized or academic. Medium questions hit the sweet spot: they require structured thinking, a mix of concepts, and clear communication—exactly what interviewers assess. Expect problems like: "What's the expected number of people you need to ask to find someone who shares your birthday?" or "Given a biased coin, how do you generate a fair coin toss?"

## Which Companies Ask Probability and Statistics

These questions are particularly common at firms with strong quantitative, data-driven, or financial engineering cultures.

- **[Google](/company/google)**: For ML, data science, and general SWE roles, especially those involving large-scale systems or data analysis.
- **[Bloomberg](/company/bloomberg)**: Core for quantitative finance and data analyst positions.
- **[Microsoft](/company/microsoft)**: Common in data science, analytics, and roles for products with statistical components.
- **[Amazon](/company/amazon)**: Frequently asked for data scientist, applied scientist, and business intelligence roles.
- **[DE Shaw](/company/de-shaw)**: A staple in quantitative researcher and trader interviews, where rigorous probability is fundamental.

## Study Tips

1.  **Focus on Fundamentals, Not Memorization.** Understand _why_ formulas like Bayes' Theorem or linearity of expectation work. You'll be asked to derive or apply them in novel situations.
2.  **Practice "Word Problem" Translation.** The hardest part is often converting a story ("expected rounds in a game") into a mathematical model. Practice articulating your reasoning step-by-step.
3.  **Combine Simulation and Theory.** Use simulation to quickly check your analytical answer. In an interview, mentioning you could verify with code is a strong point.
4.  **Review Basic Distributions.** Be comfortable with the scenarios and properties of Uniform, Binomial, and Geometric distributions. Know their expected values.

Build fluency by applying these patterns to concrete problems.
