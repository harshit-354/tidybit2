When preparing for technical interviews, understanding company-specific patterns is crucial for efficient study. TikTok and Capital One represent two distinct ends of the tech interview spectrum: one is a high-growth social media giant with a notoriously rigorous process, and the other is a major financial institution undergoing a digital transformation. Their question banks on TidyBit reflect this difference clearly, making a targeted approach essential.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of questions is the most immediate difference. TikTok's list of **383 questions** dwarfs Capital One's **57**. This volume indicates a broader, more unpredictable question pool, which is typical for top-tier tech companies that constantly refresh their assessments.

The difficulty distribution further highlights their contrasting bars:

- **TikTok (E42/M260/H81):** The curve is heavily weighted toward Medium and Hard problems. With over **89%** of questions at these levels, TikTok expects candidates to solve complex algorithmic challenges under pressure. The high number of Hard problems suggests deep mastery of advanced data structures and optimization is required.
- **Capital One (E11/M36/H10):** The distribution is more balanced, leaning toward Medium difficulty. About **63%** of questions are Medium, with a smaller proportion of Hard problems. This points to an interview that tests solid foundational knowledge and practical problem-solving, often with a focus on logic and clean code, rather than extreme algorithmic optimization.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies emphasize core computer science fundamentals, which is excellent news for candidates. The significant overlap in top topics—**Array, String, and Hash Table**—means a strong foundation in these areas serves both interview processes.

- **TikTok** adds **Dynamic Programming (DP)** as a top topic. This is a critical differentiator. DP problems are classic high-difficulty questions that test a candidate's ability to handle optimization and state transition. Preparing for TikTok necessitates dedicated DP practice.
- **Capital One** lists **Math** as a primary topic instead. This often involves problems related to number properties, simulation, or basic arithmetic operations, which are common in financial and logical contexts.

Here is a typical problem that might appear in both lists, focusing on the overlapping Hash Table topic:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should be guided by your target roles and timeline.

**Prepare for Capital One first if:** You are early in your interview preparation cycle or targeting fintech/enterprise tech roles. The smaller, more foundational question set allows you to build confidence. Mastering the core topics (Array, String, Hash Table) and practicing common Medium-difficulty problems will create a solid base that is directly transferable to many companies, including TikTok.

**Prepare for TikTok first if:** You are aiming for top-tier software engineering roles at FAANG-level companies or have an interview scheduled. The extensive and difficult question bank demands a significant time investment. Succeeding here requires you to level up your skills to cover advanced patterns like Dynamic Programming. The depth required for TikTok will make Capital One's list feel like a focused subset, effectively covering it through osmosis.

In practice, a hybrid strategy is effective: solidify your fundamentals using a list like Capital One's, then expand into advanced topics and high-volume practice using a list like TikTok's to reach the highest tier of performance.
