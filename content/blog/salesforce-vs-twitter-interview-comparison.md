When preparing for technical interviews at major tech companies, understanding the specific focus areas and question patterns can dramatically increase your efficiency. Salesforce and Twitter (now X) represent two distinct types of tech giants: one is a leader in enterprise CRM and cloud software, while the other is a major social media and real-time information platform. This difference is reflected in their technical interview landscapes. A strategic analysis of question volume, difficulty, and topic frequency reveals clear preparation priorities.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The sheer volume of reported questions is the most immediate difference. Salesforce's list is significantly larger, with **189 questions** compared to Twitter's **53**. This suggests that Salesforce's question bank is more extensive, potentially drawing from a wider range of problems or having a longer history of collected data.

The difficulty distribution also tells a story:

- **Salesforce (E27/M113/H49):** The majority of questions are Medium (113), with a substantial number of Hard (49). This indicates a strong emphasis on problem-solving depth and algorithmic complexity.
- **Twitter (E8/M33/H12):** The distribution is also Medium-heavy (33), but with fewer Hard questions (12). The interview may slightly favor conceptual understanding and clean implementation over extreme algorithmic optimization, though Medium problems are still core.

This volume difference means that covering the Salesforce question list requires a broader, more sustained effort, while Twitter's list is more quickly scoped.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test foundational data structures. **Array, String, and Hash Table** are top topics for both, forming a critical common ground. Mastery here is non-negotiable for either interview.

The key differences lie in the secondary emphasis:

- **Salesforce** prominently features **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This aligns with the need for robust, optimized solutions to complex business logic and data processing problems common in enterprise software. Expect to see problems involving sequences, paths, or optimization.
- **Twitter** highlights **Design**. This reflects the system-scale challenges of a global social platform—handling real-time feeds, massive scale, and high concurrency. While coding is crucial, you must also be prepared for system design or object-oriented design discussions.

Here is a typical DP problem you might encounter at Salesforce, implemented in three languages:

<div class="code-group">

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

</div>

## Which to Prepare for First

Prepare for **Salesforce first**. The reasoning is straightforward: its question list is larger and covers a wider algorithmic scope, including the challenging DP topic. If you build a foundation capable of tackling Salesforce's Medium and Hard problems, you will automatically cover the core algorithmic ground needed for Twitter's coding rounds. The depth required for Salesforce ensures breadth and strength.

Your subsequent Twitter preparation then becomes a targeted refinement:

1.  **Review Twitter's specific list** of 53 questions to identify any unique patterns.
2.  **Shift significant focus to System Design.** This is a major differentiator. While Salesforce interviews may touch on design, it is a highlighted core topic for Twitter.
3.  Practice problems involving **real-time data streams, caching, and API design**, as these are more relevant to Twitter's domain.

In summary, use the extensive Salesforce problem set to build your algorithmic muscle. Then, pivot to master design principles and review Twitter's more focused question list. This approach maximizes the transferability of your preparation effort between the two interview processes.
