Hash Table questions appear in nearly one-quarter of Nutanix’s technical interview problems (16 out of 68 total). This frequency reflects their critical role in real-world distributed systems and cloud infrastructure. At Nutanix, engineers constantly optimize for performance and scalability—tasks where hash tables provide O(1) average-time lookups, inserts, and deletions. Whether you’re managing hyper-converged storage, handling metadata, or routing requests, efficient data retrieval is non-negotiable. Mastering hash tables demonstrates you can design systems that are both fast and resource-efficient, a core expectation for any role at the company.

## What to Expect — Types of Problems

Nutanix’s hash table questions typically fall into two categories. First, **direct applications** where you use a hash map or set to solve classic problems: finding duplicates, checking anagrams, implementing caches (LRU), or computing two-sum variations. These test your fluency with the standard library and understanding of time-space tradeoffs.

Second, **composite problems** where a hash table is one component of a more complex algorithm. You might pair it with a sliding window for substring problems, use it to store graph node states, or combine it with a heap for top-K frequency queries. These problems assess your ability to recognize when a hash table is the optimal auxiliary data structure to reduce time complexity, often from O(n²) to O(n). Expect questions grounded in practical scenarios like log analysis, request deduplication, or session tracking.

## How to Prepare — Study Tips with One Code Example

Focus on **pattern recognition**, not just memorization. The key is to identify when a problem requires fast lookups or needs to track counts/frequencies. Practice by first solving the problem with a brute-force approach, then introducing a hash table to optimize. Always articulate the time and space complexity trade-off.

A fundamental pattern is **using a hash map to store complements or needed values**. This turns a nested loop into a single pass. Consider the classic Two Sum problem: find two indices where their values sum to a target.

<div class="code-group">

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement), i];
    }
    seen.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}
```

</div>

The pattern is consistent: store each element as you iterate, and check for the required complement. This reduces the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

## Recommended Practice Order

Start with foundational problems to build intuition: Two Sum, First Unique Character, and Valid Anagram. Next, tackle frequency-count problems like Top K Frequent Elements and Subarray Sum Equals K. Then, move to advanced patterns combining hash tables with other structures: LRU Cache (hash map + doubly linked list) and sliding window problems like Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters. Finally, simulate interview conditions by solving Nutanix’s tagged problems on TidyBit under time constraints.
