Deliveroo’s coding interviews assess your ability to solve practical, scalable problems under pressure. The process typically involves one or two technical rounds focusing on algorithmic problem-solving, often conducted via platforms like HackerRank or in a collaborative IDE. Success hinges on a clear understanding of core data structures and the ability to write clean, efficient code.

## By the Numbers — Difficulty Breakdown and What It Means

Based on historical data, Deliveroo’s question distribution is:

- **Easy:** 1 question (17%)
- **Medium:** 3 questions (50%)
- **Hard:** 2 questions (33%)

This breakdown reveals a clear emphasis on intermediate to advanced problem-solving. The single easy question is often a warm-up or a screening filter. The bulk of the interview’s weight lies in the three medium questions, which test your core competency in applying algorithms to real-world scenarios like order routing or data processing. The two hard questions are the differentiators, designed to assess candidates for senior roles or those with exceptional problem-solving skills, often involving optimization or complex system design elements. Your preparation must be weighted accordingly: master mediums to pass, tackle hards to excel.

## Top Topics to Focus On

The most frequent topics form the essential toolkit for Deliveroo’s problems.

- **Array & String:** The foundation for most data manipulation tasks. Master two-pointer techniques and sliding windows.
- **Hash Table:** The go-to structure for O(1) lookups, essential for frequency counting and duplicate detection.
- **Sorting:** Often a prerequisite step for more complex algorithms. Understand efficient sorts and how to sort by custom keys.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Critical for shortest-path problems in grids or graphs, directly applicable to delivery route optimization.

The **Sliding Window** pattern is paramount for array/string problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings, such as finding the longest delivery route without repeats or a maximum sum under constraints.

```python
def max_subarray_sum_fixed(nums, k):
    """Returns max sum of any contiguous subarray of length k."""
    if len(nums) < k:
        return 0
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    return max_sum
```

```javascript
function maxSubarraySumFixed(nums, k) {
  if (nums.length < k) return 0;
  let windowSum = nums.slice(0, k).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let maxSum = windowSum;

  for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}
```

```java
public int maxSubarraySumFixed(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }
    int maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Preparation Strategy — A 4-6 Week Plan

A structured approach is non-negotiable.

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Topics**
Dedicate each day to one of the top topics (Array, String, Hash Table, Sorting, BFS). For each, study the fundamental patterns (e.g., two-pointer for arrays, adjacency list for BFS) and solve 5-8 LeetCode-style problems, starting with easy and progressing to medium.

**Weeks 3-4: Pattern Integration & Medium Mastery**
Stop studying topics in isolation. Focus exclusively on medium-difficulty problems that combine patterns (e.g., using a hash table within a sliding window). Aim for 2-3 problems daily, prioritizing timed practice. Begin reviewing Deliveroo-specific problems if available.

**Weeks 5-6: Hard Problems & Mock Interviews**
Allocate 60-70% of your time to hard problems, especially those involving graphs (BFS/DFS) and dynamic programming. Use the remaining time for full mock interviews (90 minutes, 2-3 problems) to simulate real pressure. Systematically analyze your mistakes.

## Key Tips

1.  **Communicate Relentlessly:** Think out loud. Before coding, state your brute-force approach, then explain your optimization. Interviewers evaluate your thought process as much as your final code.
2.  **Optimize for Readability First:** Write clear, modular code with sensible variable names. You can often mention potential micro-optimizations verbally without cluttering the implementation. Clean code is maintainable code.
3.  **Validate Input and Edge Cases:** Explicitly check for null, empty arrays, single-element inputs, and large values. State these checks. It demonstrates production-level thinking.
4.  **Practice on a Whiteboard or Plain Text Editor:** Do not become reliant on IDE auto-completion. You may be asked to code in a simple text field during the interview.

Master these patterns, follow the plan, and you'll be equipped to handle the algorithmic challenges Deliveroo presents.
