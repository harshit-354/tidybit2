When preparing for technical interviews, understanding the specific focus areas of your target companies can dramatically increase your efficiency. Samsung and Expedia, while both major tech employers, present distinct interview landscapes in terms of question volume, difficulty distribution, and core topics. This comparison breaks down their patterns to help you prioritize your study.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The data reveals a clear difference in both the number of questions and their difficulty profiles.

**Samsung** has a larger overall question bank of 69 questions. The difficulty distribution is heavily weighted towards medium and hard problems: 37 Medium (M37) and 17 Hard (H17), with only 15 Easy (E15). This suggests Samsung's interviews are rigorous, designed to thoroughly test a candidate's problem-solving skills under pressure. You must be comfortable with complex algorithmic challenges.

**Expedia**, with 54 total questions, has a more moderate volume. Its difficulty distribution is notably different: 35 Medium (M35), 13 Easy (E13), and only 6 Hard (H6). This indicates that while Expedia's process still requires strong competency, it places a greater emphasis on foundational and medium-level problem-solving rather than the most advanced, optimization-heavy questions. The low number of hard questions is a significant differentiator.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies share a strong emphasis on **Array** and **Hash Table** problems. These are fundamental data structures for handling collections and enabling efficient lookups, making them universal interview staples.

**Samsung's Unique Focus:** Samsung's list highlights **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Two Pointers** as key topics. DP questions are classic for testing optimal substructure and memoization, often appearing in medium to hard challenges. Two Pointers is a versatile technique for solving problems on sorted arrays or linked lists with optimal space.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Pointers (Find pair with target sum)
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Example: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Pointers (Find pair with target sum)
function twoSumSorted(numbers, target) {
  let left = 0,
    right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1];
    else if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
  }
  return [];
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example: Two Pointers (Find pair with target sum)
public int[] twoSumSorted(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = numbers.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        if (sum == target) return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return new int[]{};
}

// Example: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs)
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

**Expedia's Unique Focus:** Expedia emphasizes **String** manipulation and **Greedy** algorithms. String problems test careful indexing and edge-case handling, while Greedy algorithms assess the ability to make locally optimal choices for a globally optimal solution, common in scheduling or resource allocation problems.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Greedy (Maximum Subarray - Kadane's Algorithm)
def max_subarray(nums):
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
    return global_max
```

```javascript
// Example: Greedy (Maximum Subarray - Kadane's Algorithm)
function maxSubarray(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0],
    globalMax = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
    globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
  }
  return globalMax;
}
```

```java
// Example: Greedy (Maximum Subarray - Kadane's Algorithm)
public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
    int currentMax = nums[0], globalMax = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
        globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
    }
    return globalMax;
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Your preparation order should depend on your timeline and strengths.

Prepare for **Expedia first** if you are earlier in your interview preparation journey or prioritizing a slightly less daunting difficulty curve. The stronger focus on Strings, Arrays, and Hash Tables, combined with fewer hard problems, allows you to solidify core data structure skills. Mastering Expedia's pattern will build a robust foundation applicable to many companies.

Prepare for **Samsung first** if you are already comfortable with medium-level problems and need to ramp up for a highly challenging interview. The significant volume of medium and hard questions, especially in Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers, requires dedicated, advanced practice. Conquering Samsung's question bank will make most other interviews, including Expedia's, feel more manageable.

In practice, a strong candidate should be proficient in all the overlapping topics (Array, Hash Table). The decision hinges on whether you need to deepen your knowledge in DP/Two Pointers (Samsung) or Greedy/Strings (Expedia) and how comfortable you are with hard problem difficulty.
