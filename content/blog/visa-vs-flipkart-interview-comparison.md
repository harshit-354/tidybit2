When preparing for technical interviews, company-specific question patterns reveal what skills are truly tested. Visa and Flipkart, while both major recruiters of software engineers, show distinct profiles in their coding interview question banks. Visa's list leans heavily on fundamental data structures with a higher proportion of easier problems, whereas Flipkart's list is more challenging and algorithmically intensive, with a significant focus on dynamic programming. Understanding these differences allows you to tailor your preparation strategy effectively.

## Question Volume and Difficulty

The raw volume of questions is similar (Visa: 124, Flipkart: 117), but the difficulty distribution is markedly different.

Visa's question bank is categorized as **124 questions (Easy: 32, Medium: 72, Hard: 20)**. This indicates a strong emphasis on core problem-solving with a solid foundation. The high number of Easy and Medium problems suggests interviews often start with fundamentals to assess coding clarity and logical thinking before potentially escalating to more complex scenarios. The relatively lower proportion of Hard problems (16%) implies that while advanced topics are tested, they may not be the sole gatekeeper for all roles.

In contrast, Flipkart's bank is **117 questions (Easy: 13, Medium: 73, Hard: 31)**. This profile is significantly more challenging. With only ~11% Easy questions and a substantial 26.5% Hard questions, Flipkart's process is geared towards rigorously testing algorithmic depth and optimization skills from the outset. The high Medium count is consistent with both companies, representing the core of a technical interview.

## Topic Overlap

Both companies heavily test **Array**, **Hash Table**, and **Sorting**. These form the essential toolkit for problem-solving. Questions here often involve manipulation, searching, and efficient lookups.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example: Two Sum (Array & Hash Table)
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

# Sorting is frequently a prerequisite step.
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
nums.sort()  # Enables two-pointer or binary search techniques
```

```javascript
// Example: Two Sum (Array & Hash Table)
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Sorting usage
let nums = [3, 1, 4, 2];
nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

```java
// Example: Two Sum (Array & Hash Table)
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[0];
}

// Sorting usage
int[] nums = {3, 1, 4, 2};
Arrays.sort(nums);
```

</div>

The critical divergence is **Flipkart's strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This is a major differentiator. DP problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence, stock buying) require advanced pattern recognition and state optimization, aligning with Flipkart's higher difficulty profile. **Visa's list highlights String** problems, which often test edge-case handling and detailed implementation on top of core array/logic skills.

<div class="code-group">

```python
# Example DP (Flipkart focus): Climbing Stairs
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```

```javascript
// Example DP (Flipkart focus): Climbing Stairs
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}
```

```java
// Example DP (Flipkart focus): Climbing Stairs
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Which to Prepare for First

Start with **Visa's question list**. Its higher volume of Easy problems and focus on foundational topics (Array, String, Hash Table) provides an excellent ramp-up to solidify core data structure manipulation and build coding confidence. Mastering these fundamentals is a prerequisite for tackling Flipkart's more demanding set.

Once comfortable with core patterns, transition to **Flipkart's list** to deepen your skills. This requires dedicated study of Dynamic Programming patterns, advanced graph algorithms (implied by higher difficulty), and rigorous practice on Hard problems. The skills honed here will also make you over-prepared for the algorithmic depth required in Visa's harder questions.

In summary, use Visa's profile for foundational strength and Flipkart's for advanced algorithmic mastery. This progression builds competence efficiently.
